Making the unreal real: Humanoid robotics lending hand to China's innovation-led drive
 (Xinhua) 10:14, August 13, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- As the sun rises over southeastern Beijing's suburban E-Town, a captivating scene unfolds. Stretching slim arms and legs, jogging at a precise pace and practicing Tai Chi, the participants are not typical gray-haired people. They look stylish, energetic, and like human beings.
Yes, they aren't our kind -- they are humanoid robots.
As the rising stars in China's new innovation-fueled growth engines known as new quality productive forces, these human-like machines are flexing smart muscles to play a big role in turbocharging the country's long-term growth.
NASCENT YET PROMISING INDUSTRY
The black, metallic humanoid robot, named Tien Kung, is the brainchild of Beijing Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robotics Innovation Center, or HUMANOID.
Established late last year, the platform has already made a splash in the cutting-edge field globally with Tien Kung's debut in April.
Measuring 1.63 meters in height and 43 kilograms in weight, Tien Kung can maintain a steady running speed of 6 kilometers per hour. It has achieved the world's first anthropomorphic running of a full-size fully electric-driven embodied intelligent robot.
""It's a stride indeed in terms of technological progress,"" said Rick Xiong, the center's general manager and an industry veteran with over two decades of experience in the sector.
Featuring a sophisticated combination of state-of-the-art technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, humanoid robotics is an emerging high-end industry gaining global attention and investment. Xiong believes it's going to become a trillion-U.S. dollar industry with the potential to ""revolutionize how we live, work, and interact.""
Xiong envisions a future where humanoid robots could care for the elderly in nursing homes or seamlessly perform tasks in automobile factories. ""Impossible? It's already a reality in the making.""
In China, humanoid robots are beginning to venture out of labs and expos into workshops. Industrial giant UBTECH, which also has an office near HUMANOID in the ZGC E-Town International Robot Industrial Park, recently introduced its products in a smart automobile plant in east China, where they assist workers in carrying auto parts.
Xiong forecasts that humanoid robotics will be applied on a larger scale at home in the next three to five years.
An industrial report co-compiled by UBTECH and other partners predicts that the market size of humanoid robots in China will reach some 2.76 billion yuan in 2024 and is expected to reach 75 billion yuan by 2029, accounting for about a third of the global total. By 2035, the market is projected to expand even further, with a potential size of 300 billion yuan.
RIGHT TIMING, PLACE AND PEOPLE
Xiong attributed the fast growth of HUMANOID and the domestic industry to a nurturing ecosystem for humanoid robotics in China, citing the country's solid high-end manufacturing sector, a galloping AI market and a growing range of application scenarios.
China is home to the most comprehensive industrial system in the world, with a production and manufacturing system that is both globally unparalleled in scale and diverse in its range of sectors. It is also the largest market for robotics applications worldwide.
In E-Town, where HUMANOID is located, there are over 110 robotics companies, forming a sound industrial chain system covering robotics core components, complete machines, and applications.
With AI development flourishing in the world's second-largest economy, more than 4,500 companies are racing to enhance technologies, positioning China at the forefront of the global AI market. Complementing these industry advances is a supportive government policy framework.
Local governments have offered a set of supportive policies to help firms like HUMANOID grow. Nationally, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last year rolled out a guideline to expedite the industry's development.
To sharpen the edge of future industries including humanoid robotics, China will launch a series of scientific research projects, establish a number of incubators, support certain regions to explore and develop application scenarios and cultivate more industrial high-fliers, Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong told a press conference in July.
China's top economic planner also issued a document in June, encouraging the development of humanoid robots based on large-scale AI models to enrich consumption scenarios.
""There are combined efforts to shape the future in our favor,"" Xiong said. ""We have the right timing, place and people to accelerate the humanoid robotics push.""
TECHNOLOGY AND TEAMWORK
While staying upbeat on the nascent industry's outlook, Xiong cautioned against an irrational rush to jump onto the bandwagon.
HUMANOID is the first of its kind in the country, and within a year many Chinese tech hubs like Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wuhan have set up similar centers or alliances to pool resources to push the industry ahead. A throng of companies are also making forays into the burgeoning market.
While the West witnesses deep-pocketed industry giants dominating the robot landscape, China is characterized by a proliferation of small to medium-sized enterprises striving to navigate the competitive terrain, Xiong observed, adding that the latter might lack enough capital and technology reserves to withstand market risks brought by heated homogeneous competition that might lead to redundancies.
In a key policy meeting held last month, China's top leadership underscored the importance of developing new quality productive forces in line with local conditions.
""Technology is the major bottleneck checking the industry's development,"" Xiong said. ""It takes time, money, and most importantly teamwork to make real technological breakthroughs.""
HUMANOID will launch a versatile embodied intelligence body platform empowering the application of related technologies later this year, and like Tien Kung, it will be open to industry players at home and abroad to facilitate the whole industry, according to Xiong.
The company is also busy preparing to participate in the upcoming World Robot Conference to be held in E-Town. The event will see industrial heavyweights from countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany showcase the latest progress in the industry, with more than 20 humanoid robots set to make their debut.
Xiong is eager for the exchange of ideas and experiences with global peers. ""We are always open to global industrial cooperation,"" he said. ""Together, we can make the unreal real.""

Chinese physicists remember Nobel laureate Tsung-Dao Lee,2024-08-13,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0813/c90000-20205172.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese physicists remember Nobel laureate Tsung-Dao Lee
 (Xinhua) 10:12, August 13, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- A memorial service for Tsung-Dao Lee was held in Beijing on Sunday, at the Institute of High Energy Physics, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
About 330 academicians, experts, representatives of teachers and students, and people from all walks of life gathered to remember the Nobel laureate and Chinese-American physicist, who died at his home on Aug. 4 in San Francisco, California.
Lee, a foreign member of the CAS, was born in Shanghai on Nov. 24, 1926, with ancestral roots in Suzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province. In 1946, he went to the United States to study and later engaged in research at various universities and research institutions in the country.
In 1956, Lee, together with Yang Zhenning, proposed the assertion that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. After experimental verification the following year, they were jointly awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Zhang Huanqiao, who is over 90 years old and a CAS academician, still remembered the time when they won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
""At that time, I had just started my career, and the explosive news greatly inspired me,"" he said. From that moment on, he became even more steadfast in his conviction to contribute to China's scientific endeavors.
Since 1972, Lee has returned to China on many occasions to give lectures and offer advice for universities and research institutions.
After the reform and opening up, he spared no effort in promoting the advancement of science education in China, such as the contribution to establishment of the ""Special Class for the Gifted Young"" at the University of Science and Technology of China, the promotion of the China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application program, and the proposal to set up the postdoctoral mobile station system in China.
Gao Yuanning, dean of the School of Physics, Peking University, and a CAS academician, remembered Lee's great contribution to the promotion of academic research at the university.
Lee proposed the establishment of the Beijing Institute of Modern Physics and the Center for High Energy Physics at Peking University, and served as the directors of the two institutions himself, which have facilitated the cultivation of young talent and international research cooperation in fields like particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics and cosmology.
Lee also made significant contributions to the cultivation of academic research and talent in Chinese universities such as Tsinghua University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Fudan University and Zhejiang University.
In April 1983, the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPC) program was officially approved, and in October 1988, it achieved the first electron-positron collision. This marked another major breakthrough in China's high-tech sector following the successful detonation of atomic and hydrogen bombs and the launch of artificial satellites.
From the selection of physics research objectives to the finalization of the accelerator design, and from talent cultivation to engineering management, Lee played a crucial role in BEPC construction.
""At that time, it started from scratch, and many people thought it was impossible to make it,"" said Wang Yifang, director of the Institute of High Energy Physics.
Lee leveraged his international influence and assisted in solving numerous challenges through various channels, playing a vital role, added Wang, who is also a CAS academician.

China's new homegrown twin-engine unmanned transport aircraft, with a maximum range of 1,800 kilometers, is a milestone in the country's low-altitude technology, the manufacturer of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) told the Global Times on Monday, adding that the development of the UAV, which only takes 15 minutes to load cargo, will significantly raise regional logistics efficiency.
The UAV, designed to meet rising market demand, completed its maiden flight test on Sunday in Zigong, Sichuan Province, Southwest China. The groundbreaking UAV went from development to its first flight in just over a year, producer Sichuan Tengden Sci-tech Innovation Co told the Global Times in an exclusive interview on Monday.
Analysts said such rapid success highlights the maker's leading position in UAV technology and reflects China's achievements in its booming low-altitude sector.
The aircraft, designed for regional logistics routes of 600 to 1,800 kilometers, will address the inadequate payload capacity and range seen in similar products, a manager of the company who requested anonymity told the Global Times.
""It proved that large-scale commercial adoption of unmanned regional logistics is feasible, and is expected to drive technological advancements in the industry that better meet the expanding market demand,"" the manager added.
This UAV breaks new ground in regional logistics efficiency by using cutting-edge technologies, reflecting China's prowess in rapid low-altitude technological innovation. It boasts high automation, with more than 90 percent of its functions controllable by a single button during routine flights, streamlining operations and making it highly suitable for widespread use in unmanned cargo transport.
With the largest cargo hold in its class, the UAV increases space utilization by 15 percent. It is designed to fit standard cargo containers and allows for seamless integration with mainline transport without disassembly. It requires only 15 minutes for cargo loading and unloading.
The aircraft also features a high-altitude performance with a ceiling of 7,000 meters, making it ideal for global cargo transport, the company noted, saying it covers more than 90 percent of feeder routes globally and has advanced fireproofing and anti-icing features for enhanced safety.
To address technical challenges, the company employed an entirely composite structure to reduce the UAV's weight, thereby maximizing cargo space and capacity. It also integrated its latest autopilot technology to enhance the UAV's ease of use.
""This approach, involving the design of a new model from scratch, has proven to be more demanding in terms of product design and implementation compared with merely modifying and upgrading existing models,"" the manager said.
China's unmanned logistics industry is picking up pace with the growing use of drones and smart systems, as domestic airspace and flight route management systems open faster and the construction of general aviation airports accelerates.
For instance, Central China's Henan Province recently issued a plan to enhance low-altitude economic development, aiming to build about 10 general aviation airports and a batch of helicopter and drone landing sites by 2025 to complete the province's low-altitude infrastructure, people.cn reported on Monday.

"Jiangsu builds ""experimental fields"" of basic research to unleash vitality for innovation",2024-08-13,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0813/c90000-20205156.html,"Home>>
		
Jiangsu builds ""experimental fields"" of basic research to unleash vitality for innovation
By He Cong, Yao Xueqing (People's Daily) 09:47, August 13, 2024
In June 2023, east China's Jiangsu province planned to establish three basic science centers as part of its efforts to deepen reforms in the scientific and technological system and talent development mechanisms.
These centers, focusing on physics, applied mathematics, and synthetic biology, are being piloted in research universities and other scientific institutions to reform the basic research system. In just one year, a number of groundbreaking results have emerged from these young ""experimental fields"" of basic research.
Among them, the provincial center for physics science (PCPS) in Jiangsu province, which is backed by Nanjing University, has made significant strides in original research.

At the quantum extreme measurement laboratory of the School of Physics, Nanjing University, professor Du Lingjie and his doctoral students are at the forefront of innovative research. Every day, they search for signals of new quasi-particles from excitation peaks, akin to finding a needle in a haystack.
In their experiments, the flickering red laser beams keep changing energy levels, striking semiconductor samples in a cooling machine. The signals are instantly captured and displayed on a computer screen as excitation peaks that look like an electrocardiogram. Each peak represents a collision between an electron and a photon.
The team examines hundreds of these excitation peaks per day, trying to identify the elusive signals. ""Where is the signal? What does it look like? How long will it take to find it?"" These are the questions that drive their research, with no guarantees of success.
In the first half of 2023, Du and his team encountered challenges in their research: experiments that needed to be redesigned, a need for continuous capital input, and unknown prospects of the studies. This entirely new research was not included in any scientific project guidelines. Despite these challenges, Du received unwavering support from Wang Bogen, dean of the School of Physics, Nanjing University.
Wang's confidence came from the commitment of China's ""experimental fields"" to reforming the scientific and technological system. This reform grants researchers substantial autonomy in their scientific pursuits and encourages them to ""propose new theories, pioneer new fields, explore new paths, and focus on independent innovation.""
In 2023, Jiangsu province invested 130 million yuan ($18.14 million) to establish three basic research centers - the PCPS and other two provincial centers for applied mathematical sciences and foundational research in synthetic biology, among which the PCPS received a funding of 50 million yuan.

""The strong research support and sufficient financial guarantee were like a lifeline for our research,"" said Du. On March 28 this year, their significant research findings were published on Nature. This marked the world's first discovery of quasi-particles with graviton-like characteristics in real systems.
At a future computing laboratory of the PCPS, a four-layer ""atomic building block"" electronic device is clearly visible under a microscope. This groundbreaking development is the work of professor Miao Feng's research team from the School of Physics, Nanjing University.
""In traditional materials, electrons move without a unified direction. However, when in the topological edge states of quantum matter they move in a consistent direction, much like vehicles on a highway,"" said Miao.
His team has successfully integrated this ""highway"" concept into ""atomic building blocks,"" constructing special electronic devices for brain-like computing. This significant achievement was recently published in the prestigious journal Nature Nanotechnology.
According to Ma Yuqiang, head and chief scientist of PCPS, project leaders are free to allocate research funds based on their judgment, which enables them to maximize the impact of limited resources, create cross-departmental, cross-disciplinary, and cross-industry teams, and bring together top talent.
Education, science and technology, and human resources are the foundational and strategic pillars for Chinese modernization. ""The establishment and operation of the three basic science centers in Jiangsu province would help explore the integrated reform of education, science and technology, and talent systems, continuously unleash the inexhaustible drive for scientific research, and foster a vibrant atmosphere for innovation and creation,"" said Xu Guanghui, head of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology.

"Smart tech cultivates fertile, high-yield lands across China",2024-08-12,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0812/c90000-20204954.html,"Home>>
		
Smart tech cultivates fertile, high-yield lands across China
 (Xinhua) 15:59, August 12, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite recent persistent rain in central China's Henan Province, Shen Jifeng's 600-mu (about 40 hectares) of contracted farmlands in the city of Xinxiang have largely avoided waterlogging.
Outfitted with water pumps, sprinklers and smart sensors, these farmlands in the Pingyuan Pilot Zone of Xinxiang are part of ""high-standard cropland"" supported by modern infrastructure and advanced technologies.
""The land has been leveled, and drainage ditches have been added along the edges, allowing water to drain quickly from the fields,"" Shen said.
""High-standard cropland"" has been written into a resolution adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in July.
According to this resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization, the country will improve the mechanisms for developing, verifying, managing, and protecting high-standard cropland, as one of the concrete measures of deepening reform of the land system.
High-standard cropland, also called well-facilitated farmland, requires sci-tech support for disaster prevention and control, soil quality and fertility improvement, and farmland management based on information technology.
The CPC and the Chinese government have stressed the importance of high-standard cropland in important meetings and documents, including the government work report delivered during the second session of the 14th National People's Congress this March.
According to a 10-year development plan released in 2021, China will build 1.2 billion mu of high-standard cropland, and renovate and upgrade 280 million mu of existing high-standard cropland by 2030.
By then, the country aims to achieve stable grain production of over 600 billion kilograms per year, ensuring basic self-sufficiency in grain and security for staple food supplies.
The high-standard cropland, which is in line with modern agricultural production and management, will significantly save water, energy, fertilizers and labor for farmers, and increase the yield.
In Shen's case, over 100 mu of his land is equipped with automatic irrigation systems that can be controlled from his smartphone.
This not only conserves water but also enables the mixing of liquid fertilizers with water for field application, significantly reducing the need for manual labor, he said, adding that combined with improvements in crop varieties and other factors, the yield of wheat per mu in his fields has increased by 100 to 150 kg.
Various sensors have also played a crucial role. In the Pingyuan Pilot Zone, over 20 agricultural data poles equipped with solar panels, high-definition cameras, atmospheric sensors and soil sensors collect and transmit data. This information helps generate detailed insights about weather, soil and crops through large model calculation for Shen and other farmers.
Other devices, such as pest radars and fungal spore collectors, provide local farmers with alerts for pests and diseases.
The pest radar uses 32-mm radar waves to track and predict the timing, location, swarm density and migration trajectory of flying insects within a 20 km radius, offering precise guidance for pest prevention and control.
All these data and information are consolidated into ""Zhongyuan Nonggu,"" a sci-tech innovation platform featuring four major big data models for weather, soil, fertility and plant transpiration.
""Agriculture differs from industry in that agricultural data are challenging to standardize. We are still training the four large models with additional data. As the number of data poles increases, more data will be fed into these models,"" explained Yin Yue, project manager of Zhongyuan Nonggu.
Such practices are being implemented nationwide, ushering in the future of smart agriculture in China.
The country had completed the development of more than 1 billion mu of high-standard cropland by the end of 2023, according to Chen Bangxun, a senior official at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.
In Tumd Left Banner in Hohhot in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the local government established a corn planting demonstration zone with nearly 960 mu of high-standard cropland.
It features an integrated platform for intelligent control and remote video monitoring, enabling real-time oversight of the entire planting and management process in the zone.
Supported by Internet-of-Things devices such as monitoring stations, sensors and control valves, the platform can collect data on crop growth, leaf surface condition and pest movement, providing fertilization and management recommendations to farmers.
Farmers can also monitor environmental temperature, humidity, soil pH and light intensity on their smartphones through dedicated apps.
Liu Ruifei, head of a local agricultural tech promotion center, said that the local government will continue to integrate modern technologies and equipment into the demonstration zone, and help farmers achieve green production in agriculture.
According to Yu Qiangyi, a researcher with the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning (IARRP), under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, smart agriculture can boost the efficiency of farming operations, alleviate labor shortage, protect and improve the agricultural ecosystem, reduce the cost of production, improve the quality of produce, and shift agriculture from experience-based to data-driven practice.
""Smart agriculture leverages data from sensors and the Internet of Things as a crucial production factor, driving automation, unmanned operations and intelligent management in farming,"" said Yu, who is also the team leader of smart agriculture research in IARRP.

Underscoring Qualcomm's confidence in the long-term prospects of the Chinese economy, Meng said, ""Qualcomm has consistently considered China as a pivotal business partner and valued customer, viewing it as more than just a market or a link in the supply chains"".
Denis Depoux, global managing director of market consultancy Roland Berger, said that China has emerged as a strong player in the global landscape of R&D. For instance, the country has the world's largest number of patent applications, and its R&D spending exceeded 3.3 trillion yuan ($454 billion) in 2023, second only to the US.
""But innovation needs more than just money. The resolution provides a clear roadmap for what China needs to do to become a truly innovation-driven country over the next five years,"" Depoux said.
For instance, the meeting highlighted efforts to improve the policy and governance systems for promoting the development of strategic industries such as next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, aviation and aerospace, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, biomedicine, and quantum technology, and steer emerging industries toward sound and orderly development.
The high priority attached to industries like quantum technology has inspired him, said Hu Wei, a researcher at the University of Science and Technology of China and founder of Hanhai Quantum, a startup in Hefei, Anhui province.
 
""This is an epoch-making and landmark meeting. China, like a giant ship, is steadily advancing in a determined direction, bringing opportunities, confidence and, mutual benefit to the world. An open China provides a continuous flow of positive energy to the world,"" Hu said.
""For our quantum enterprise, this signifies that there will be more policy support in the future, which will help promote the research and application of quantum technology. As the comprehensive deepening of reforms progresses, the demand for technological innovation will increase.
""The immense potential of quantum technology in fields such as new material prediction, intelligent data analysis, and computational science makes it an important direction for future technological development. This fills us with confidence and anticipation for the future of the industry.""
Dong Yu, executive vice-president of the China Institute for Development Planning at Tsinghua University, said the meeting reflects the need for tailored institutional mechanisms to support the distinct characteristics of emerging, future, and traditional industries.
""For instance, fostering emerging industries requires mechanisms that support technological and industrial innovation, while sustainable investment mechanisms are essential for nurturing future industries. For traditional industries, the focus is on using standards to support transformation and upgrading,"" Dong said.
The resolution also called for improving the systems for promoting full integration between the real economy and the digital economy, which has inspired many entrepreneurs.
Pan Yejiang, chairman of Chinese home appliances company Vatti, said, ""New industrialization focuses on new concepts, technological innovation, and high-quality development, aiming to achieve the integration of digital, intelligent, and green aspects in manufacturing.""
Pan said Vatti is all set to embrace technological innovation and digital technology to enable intelligent manufacturing in the kitchen appliances industry.
Last year, Vatti invested 1.2 billion yuan in building an appliance, digital, and intelligent industrial park in Zhongshan, Guangdong province. The new industrial park will be benchmarked against world-class factories, applying digital technologies to enable data-driven, efficient decision-making, and flexible production capabilities, accelerating the company's transition to digitalization and intelligent manufacturing, Vatti said.
Upon completion by the end of this year, the industrial park will have an annual production capacity of 3 million kitchen appliances. This will result in an additional annual output value of 4 billion yuan and an additional annual tax revenue of 140 million yuan, creating thousands of new jobs, the company said.

The resolution's emphasis that education, science and technology, and talent function as basic and strategic underpinnings for Chinese modernization is also echoed by many experts.
Wan Jinbo, a researcher at the Institutes of Science and Development at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, ""Integrating reforms across education, science, and talent is essential for achieving cohesive and integrated development, which is critical for supporting China's modernization.""
The comments came after China, for the first time, replaced the United States as the largest contributor to high-quality natural-science research by ranking No. 1 in the share of papers published in top journals in 2022, according to the Nature Index, a report released by Springer Nature Group, an internationally renowned science and technology publishing house.
In 2023, a year after health science publications were added to the Nature Index, China was top overall, said Springer in its latest report.
But China still faces many challenges in nurturing talent, and efforts are needed to boost international scientific and technological cooperation, which is an inevitable trend, and fundamental research serves as an important channel for promoting such cooperation, experts said.
Dou Xiankang, head of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, said, ""We must balance development and security, expand openness based on independent innovation, and actively integrate into the global innovation network.""
Aware of the challenges and risks ahead, the resolution also called for improving the systems to enhance the resilience and security of industry and supply chains. It said China will move faster to build industry and supply chains that are self-supporting and risk-controllable, and improve the institutions and mechanisms for bolstering key industrial chains like integrated circuits.
Hu Weiwu, chairman of Loongson Technology, one of the few Chinese chip companies that have developed its own processor architecture, rather than relying on licensed designs from foreign companies, highlighted the meeting's significance, especially as China enters a critical period for high-quality economic development.
""Loongson is at a crucial transition stage, shifting from technology catch-up to ecosystem building, from policy-driven development to venturing into open market competitions, and from a follower to an independent innovator. We will work hard to achieve high-quality development and help foster a self-supporting and risk-controllable information technology ecosystem in China,"" Hu said.
Deng Zhonghan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, emphasized the importance of mastering core technologies for national long-term development. He called for the collective efforts of government, enterprises, research institutions, and the broader scientific community to cultivate innovative talent, a critical focus for future work.

(COMAC) during the Farnborough International Airshow in Farnborough, Britain, July 22, 2024. The 2024 Farnborough International Airshow closed on July 26. (Photo: Xinhua)
As Air China has finished test flights for its first C919 aircraft, the three major domestic airlines are at a promising stage for commercial operations of the home-made aircraft, market insiders said.
The C919 reportedly got positive feedback from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and market watchers said that it could help the aircraft further open up the European market and win more international users.
According to the Weibo account of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China, Air China's first C919 passenger aircraft made its first test flight on Friday and is scheduled to be delivered at the end of August.
Earlier, Air China unveiled its cabin layout, which has two classes providing 158 seats - eight in business class and 150 in economy. This is the loosest cabin layout known to the C919 passenger aircraft.
China Southern Airlines finished its first C919 test flight in Shanghai on August 3. In July, China Eastern Airlines, the world's first operator of the plane, received its seventh C919. Maiden commercial flights began in May 2023.
The successful test flight of Air China is a clear sign that the C919 is winning more confidence among airlines, and it is expected to speed up commercial operations of the aircraft, Qi Qi, a market insider, told the Global Times on Sunday.
As more C919s enter commercial service and add flight hours, it will inject more confidence and win more orders from users and potential customers, Qi added.
The C919 is a large civilian jet aircraft developed in accordance with international civilian aviation regulations and with independent intellectual property rights, and it is regarded as a model to grab a share of the global civilian aviation market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
In 2022, China Eastern Airlines officially took delivery of the world's first C919, making it the world's first operator of the plane. As of August 3, the fleet of C919s had made 3,133 commercial flights and carried nearly 420,000 passengers.
Moreover, there is some positive news for the C919 to tap the European market. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Friday that China's civil aviation authorities have become more optimistic about receiving EU certification in 2025 after an on-the-ground check of the C919 by EU regulators last month in Shanghai.
The SCMP reported that the EASA delegation gave positive feedback, citing a source.
Before the C919's entering the international market, it is necessary to obtain airworthiness certifications from the civilian aviation administration authorities of overseas countries.
Obtaining type certifications from the US Federal Aviation Administration and EASA are important indicators for the C919 to expand into the international market, Qi said, adding that the positive feedback will help the C919 further open up the European market and win more international users.
Global orders placed for the C919 have exceeded 1,000.
China Eastern took the lead in signing an agreement with the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China to order an additional 100 C919 aircraft, beyond the first five.
Air China announced in April that it had ordered 100 C919s, to be delivered from 2024 to 2031. Separately, 100 C919s have been ordered by China Southern Airlines.
Jinpeng Airlines, also known as Suparna Airlines, said in July that it will receive its first C919 aircraft in the fourth quarter of this year, making it the first private carrier in the world to operate the domestically developed plane.

BEIJING, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- Industry analysts have hailed China's newly-launched satellite group as both a technological leap and a strategic move in the low Earth orbit internet industry.
The satellite group was sent into space on Tuesday from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi Province, north China.
The 18 satellites are the first batch of the first generation of Spacesail satellites. The Spacesail Constellation will provide global users with low-latency, high-speed and ultra-reliable satellite broadband internet services, according to launch service provider China Great Wall Industry Corporation.
The constellation's potential to provide seamless, high-speed internet access worldwide underscores China's commitment to bridging the digital divide and seizing opportunities in the burgeoning satellite internet sector, according to latest research notes released by several securities brokerages.
WHAT IS SPACESAIL?
The Spacesail project commenced in 2023 and is set to unfold in three phases. The first phase, expected to conclude by the end of 2025, will see 648 satellites providing regional network coverage. By 2027, the second phase will expand this to global coverage with an additional 648 satellites.
The ambitious third phase, aiming for completion by 2030, plans to have a staggering total of 15,000 satellites offer mobile direct-connect multiservice integration. The year 2024 is projected to witness the launch of 108 satellites.
Analysts from Minsheng Securities highlight that China has planned three ""ten-thousand-star constellations,"" with the Spacesail Constellation being one of them. The other two are the GW constellation, which aims to create a constellation of 13,000 satellites, and the Honghu-3 constellation, which plans to launch 10,000 satellites across 160 orbital planes.
The Spacesail satellites are designed using digitalization and modular production methods, which are expected to significantly enhance the efficiency of satellite development. The first batch of 18 commercial network satellites, each weighing 300 kg, utilizes a stackable flat satellite platform independently developed by a Shanghai aerospace firm.
The launch vehicle, the Long March-6A, is China's new generation of medium-lift hybrid rockets.
WHY IT MATTERS
The launch is a milestone in China's commercial aerospace history and a significant step into the global satellite internet arena.
Analysts from Huachuang Securities note that the deployment for satellite internet is of profound significance. It is imperative to seize strategic resources and embrace an integrated space and terrestrial network.
The scarcity of satellite frequency and orbital resources, governed by the ""first come, first served"" principle, adds urgency to the deployment. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) stipulates that satellite frequencies and orbital resources must be fully deployed within seven years of declaration, or the scale of the declared constellation will be reduced.
The advent of mobile direct-connect services, following the release of smartphones equipped with ""direct to device"" capabilities, has opened up the civilian market for satellite internet.
The integration of satellite and terrestrial networks has achieved a significant breakthrough, with space-Earth communication expected to be closely integrated in the era of 6G communication, as envisioned by the ITU.
A research note by Kaiyuan Securities recognized the Tuesday launch of the first group of satellites as the beginning of building China's low Earth orbit internet constellation, calling it a landmark event in the history of China's commercial aerospace endeavors.
THE BIGGER PICTURE
Satellite orbits are primarily categorized into three types: geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and low Earth orbit (LEO).
Compared to the other two categories, LEO satellites boast several advantages, including proximity to Earth, minimal transmission latency, low link losses, and flexible launch capabilities. They are an integral component of the future integrated network that encompasses the sky, space, and sea.
China places great emphasis on the coordinated development of the GEO, MEO and LEO satellites to build an integrated space-Earth information network.
The satellite internet is recognized as part of the new infrastructure in the information sector, and was first included in the new infrastructure concept in April 2020 by the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for the information communication industry development targets the coordinated development of high, medium and low-orbit satellites and the deep integration of satellite communication systems with terrestrial information communication systems.
The Central Economic Work Conference in December 2023 defined commercial aerospace as a strategic emerging industry. The 2024 government work report proposed to actively create new growth engines such as bio-manufacturing, commercial aerospace, and low-altitude economy.
The Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing governments have also released plans for the aerospace information industry, providing fertile ground for the incubation and cultivation of the satellite internet industry.
On Aug. 6, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a guideline on innovating the management of the information communication industry and optimizing the business environment.
It mentioned orderly promoting the reform of satellite internet business access system to better support the development of private telecommunications enterprises.

Shenzhou-18 taikonauts conduct fire alarm test, blood sampling in space
 (Xinhua) 16:49, August 08, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhou-18 crew on board China's orbiting space station conducted a fire alarm test recently, evaluating the performance of the fire detection sensors within the three-module craft.
The China Manned Space Agency has released video updates from space, showing the three taikonauts using specialized tools to activate temperature and smoke detectors, which in turn triggered fire alarms for lighting and instruments.
The trio also collected blood samples. In addition to routine blood examinations conducted in orbit, some samples will be preserved at low temperatures and transported back to Earth after the mission for further medical study.
They underwent a range of medical checks related to blood pressure, heart rate and lung function, according to the space agency.
The Shenzhou-18 crew have completed more than half of their six-month space journey since they were launched in late April. They performed two spacewalks and several scientific experiments in orbit.

China's recent retrieval of the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has renewed talks about the possibilities of the United States and China joining in space-based research programs aimed at addressing global challenges, particularly climate change.
""The US and China each have very innovative space programs, and one area, for example, where the US and China could work together today would be space-based solar,"" Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and founding director of the university's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, told China Daily.
Space-based solar power, a concept involving the collection of solar energy in outer space via satellites and its distribution to Earth, has been gaining traction globally. As countries worldwide invest in research and development for the technology, international organizations are simultaneously pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The decreasing costs associated with launching materials into space have made the idea of deploying large, kilometer-square, mylar solar panels — which beam power back to Earth using microwaves — increasingly feasible.
Kammen, who was a coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Nobel Peace Prize-winning report in 2007, suggested that the US and China could challenge each other to collaborate on making space-based solar a reality.
He emphasized the continuous nature of this energy source: ""Space-based solar is on 24/7. There is no nighttime in space. And so, adding space-based solar could be beaming power to Los Angeles to Beijing, to Guangzhou to Shenzhen to San Francisco.""
Both nations already have made significant strides in this field. In the United States, Caltech's space solar power prototype, launched into orbit last year, has successfully demonstrated its ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power to Earth for the first time.
Meanwhile, NASA is developing technologies that will indirectly benefit space-based solar power, including projects focused on autonomous systems, wireless power beaming and in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing, according to a NASA report early this year.
China, for its part, has achieved a milestone in its efforts to build a space solar power station in 2022. The China Academy of Space Technology has plans for a space high-voltage transfer and wireless power transmission experiment to be conducted in low Earth orbit by 2028, as outlined in its 2022 publication in the journal China Space Science and Technology.
Kammen acknowledged the political sensitivities surrounding such collaboration, particularly regarding data transfers and information-sharing. Despite those challenges, he saw opportunities for cooperation in other areas as well, such as fusion power.
He cited the advanced research being conducted at Tsinghua University and China's fusion reactor as potential areas for joint efforts in deployment and new research.
Drawing inspiration from popular culture, Kammen referred to the movie The Martian, in which a stranded American astronaut is rescued through a joint effort between the US and China. He saw the fictional scenario as an example of how the two nations could work together in reality, combining their respective technological strengths to achieve common goals.
""There's an opportunity to work peacefully together in space, to show that no matter who's going to be on the moon next, we have a chance to do clean energy in space as a bridge,"" said Kammen. Both countries have interests in lunar exploration, with the discovery of significant water ice on the moon opening up new possibilities. Potentially high-value materials on the moon, as well as resources on Mars and asteroids, present further opportunities for joint ventures that could benefit both nations while protecting their individual intellectual property, he said.
""That's an exciting opportunity,"" said Kammen, and stressed the urgency of doing so. ""We're going to need those breakthroughs because both the US and China are behind schedule to meet their climate goals,"" he said.
The US has aimed to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the Chinese goal is to realize carbon neutrality by 2060.

New energy vehicles reshape the industrial ecosystem,2024-08-08,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0808/c90000-20203522.html,"Home>>
		
New energy vehicles reshape the industrial ecosystem
 (People's Daily Online) 14:09, August 08, 2024
New energy vehicles (NEVs) are shifting from being a “new force” to a “new trend”. Statistics reveal that in the first half of April this year, the wholesale and retail penetration rates of passenger NEVs exceeded 50 percent, achieving the planned targets 11 years ahead of time.
China has become the world’s largest consumer market for NEVs and has established a highly efficient and collaborative industrial system.
R&D: 100,000 workers strong
BYD is one of China’s largest NEV manufacturers and battery makers. On its quest to enhance competitiveness through innovation, the company employs over 100,000 workers committed to just R&D, along with 11 research institutes.

Its investment has paid off with the introduction of the blade battery in March 2020.
For a long time, the automotive industry struggled to achieve both battery safety and a long travel range. The blade battery was BYD’s solution as it maintained the safety qualities of traditional lithium iron phosphate batteries while allowing for a longer driving range thanks to higher density and space utilization.
“Compared to traditional lithium iron phosphate batteries, blade batteries increase space utilization rate by around 40 percent,” explained Lian Yubo, chief scientist, chief automotive engineer, and director of the Automotive Engineering Research Institute at BYD. Lian added that the blade battery can be installed directly onto the car chassis, further improving space utilization and system safety.
The blade battery has become a flagship product for BYD, and along with other innovations produced by the company, has been proven to be a “driving force” for its success.
This focus on technology and R&D has paid off for the NEV industry as a whole. According to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the market share of China’s domestic brands overseas continues to rise. In the first half of the year, the export of domestically produced new energy vehicles reached 605,000 units, marking a 13.2 percent year-on-year increase.
Testing: 1,172 scenarios and counting

Dou, who has accumulated over 120,000 kilometers testing different vehicle types, said that a new vehicle model goes through a testing phase lasting 8 to 10 months before being introduced to the public.
Due to the rising demand for NEVs and evolving consumer needs, Dou’s testing responsibilities have increased. The number of testing projects has expanded from a few initial tests to 28 primary tests and 145 secondary tests.
The testing scenarios have also grown from 322 to 1,172, encompassing a wide range of scenarios including external discharge, camping in the car with air conditioning, vehicle-to-vehicle charging, wireless fast charging for mobile phones, and in-car karaoke.
“These new scenarios are what NEV automakers compete over,” Dou says with a laugh.
“The problems should only be fed back to the company, not left for the user.” This is the guiding principle that drives Dou and his team forward.
On August 2, Changan Nevo under Changan, announced its latest delivery data. The company delivered 12,445 vehicles in July and a total of 85,413 vehicles from January to July.
By 2030, Changan will invest a total of 200 billion yuan (about $27.85 billion) and add over 10,000 new employees to its technology innovation team in areas such as intelligence, new energy, and forward-looking technologies.
Ecosystem: Over 90 percent localization rate
Currently, China’s NEV industry is accelerating the clustering of “chains”. Both upstream and downstream small and medium-sized companies are taking advantage of this opportunity, joining the NEV ecosystem for growth while supporting the industrial chain.
Data reveals that thanks to a complete industrial chain, major NEV manufacturers in China have achieved a component localization rate of over 90 percent, with some even surpassing 95 percent.
At a factory of NEV manufacturer Lynk & Co located in Yuyao city, a county-level city administered by Ningbo, east China’s Zhejiang Province, a new energy vehicle rolls off the production line every 72 seconds, while car seats from a branch of Magna, a global developer and manufacturer of complete seating systems, are directly delivered to the assembly workshop of Lynk & Co in several hours.
The establishment of the NEV project of Lynk & Co in the China-Italy (Ningbo) Ecological Park in Yuyao has attracted 17 automotive supporting companies.

Magna, which had just over 100 staff members in 2018 when it first settled in the ecological park, has doubled its workforce and increased monthly seat production from around 4,000 to nearly 10,000 units, according to Huang Fei, deputy general manager of the company’s factory.
Currently, Yuyao has formed an industrial foundation that includes whole vehicles, lightweight automotive components, battery systems, and in-car optical devices, with upstream and downstream companies rapidly gathering.
Across the country, “little giants” are thriving thanks to the NEV industrial ecosystem.
“From January to June this year, the sales of LS series capacitor winding machines surged to 1.5 times the figure of the same period last year,” said Yu Shengwu, general manager of Savy Machine, located in Xinbei district, Changzhou city, east China’s Jiangsu Province.

China initiates microwave remote sensing experiments for vegetation, soil moisture

SHIJIAZHUANG, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently initiated remote sensing experiments for vegetation and soil moisture in north China's Hebei Province, according to the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
""Vegetation plays a crucial role in the transfer of water between the land and the atmosphere, acting not only as a reservoir for terrestrial water resources but also as a natural water pump,"" said Husi Letu, a researcher from the AIR.
""Traditional studies on water transfer have been limited to the microscale, which restricts our understanding of the water balance of entire ecosystems. There is an urgent need to develop modern technological methods capable of observation on a larger spatial scale,"" he added.
The experiments, based on an aviation platform, primarily utilized microwave technology for precise observation of forests, farmlands, and grasslands in the Saihanba mechanized forest farm and the Yudaokou ranch.
Microwaves possess strong penetration capabilities, enabling them to pass through clouds and vegetation, and function normally even at night and in rainy weather.
""Through multichannel microwave synergistic observation, researchers can delve into the internal moisture status and distribution of plants, and meticulously analyze the entire moisture transfer process from the soil to the plant stems, through the canopy and into the atmosphere,"" said Zhao Tianjie, a researcher from the AIR.
The data obtained from the experiment will be used to develop and verify intelligent remote sensing methods for key parameters of the terrestrial water cycle at various spatiotemporal scales, such as soil moisture, plant moisture, plant water potential, atmospheric water vapor and evapotranspiration.
Researchers can further capture the internal moisture changes of plants through aerospace technology, and understand the complex interactions between the soil moisture supply and the atmospheric water demand.
The experiment result will provide technical support for the processing and innovative applications of new payload observation data for domestic satellites such as the terrestrial water resources satellites and the ocean salinity detection satellites.
It will offer a scientific basis for further enhancing the soil water storage capacity and water productivity of forests, and increasing the capacity for conservation and regulation of water resources.

A village in Yongde county, Lincang city, southwest China’s Yunnan Province presents a stunning view: neatly arranged rows of blooming Rosa chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rose, stretch out like a sea of flowers.
For a long time, despite its rich germplasm resources, Yongde has been overlooked as a major player in the rose industry, much like how a good wine can go unnoticed if its too far off the beaten path.
This was a nationwide issue, as discovered in 2012 by Li Shubin, a doctoral student at the time. During a research visit to France’s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE), he realized that the lack of Chinese developed varieties of the Chinese rose was perplexing even to foreigners.
That was particularly striking given that China possesses about half of the world’s wild Rosa chinensis and Rosaceae resources and Yunnan accounts for half of the national total.

After extensively studying the breeding and marketing of roses in Europe, Li returned to Yunnan, dedicating himself to developing new varieties of the flower.
The road of scientific research is long and arduous. Faced with challenges such as the lack of Chinese intellectual property rights for rose varieties and difficulty surpassing foreign varieties, Li led his team step by step.
“Breeding requires time for innovation; without core competitiveness, one will be eliminated by the market, and the team will struggle to continue,” he said. Guided by market demand, he combined academic research with practical application, establishing an enterprise-oriented approach to integrating industry, academia, and research. To accomplish this, he established a research and development (R&D) center to improve industry-research integration.
For nearly a decade, Li and his team traveled across China collecting germplasm resources, covering a distance of over 500,000 kilometers. Through rigorous selection, the team cultivated nearly 100 varieties, with five obtaining new variety patent certificates and gaining market recognition.

Attracted by Yongde’s rich germplasm resources of Chinese roses, suitable climate for the large-scale cultivation of high-quality Chinese roses, and supportive environment for innovation, Li moved and expanded his R&D center and established a company in the county in 2022, focusing on the development of the industry of Rosa odorata, a hybrid flowering plant of the genus Rosa native to Yunnan.
Currently, Li’s team has established a 100 mu (about 6.67 hectares) Chinese rose germplasm resource base in Yongde. It serves as a laboratory for rural revitalization, a gene bank, and a new type of research institution, gathering talents and platforms to build an integrated industrial innovation system with enterprises at the core, driving the development of Lincang’s floral industry and Yongde’s rose sector.
“Among our four R&D centers, the one in Yongde is of crucial significance because it houses over 200,000 breeding materials for Rosa odorata from abroad, including 30 ancient varieties and over 1,000 pieces of germplasm resources of more than 20 wild varieties, many of which are variants unique to Yongde,” Li said.
Li’s presence isn’t only helping to improve the state of roses in Yongde, but also improving the lives of those that live there. Villagers in the area have leased their land to the company, and in return receive rent rates higher than normal. The villagers can also receive training to become workers for the company, allowing them to work near their homes and together grow with the roses on a path to prosperity.

XI'AN, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- A well-preserved giant panda fossil, dating back at least 10,000 years, has been discovered in a cave in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the provincial department of natural resources said on Wednesday.
The department received tips in late July from local residents that suspected animal bone fossils had been discovered in the depth of a cave in Chenggu County, Hanzhong City of Shaanxi.
Following an on-the-ground investigation, researchers have preliminarily determined that the fossil belonged to an adult giant panda, presumably a female one. This finding is based on the fossil's skull morphology, dental structure, and sagittal crest development.
The fossil is estimated to date back to a time between the late Middle Pleistocene and the Late Pleistocene of the Quaternary Period, between 200,000 and 10,000 years ago.
""The panda skeleton we found is over 70 percent complete, making it the most intact of its kind uncovered in the province in recent years,"" said Zeng Zhongcheng, deputy director of the Shaanxi provincial paleontological fossil protection and research center.
It is a significant discovery, said Hu Songmei, a member of the Shaanxi provincial paleontological fossil expert committee, adding that it has helped reveal the survival and evolutionary process of giant pandas that inhabited the junction areas between modern-day Shaanxi and its neighboring provinces. It is also helping map out ancient geography, paleoclimate, and environmental changes during the Pleistocene era.
The fossil bones have been safely transported to Xi'an, the capital city of Shaanxi, ready for specimen restoration and related scientific research.
