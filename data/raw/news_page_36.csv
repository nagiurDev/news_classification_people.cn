Asia's largest and China's first vertical high-altitude simulation test stand for rocket engines has successfully completed an ignition test in Beijing, Global Times learned from the developers on Thursday.
The stand was developed and constructed by the Institute 101 of the Sixth Academy of the state-owned space giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).
The facility can simulate high-altitude conditions for engines in a vacuum environment below one kilopascal and sustain high-altitude simulation tests for thousands of seconds, according to the developers in a statement sent to the Global Times.
The successful ignition test on Wednesday proved that the test stand is fully constructed and operational, filling the gap in China's capability for vertical high-altitude simulation tests of liquid rocket engines. It will provide crucial support for major aerospace projects in China and offer important technical support for the construction of testing conditions for heavy-lift rockets, developers revealed.
The test stand has full active ejection capability throughout the process, with overall comprehensive indicators reaching internationally advanced levels.
It uses advanced super-single-stage ejection technology, significantly enhancing ejection capability, efficiency, and reliability, while reducing equipment scale and operational complexity. A multi-machine parallel system for the steam generator was developed, breaking through high-reliability torch ignition technology and stable start-up technology for extrusion and pump pressure multi-modes. The system has redundancy and real-time fault diagnosis capabilities, providing excellent performance and a wide range of applications.
The test stand project has also marked the largest in scale, most technically challenging, and shortest in construction duration among the test facility construction projects undertaken by the institute.
The institute vowed in the statement that it will make full use of the test stand, constantly elevating China's liquid engine test and technology verification capabilities and making a greater contribution to the country's cause of building into a space power.
Previously, China had successfully conducted a trial run for a high-thrust test stand for liquid-propellant rocket engine in Tongchuan, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province in April 2023, marking the completion of the test bench with a load capacity of 700 tons of thrust, also the largest of its kind in Asia.
Space observers hailed the test and technology verification facility's construction would further support the country's major projects including the development of heavy-lift carrier rockets, manned lunar landings and deep space exploration.
China successfully launched its Chang'e-6 lunar probe in early May, aiming to complete a sampling mission and return from the lunar far side. The mission also marked the first step of the basic construction phase of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS).
Chang'e-7 is scheduled for launch around 2026 to conduct environmental and resource surveys at the lunar south pole; Chang'e-8 is planned for launch around 2028 to conduct in-situ resource utilization experiments on the moon.
By 2035, the basic version will be completed, centered around the lunar south pole, with comprehensive scientific facilities equipped with basic functions and elements, conducting regular scientific experiments and a certain scale of resource development and utilization.
By 2045, the expanded version will be completed, with the lunar orbit station as the hub. Featuring fully equipped and substantially scaled facilities, and stable operations, it will conduct comprehensive scientific research on the moon and in-depth resource development and utilization, as well as conduct technical verification and scientific experiments related to a manned mission to Mars.
Wu Weiren, chief scientist and director of China's Deep Space Exploration Laboratory (DSEL) and an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, also revealed in April that China plans to launch the Tianwen-2 mission around 2025, and to carry out flyby exploration and return samples from a small asteroid located about 40 million kilometers away from Earth. Around 2030, Tianwen-3 is planned to be launched to execute a sample return mission from Mars, Wu said.

With virtual reality (VR) headsets, students at a Hong Kong university can now have lectures on game theory presented by an AI-generated Albert Einstein facilitated by a project led by a research team from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) (Guangzhou). The technology is expected to revolutionize college classrooms.
Including AI-generated Albert Einstein, mathematician and Nobel Prize laureate John Nash and Professor Pan Hui, the project leads for HKUST’s AI project, a total of 10 AI-generated teachers were designed by tools of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) to boost students’ involvement and motives and enrich the teaching forms in classrooms.
Apart from the aforementioned avatars which were designed according to real prototypes, all the other seven AI lecturers were designed from sketch — based on different origins, cultural backgrounds, character settings, and styles, with customized appearance, voices, and gestures. They can be displayed on either screens or VR headsets.
Led by Hui, the chair professor of Computational Media and Arts (CMA) and the Director of the Centre for Metaverse and Computational Creativity at the HKUST (Guangzhou), the research team used multiple AIGC tools including Midjourney, ChatGPT, Bing, as well as the team’s self-developed variational 3D full-body generator and a 3D motion generation system to create smoother avatars’ movements to improve students’ learning experience through natural expressions and movements.
The mass availability of tools such as ChatGPT has sparked optimism about new leaps in teaching and learning, Hui told the Global Times on Thursday, noting that it is a trend that more AI technologies will be integrated into future classroom teaching and students’ performance assessment.
Throughout the semester, the AI lecturers were teaching the course, Social Media for Creatives, which covers a variety of topics including gamification of learning, immersive experiences, and the impact of social media on society.
To understand the impact of AI lecturers on teaching effectiveness, students’ learning motivation, and performance, the team also collected feedback from students after each class. They target to understand how different styles, physical appearances and styles, verbal and non-verbal expression, dimensions (2D/3D), accents, and modes of expression affect the influence of AI lecturers on students in terms of trust, attractiveness, and affinity.
The research team, as a next step, will utilize large-scale language models and introduce the responsive AI lecturers to enhance their interactivity, allowing reply to students’ questions.
According to Hui, the AI lecturers will complement to human lecturers in teaching activities to make some boring topics more interesting, allow teachers to cater for individual education needs and consider the differentiations in learning among students, as well as explore creative teaching modes.
According to Hui, more than 90 percent of his students reflect their welcome to AI lectures whom they think are more absorbing and creditable.
With the introduction of the latest AI chatbot GPT-4o, Hui foreshadowed that AI technologies will bring more revolutions to the teaching and learning practice, as students’ feedback shows their expectations of 24-hour approachable AI digital teachers via different media channels in their mobile phones and laptops.
Besides, Hui said that the digital teachers can perceivably customize teaching for different students based on the students’ strengths and weakness assessed by the AI algorithm.
“With AI technology, teachers’ role will gradually change from a knowledge disseminator into someone like a curator who integrates more elements in teaching activities to train students in critical thinking and creativity,” Hui said.

Feature: Researchers unravel evolutionary history of baobab trees,2024-05-16,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0516/c90000-20170490.html,"Home>>
		
Feature: Researchers unravel evolutionary history of baobab trees
 (Xinhua) 13:37, May 16, 2024
WUHAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A collaborative effort between Chinese and international researchers has shed light on the evolutionary journey of baobab trees, pinpointing Madagascar as the cradle of all baobab species.
Published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, the study, conducted by researchers from the Sino-Africa Joint Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other institutes, represents a significant milestone in terms of better understanding these iconic trees.
Baobabs, a genus with only eight extant species, have their stronghold in Madagascar, where six species exclusively thrive. The other two species are found in lowland areas of the African mainland and the northwestern corner of Australia. Revered due to their cultural and ecological significance, baobab trees are often referred to as ""mothers of the forest"" and ""trees of life"" in Madagascar.
Leveraging high-quality genomic data from all eight extant baobab species, researchers embarked on a journey through time to unravel the evolutionary tapestry of baobabs. Their findings suggested that Madagascar probably served as the cradle of baobab diversification, with a subsequent dispersal to the African mainland and Australia.
Their study also underscored the pivotal role played by factors such as paleogeographic events, animal pollinators, and local sea level fluctuations in sculpting the past population dynamic of Malagasy baobabs.
""What we see concerning baobabs in Madagascar today was greatly influenced by both interspecific competition and the geological history of the island, especially changes in local sea levels,"" said Wan Junnan, the first co-author of the paper and a researcher from the Wuhan Botanical Garden.
The researchers warned that escalating sea levels driven by climate change could impede the natural range expansion of baobabs, potentially exerting adverse effects on their population dynamics.
Armed with a comprehensive understanding of baobab genetics, the researchers hoped to unlock vital clues for the conservation of these trees in the face of rapidly evolving environments.
They underscored the urgent need for conservation efforts, citing the confluence of factors threatening baobab populations, including habitat loss and the decline of key pollinators such as fruit bats and hawkmoths.
Moreover, the researchers advocated for a reassessment of the conservation status of certain baobab species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. This recommendation stemmed from findings which revealed their limited genetic variability, small population sizes, and narrow ecological niches (or habitat preferences), making them vulnerable to climate change and other environmental pressures such as land use changes. According to data projection, some baobab species even face a potential precipitous drop in numbers of at least 90 percent.
Such a drastic potential decline warrants reclassification from endangered to critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for targeted conservation efforts, the study said.
In the future, the researchers intend to expand their sampling efforts regarding baobab trees to advance conservation initiatives and secure greater awareness of their unique attributes.

Fossilized teeth provide new insights into dinosaurs in south China,2024-05-16,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0516/c90000-20170475.html,"Home>>
		
Fossilized teeth provide new insights into dinosaurs in south China
By Yuan Quan (Xinhua) 13:14, May 16, 2024
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Four large dinosaur teeth unearthed in Guangdong Province have been confirmed by Chinese scientists to be from the Tyrannosauroidea group dating back 70 million to 66 million years ago, making it the southernmost fossil evidence of this taxon in China.
The four teeth can be traced back to the Maastrichtian stage, the most recent phase of the Late Cretaceous period. Three of these specimens were discovered in 2010 in the city of Sihui by an amateur fossil enthusiast who later donated them to a local museum. The other tooth was found at a construction site in the provincial capital Guangzhou in 2020 by one researcher and is currently housed in the collection of Sun Yat-sen University.
The three teeth discovered in Sihui were remarkably well-preserved, boasting crowns exceeding 6 cm in length, and the tooth fragment found in Guangzhou is 3.3 cm long. However, all four fossils exhibited similar morphological characteristics, including gently serrated edges and smooth enamel.
These features are consistent with those of Tyrannosauroidea teeth and distinguish them from those observed in other large carnivorous dinosaurs, according to a research article recently published in the international journal Cretaceous Research.
Lead author Xing Lida, an associate professor at China University of Geosciences (Beijing), said that Tyrannosauroidea is a bipedal predatory dinosaur exhibiting significant variations in body size, making it the dominant group during the middle and late Cretaceous period. The Tyrannosaurus rex, measuring over 12 meters in length, represents the largest and most renowned species within the Tyrannosauroidea.
However, compared with other Tyrannosauroidea teeth found in China, the sizes of the four fossils are small.
The research team is facing difficulties in accurately estimating the body lengths of the teeth owners due to the inability to pinpoint the exact locations of the teeth in the mouth.
A conservative estimate suggests that the teeth owners measure at least five to six meters in length, according to Wang Donghao, a member of the research team at China University of Geosciences (Beijing).
The lack of records of large carnivorous dinosaur fossils in south China has been addressed with the fossil teeth discovery, which ""fills a prominent ecological gap for the region and expands the confirmed range of the tyrannosauroids,"" the researchers noted in the study.
Together with previous records of fossilized dinosaur eggs found in the region, the discovery of the teeth also suggests that a variety of dinosaur species thrived in southern China before the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period, Xing said.

Chinese scientists achieve breakthrough in combating plant cancer
 (Xinhua) 16:56, May 15, 2024
TIANJIN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a novel bio-fungicide to combat root rot disease in cultivating Astragalus membranaceus, commonly known as Huangqi or Astragalus root, according to an article published in Chemical Engineering Journal.
The bio-fungicide can suppress the root rot disease and promote the growth metabolism of Astragalus membranaceus, said Gao Wenyuan, a professor at the School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, who led the research team.
Root rot disease is a kind of plant cancer and a common disease in Chinese medicinal herb planting areas, caused by a complex of pathogenic fungi. It poses a significant threat to the cultivation of Astragalus membranaceus.
Mechanistic studies have revealed that this novel bio-fungicide exerts its antifungal effect by inhibiting the growth genes of Fusarium oxysporum, stimulating the production of antifungal compounds in Astragalus membranaceu, and activating its resistance genes.
""This bio-fungicide is as effective as currently available pesticides, but the cost is lower and it is more environmentally friendly,"" Gao said, adding that it holds great potential as an alternative to traditional pesticides and has enormous applications in plant protection.
The researchers plan to further optimize the cost and promote widespread application in the future.

 (Xinhua) 16:20, May 15, 2024
GUIYANG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have discovered a new fish species without functional eyes in a subterranean river within a cave in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
In a paper published in the international journal Zoosystematics and Evolution, Sinocyclocheilus guiyang is described as a pinkish fish that belongs to the genus Sinocyclocheilus. It is named after Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province, where the species was found in 2019.
The fish is blind with its eyes having degenerated into black spots without a complete ocular structure. This is probably a result of the dark environment of its habitat in the underground river, located in a karst cave, said Zhou Jiajun, a co-author of the paper.
The species has an extremely small population, with only 25 individuals having been recorded. Recent surveys have indicated a further decline in their number, said Cheng Guangyuan, the co-author who first discovered the fish.
Researchers have warned that the new species is at high risk of extinction due to pollution from garbage and invasive crayfish species threatening its cavernous habitat, highlighting the need for immediate habitat protection measures.

Chinese scientists map macaque brain networks
 (Xinhua) 10:20, May 15, 2024
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has successfully drawn a novel network map of a macaque brain that will help explain the macroscopic organizational patterns of the human brain.
The map, created by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Automation, divided the macaque brain into 304 distinct regions and quantitatively depicted the anatomical and functional connectivity patterns of each region.
Complex human behavior is driven by different functional networks in the brain. These networks are essentially collections of brain regions that communicate with one another through functional connections.
As macaques are highly similar to humans in terms of genetics, physiology and brain structure, the species is an ideal model for the study of the mechanisms of human cognitive function and can be used in the simulation of human brain diseases, said Jiang Tianzi, a researcher at the institute.
The panoramic brain map expressing the spatial organization of the macaque brain is an important research result as it can be translated for the study of the human brain, Jiang said.
It aids our understanding of brain function and will advance important research fields such as translational medicine, cross-species comparison and the digital modeling of the brain.

China New Growth: Transformative AI makes Chinese automobiles smarter,2024-05-14,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0514/c90000-20169600.html,"Home>>
		
China New Growth: Transformative AI makes Chinese automobiles smarter
 (Xinhua) 16:55, May 14, 2024
SHANGHAI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Settling into the plush comfort of his vehicle cockpit, a driver surnamed Liu spoke to the sleek dashboard display: ""Simo, how long before I reach home?""
""You have an hour's journey ahead,"" answered the onboard intelligence system supported by the large language model (LLM), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered program that can recognize and generate multimedia text.
""Please activate the home air conditioning and close the curtains 30 minutes prior to my arrival."" ""Affirmative.""
This scenario unfolded within Jiyue, an intelligent vehicle backed by Geely Auto, a prominent Chinese automaker, in collaboration with Yiyan, Baidu's LLM platform.
Despite the complexity of overlapping voices, simultaneous commands or ongoing conversations, the smart voice system can adeptly discern and address the unique requirements of the commander.
Its adoption rate has reached an impressive 98 percent among its car owners, who on average utilize the system more than 60 times daily, said Xia Yiping, CEO of Jiyue Auto.
""See it, say it, and get it done."" Achieving this level of sophistication for smart cockpits is the goal of China's automotive industry.
China's competitive edge in the automotive market is not just a result of its burgeoning new energy vehicle (NEV) sector. The swift progression in the smart capabilities of these vehicles is equally pivotal in securing this advantage.
The country is committed to fortifying and elevating its vanguard status in the sector of intelligently-connected and new energy vehicles, according to this year's government work report.
China's auto landscape is now enriched with the integration of large-scale AI models, a collaborative effort between leading technology firms and automotive manufacturers.
Prominent tech firms contributed models like Huawei's PanGu, Baidu's Yiyan and iFlytek's Xinghuo. Carmakers also made strides with their own proprietary architectures, including BYD's Xuanji and XPeng's Lingxi.
Now, over ten Chinese vehicle brands have embraced this technological leap, incorporating advanced AI models into their lineup.
""Cars, serving as a terminal that harnesses a plethora of cutting-edge technologies, have evolved from electrification to intelligence, and are poised to seamlessly integrate with the broader transport infrastructure in the future,"" said Fang Yunzhou, the founder of Hozon Auto, a Chinese electric car startup.
Previously, drivers were required to issue direct commands to their voice assistants, like ""activate the air conditioning."" But now, with the incorporation of an advanced AI model, a simple statement such as ""I'm feeling a bit chilly"" suffices.
The sophisticated AI, demonstrating an understanding reminiscent of human cognition, can respond to the driver's needs by executing a sequence of actions. This includes closing the windows, tuning the air conditioning to the driver's accustomed temperature, and adjusting the fan to their usual setting.
""In the past, the process of voice recognition involved data analysis in the cloud followed by a download to the vehicle,"" said Xia. ""Now, the task can be done offline, a transition that allows drivers to operate their vehicles seamlessly even in the absence of an internet connection.""
""The AI was predominantly governed by explicit rules, while contemporary large-scale models are propelled by data,"" said Zhong Xinlong, an AI expert at CCID consulting, a think tank under China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
""This is akin to the concept of learning from specific examples and then applying that knowledge broadly, a skill that mirrors human learning and application of knowledge,"" Zhong added.
Intelligence in automobiles is not confined to smart cockpits. Chinese automakers have taken a significant step forward by integrating the AI model across the entire spectrum of vehicle intelligence to achieve a comprehensive and vertical alignment of applications in multiple scenarios.
""Large-scale AI models are far more intelligent in perception, behavior and control than we might imagine, as they can, for example, interpret signs such as 'ETC ahead is about to be repaired, please change lanes',"" said He Xiaopeng, XPeng chairman and CEO.
XPeng's intelligent driving system, which once received updates on a quarterly basis, has seen an average of 3.87 new updates being rolled out daily, according to He.
""The integration of large-scale AI models into vehicles has already brought about a transformation from zero to one,"" said Fang.
""Looking ahead, the evolution will be exponential. As this technology matures, we anticipate a future where the responsibility of driving is progressively handed over to the vehicle's autonomous systems,"" Fang added.

Aerospace technologies serve as a mirror of a country's sci-tech capabilities and overall national strength, while also propelling the development of related high-tech industries.
Today, China's aerospace industry has become a new driver for economic and social development, with the technological achievements being rapidly applied for the public good.
One afternoon, Guo Yufei, a researcher with the Intelligence Technology Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), was testing a camera developed by his team.
""Traditional cameras are limited by exposure synchronization technology, often resulting in unclear imaging when capturing scenes with varying levels of brightness,"" Guo said.
As he pointed the camera towards the sun outside the window, a display next to him immediately showed a clear and sharp image.
Equipped with a neuromorphic sensor, the camera could capture images with ""asynchronous"" exposure just like human eyes to precisely render scenes with significant variations in brightness.
Guo told People's Daily that this technology was initially employed in space observation and other aerospace fields, but it is now finding applications in everyday scenarios such as smartphone photography and smart driving.

In recent years, over 4,000 items of achievements obtained through China's space program have been used in such industries as biology, medicine, agriculture, and natural resources in Beijing, bringing aerospace technologies closer to the daily lives of the people.
A vehicle-road-cloud collaborative automated driving system, developed by the Intelligence Technology Academy of CASIC through long-term research, is now operational in the Wuhu Comprehensive Bonded Zone, east China's Anhui province. It connects all the self-driving shuttle buses that run along the 7.2-km-long loop road, providing commuting services for more than 100 employees of the bonded zone.
""It used to take about 25 minutes to walk from the subway station to the office building, but with the unmanned shuttle buses, the commuting time is reduced to just eight minutes,"" said Jiang Fan, a researcher with the Intelligence Technology Academy of CASIC.
""Apart from high precision, the smart driving system is also safe, efficient, and operates around the clock,"" Jiang added.
In Gangwan village, Huangpi district of Wuhan, central China's Hubei province, driverless rotary tillers were working in the paddy fields of Yongwang agricultural cooperative, neatly turning over the soil ridges.
Tao Zhe, an operator of intelligent farm machinery, was controlling these driverless rotary tillers using a phone app enabled by the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). According to Tao, these tillers were all equipped with the BDS, ensuring precise operation along the routes.
The BDS technology has made work easier for Yongwang agricultural cooperative, from planting to management, and to harvesting.

""We have installed sensors in different parts of the paddy fields and use 5G, BDS, Internet of Things, and cloud computing to monitor real-time data on pH, temperature, wind speed, and other factors for each plot,"" said Hu Dan, head of the cooperative.
Compared to traditional production methods, the digital agricultural production model enabled by technologies such as the BDS can save more than 90 percent of manual labor in farm management, Hu explained.
In recent years, Hubei province has been accelerating the adoption of the BDS technology in the agricultural sector. As of now, more than 40,000 sets of BDS-enabled agricultural machinery terminals have been installed in the province, covering a total operating area of 112 million mu (approximately 7.47 million hectares).
Apart from agriculture, Hubei province has extensively applied the BDS technology in electricity, water conservancy, and transportation sectors.
In Fujiayan township, Wufeng Tujia autonomous county, Yichang, Hubei province, Xu Haizhang, a team leader with the Ultra High Voltage Company of State Grid Hubei Electric Power Co., Ltd., was skillfully maneuvering a drone with a remote control to fly it steadily along the power lines.
""Most of the power lines under our management are located in mountainous areas, where network signals were often unavailable. In the past, even though we had patrol drones, they often couldn't take off,"" Xu said.
""Now, with the BDS-enabled drones, we enjoy centimeter-level real-time precision positioning services and have achieved accurate perception in all weather conditions and without blind spots,"" he added.

JINAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A diverse array of over 600 new vegetable varieties, including cucumbers, tomatoes, chilies, purple peppers and eggplants, are currently showcased at the 25th China (Shouguang) International Vegetable Sci-Tech Fair in the city of Shouguang in east China's Shandong Province.
Many of these varieties have already hit the market and are available to ordinary consumers, as China's advancements in vegetable technology are expanding the culinary horizons, offering more options for dining tables everywhere.
One particular highlight at the fair is a variety of ""slimming cucumbers,"" which has garnered significant attention. ""It contains several times more propanol diacid than ordinary varieties, which helps inhibit the conversion of sugar into fat, and is thus called 'slimming cucumber',"" said Xu Tiemin, deputy mayor of Shouguang and deputy director of the Shouguang vegetable research &development center, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
Shouguang, one of China's major vegetable production bases, has cultivated over 1,000 mu (about 66.7 hectares) of the new cucumber variety, with a yield of 10 tonnes per mu, according to Xu.
Over the past four decades, China has cultivated over 6,500 vegetable varieties, with many fine varieties undergoing four to five generations of upgrades, according to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
In Shouguang, the proportion of domestic vegetable seeds has increased to over 70 percent from 54 percent in 2010. ""At present, solanum varieties cultivated in Shouguang are ahead of the international level in many aspects such as yield, taste, disease resistance, and cold hardiness,"" said Liu Xinqing, president of Shandong Shouguang Vegetable Seed Industry Group.
The ongoing sci-tech fair also features more than 80 vegetable planting models and over 100 technologies, including rotary farming, tidal farming, aquaponics systems, vertical farming and space breeding.
In one exhibition hall, tomato plants are displayed growing with their roots exposed to the air, devoid of contact with water or soil. Sprayers atomize a nutrient solution, which is then directly sprayed onto the roots.
""Compared with traditional soil cultivation, aerosol planting can be more easily applied in vertical farming with automatic operations, which helps to reduce the incidence of diseases and pests while maximizing greenhouse space utilization,"" said Ma Zunjuan, an exhibition hall worker at the fair.
In the same hall, several robots can be spotted moving back and forth in tomato fields. ""They are pollinating the flowers with the help of technologies such as visual recognition and positioning and multi-sensor integrated navigation,"" Ma explained.
In China, the extensive application of digital technologies in agriculture is helping transform and upgrade agricultural production, injecting new momentum into the modernization of farming and the countryside.
In Shouguang, digital technologies and intelligent equipment are widely used in vegetable greenhouses, with the application rate of the Internet of Things in new greenhouses exceeding 80 percent.

Engineers develop soft drone grippers inspired by climbing plants,2024-05-13,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0513/c90000-20169017.html,"Home>>
		
Engineers develop soft drone grippers inspired by climbing plants
 (Xinhua) 15:02, May 13, 2024
HANGZHOU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese engineers has developed a new class of biomimetic soft drone grippers that allow unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform a variety of tasks, such as retrieving a key hanging from a tree branch or snatching branches from moving water.
Aerial transportation and manipulation extend the capabilities of UAVs, but the rigid grippers they use tend to be heavy, have a single grasping mode, and are limited in terms of the shape and size of the object that can be grasped.
Tendril plants are often characterized as having exceptional grapnels, possessing the remarkable ability to tightly clutch onto branches with their entangled, soft and grasping forms. Also, there is another category of climbing plants that have evolved with hook-like structures that enable them to scale the vertical surfaces of tall buildings.
Researchers from Zhejiang University drew inspiration from such climbing plants and designed two U-shaped, eccentric circular tube actuators. The U-shaped bending ability of these actuators allows UAVs to grasp objects by using a hook or a vine-like rope.
Based on these two types of actuators, researchers then proceeded to construct two types of soft grippers, thereby forming self-contained systems that can be directly driven by voltage.
The gripper inspired by soft tendril climbers is designed for delicate grasping, while the one inspired by hook climbers can be used for tasks requiring strong grasping, according to a study published as a cover story in the latest edition of the journal Science Advances.
The load capacity for a single actuator with hook structures is about 29 percent more compared to one without such a hook, and it can grasp a maximum weight of approximately 450 grams, according to the study.
This type of gripper mounted on a drone demonstrated its capabilities by successfully grasping common household items like plastic bottles, glass goblets, clamps and ceramic ornaments.
In an outdoor experiment, a drone flew towards a key suspended from a tree limb. Its self-adaptive gripper passed through tree limbs and then managed to firmly grasp the key via a voltage that was applied to the resistance wires.
This UAV grasping solution can be useful in environmental protection, where it can be deployed for tasks such as gathering trash in the wild and removing garbage from rivers and lakes. In freshwater ecosystems, manual collection currently remains the main method of garbage cleanup, which means it is labor-intensive.
In another outdoor experiment, the research team used a UAV to salvage a branch suspended in a lake. A drone flew to a specific lake area and immersed the gripper in the lake. The U-shaped elongated gripper then demonstrated its effectiveness by successfully hooking the branch, while its self-contained system steadily supplied gas underwater, resulting in a secure and firm grasp on the object. Finally, the drone ascended and returned to shore.
Unlike rigid grippers, the soft and adaptable gripper can absorb vibrations transmitted by UAVs and also allows an object to rotate or move within the gripper.
Outdoor applications have highlighted the unique advantages of the soft grippers across a spectrum of challenging environments. Such grippers can operate effectively even in cases of low positioning accuracy, reducing the need for complex planning concerning grasping execution, according to the researchers.
The researchers added that soft grippers have proven that they can be used for efficient UAV transportation by winding around or hooking objects with manual assistance in challenging transportation terrain, such as steep mountain slopes.
