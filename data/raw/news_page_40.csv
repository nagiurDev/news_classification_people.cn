Can plants grow without soil and sunshine? The answer might be found in a ""plant factory"" at the Chengdu National Modern Agricultural Industry Science and Technology Innovation Center in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan province.
In the plant factory, lettuce plants grow on multi-tier steel racks, bathing the red and blue rays emitted from LED lights fitted at the top of the racks. The factory, with a pinkish glow coming out of its glass walls, exactly resembles a scene in a sci-fi movie.
""Vegetable growing has its 'production line,' too. A lettuce can mature in just 35 days after the seed is sown if it's provided with proper nutrients, lighting and temperature. It would take at least twice as long in an open field,"" said Yang Qichang, pointing to the 20-tier facility.
As the chief scientist of the Institute of Urban Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yang and his team have been dedicated to the plant factory for nearly 20 years.
The plant factory runs this way. A computer commands robotic arms to plant lettuce seedlings onto plates, and then the plates are sent to designated tiers of the racks, where the seedlings receive lighting and nutrient solutions. When the lettuce plants mature, they are withdrawn from the racks and packed after their roots are cut off. Thanks to intelligent management and assistive robots, the plant factory is completely unattended, from seeding to harvesting, and to packing.

Traditional agriculture often faces reduced yields due to meteorological disasters, pests and plant diseases. It's always difficult to maintain a sound environment for crops. Greenhouse cultivation is an exploration that allows for the cultivation of off-season vegetables, but it is still susceptible to adverse weather conditions such as high temperatures and snow.
Plant factories have shattered the constraints of natural conditions. As an efficient agricultural system that achieves year-round continuous crop production through precise control in a closed environment, a plant factory can adjust environmental factors such as light, temperature, humidity, and nutrients in real-time according to the specific requirements of different crops. This precise supply enables high-efficiency production.
Additionally, plant factories can induce flowering and promote rapid growth, significantly shortening crops' growth cycle.
Plant factories feature accelerated growth of crops, said Wang Sen, a researcher with the Institute of Urban Agriculture. This type of facility, which is free from the limitations by land, space, and climate conditions, accelerates the growth of crops through a light-nutrient coupling technique. It can shorten the growth period of crops such as rice, wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, and rapeseed by more than half, providing effective support for accelerating crop breeding.
It's important to improve lighting efficiency and lower energy consumption when building a plant factory. Wang told People's Daily that his team has established a database containing 1,238 ""lighting solutions"" for 72 crop varieties in five major categories, which helps adjust lighting plans based on crop varieties and stages of growth.

Besides, with the application of the light-temperature coupling technology, the plant factory's overall energy consumption has been lowered by over 56 percent.
To address the issues of low land utilization and spatial efficiency in traditional flat planting, the team adopted vertical cultivation techniques. ""This 20-tier vertical farm can increase land utilization by over 120 times,"" Yang disclosed.
Today, the 200-square-meter plant factory produces over 60 tons of vegetables each year. By adopting self-developed new crop varieties, vertical cultivation systems, automatic nutrient solution supply systems, energy-saving artificial light sources, and AI-based intelligent management systems, the vertical farm has achieved year-round stable food production.
The team is currently exploring profitable business models for the plant factory. It is learned that the high-end leafy vegetables grown in the plant factory target densely populated urban areas such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze River Delta, as well as regions with a local vegetable self-sufficiency rate below 10 percent. Furthermore, the plant factory can also be used for intensive seedling cultivation, which not only reduces production costs but also ensures seedling quality.
China's plant factories are going international. During an international plant factory technology training program hosted by China, students from over 20 countries received systematic training on plant factories. LED ""lighting solutions"" have been promoted in more than 100 countries and regions. China has also reached agreements with the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Chile and Qatar to build vertical plant factories.

A 130-ton pump rear swing liquid oxygen kerosene engine, developed by the Sixth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC), has completed the largest thrust and most complex ignition test in the history of China's liquid power development on Sunday, with a total thrust of over 500 tons.
This is the first time that the large thrust liquid oxygen kerosene engine used the four-engine parallel ignition test. By combining four technologically mature engine machines together, it not only carries out a comprehensive test of itself, but also lays a solid foundation for the first flight of the new rocket this year.
The four-engine parallel ignition test is not simply a matter of bundling four machines together. It can also provide larger thrust for the rocket and reduce the complexity of the system to a certain extent.
The pump rear swing engine is a kind of engine with the swinging device rear-mounted, which can effectively reduce both the engine work space and the weight of the engine structure. Compared with the existing 120-ton liquid oxygen kerosene engine, the pump rear swing engine has larger thrust, higher performance and more compact structure. More engines can be laid out in the same rocket diameter, effectively improving the rocket carrying capacity.
Li Bin, vice president in charge of the Sixth Academy and chief engineer of the liquid oxygen kerosene engine, said the successful run of the four-engine parallel test has verified the coordination of the pump rear swing engine's multi-machine work and the reliability of the work under the maximum force and heat environment, proving that the engine is fully equipped with the conditions for the flight application.
The engine will be processed after testing and will be delivered for flight applications.
In a statement the CASC provided to the Global Times, the space giant has vowed to prioritize in 2024 the development of cost-efficient solid rocket engines, YF-102 series liquid rocket engines and YF-209 liquid oxygen methane reusable engines, in order to meet the urgent demand in the commercial market.

China releases world's first high-definition lunar geologic atlas,2024-04-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0429/c90000-20163198.html,"Home>>
		
China releases world's first high-definition lunar geologic atlas
By Wu Yuehui (People's Daily) 13:20, April 29, 2024
The first complete high-definition lunar geologic atlas in the world was released in Beijing on April 21. The atlas was drawn by a Chinese scientific research team mainly based on scientific exploration data from the Chang'e Project. With a scale of 1:2.5 million, it is the world's most precise geological atlas of the whole moon.
This geologic atlas set, available in both Chinese and English, includes the Geologic Atlas of the Lunar Globe and the Map Quadrangles of the Geologic Atlas of the Moon. In particular, the Geologic Atlas of the Lunar Globe consists of the Geologic Map of the Moon, the Lithologic Map of the Moon and the Tectonic Map of the Moon. The Map Quadrangles of the Geologic Atlas of the Moon includes 30 standardized sub-schematic geological maps of the moon.

The world has been using the lunar geologic maps obtained by the Apollo program, but these maps can no longer meet the current and future needs of deep space exploration and scientific research.
Since 2012, academician Ouyang Ziyuan and researcher Liu Jianzhong of the Institute of Geochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), have led a team of scientists and cartographers from relevant research institutions in compiling a new-generation lunar geologic atlas set, including Jilin University, Shandong University, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), the Institute of Geology of Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, and the CAS Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research.
With a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the origin and evolution of the moon, the team compiled the atlas based on scientific exploration data gained from China's Chang'e lunar exploration program and other research results from both Chinese and international missions, Liu said.
By studying and collecting elements such as lunar rock formation, geological structure, and characteristics of the moon in different ages, China made technical specifications and standards of lunar geologic mapping with independent intellectual property rights, and compiled the 1:2.5 million digital lunar geologic atlas set.
A total of 12,341 impact craters, 81 impact basins, 17 types of lithologies and 14 types of structures all over the moon are mapped in the atlas.
A unified classification system for the sub-types of basin formations has been established. Besides, some special elements including landing sites of human probes and points of special elevation are also shown in the atlas.
The atlas set has been integrated into the digital lunar cloud platform built by Chinese scientists, and will serve lunar scientific research and science education, as well as landing site selection, lunar resource exploration and path planning for China's future lunar exploration projects.

China completes ignition test for powerful liquid-propellant engine
 (Xinhua) 11:05, April 29, 2024
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully completed an ignition test for its liquid-propellant engine with the highest thrust, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).
This marks a new breakthrough in the country's liquid propulsion development. It is also the first-ever parallel ignition test of four large-thrust liquid oxygen (LOX) kerosene engines.
The 130-tonne class LOX kerosene engine, developed by the CASC, has a total thrust of over 500 tonnes. Compared to the currently operational 120-tonne class LOX kerosene engines, it not only boasts a larger thrust and better performance, but also a more compact structure, effectively enhancing the rocket's carrying capacity.
The parallel ignition test refers to the integration of four mature engine systems, working in unison rather than simply being bundled together. This approach provides a larger thrust for the rocket while also reducing the overall complexity of the system.
The successful trial run validates the coordination of multiple engines and their reliability in high thermal environments, demonstrating that the engines are fully capable of flight applications.

Digitalization drive helps advance modernization of social governance in Chongqing,2024-04-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0429/c90000-20163149.html,"Home>>
		
Digitalization drive helps advance modernization of social governance in Chongqing
By Li Zenghui, Jiang Feng, Chang Biluo (People's Daily) 10:48, April 29, 2024
In the office building of the Chongqing Ecology and Environment Bureau, a water monitoring and control system flashed red, signaling excessive phosphorus concentration at a river section.
By tracing data from the sensors network, the system narrowed down the investigation area and pinpointed several upstream industrial enterprises as potential sources of contamination.

Inspection teams from local environmental protection agencies and other relevant departments were immediately dispatched to the identified sites. After their intervention, water quality returned to the normal level.
This rapid response was made possible by Chongqing's efforts to advance digitalization.
The water monitoring and control system integrates data from over 10 municipal departments in agriculture, water resources, housing and urban-rural development sectors, as well as districts and counties in Chongqing.
The system's sensing network has expanded from the original 1,112 sensors to over 15,000, allowing issues to be detected within 24 hours on average, down from 7 days previously.
In April 2023, Chongqing initiated a comprehensive digital transformation program known as ""Digital Chongqing."" This involved establishing an integrated intelligent public data platform, a three-tier digital urban operation and governance center, six major application systems, and an intelligent governance framework.

The program aimed at infusing digital technologies and digital cognition into every aspect of city management and service delivery, restructuring operational systems, business processes and institutional mechanisms across various sectors, and modernizing social governance.
Recently, the digital urban operation and governance center in Chongqing's Jiulongpo district received an alert: a dump truck with unsecured load was identified by video surveillance while crossing into another district's jurisdiction in violation of regulations.
Through a location tracking system, the vehicle's position and originating construction site were quickly pinpointed. With a single click, a task order was dispatched to relevant authorities. The detection to resolution of the entire illegal dump truck incident took less than 3 hours.
In advancing digitalization, Chongqing has worked to break down information barriers between government departments.
""Based on the data collected from government departments related to housing, urban management and transportation, we developed a dump truck monitoring system, which had been promoted city-wide to solve monitoring challenges,"" said Zhang Jun, deputy director of Jiulongpo district's big data application and development management bureau.

Chongqing also pursues targeted governance while promoting digitalization. For instance, the Xianglushan neighborhood of Chongqing High-tech Industrial Development Zone installed smart door sensors for elderly residents living alone and connected them to its governance command center. In Baochengsi community of Changzhou neighborhood, Rongchang district, an intelligent elderly care system is in place to serve senior citizens in need.
Over 1,000 townships and neighborhoods in Chongqing have established the integrated three-tier digital governance network, which seamlessly connects the township and neighborhood level, the village and community level, and finally down to individual grid unit areas.
Chongqing has made 65,000 digital grid-level holographic maps that facilitate end-to-end task allocation and case management. As a result, the resolution rate for issues reported at the grid level has reached 99.9 percent.
Digitalization has made public services more efficient. To better address public concerns, the Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau launched an online service platform. The platform offers over 430 online services, and over 80 percent of them need no offline procedures at all. Since the platform was launched in January 2021, it has processed over 100 million service requests.
Since April 2023, Chongqing rolled out 75 ""one-stop"" service packages citywide, covering high-frequency domains and key services closely related to production and daily lives of businesses and citizens, such as one-stop business registration and one-stop birth registration.

Brain-machine integration spawns global biz race

A visitor shakes hands with a staff member equipped with bionic hands enabled by brain-computer interface during an expo in Shanghai. FANG ZHE/XINHUA
In Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, a 38-year-old tech firm worker, who was dealt a cruel hand by life in the form of a car accident that took both his arms, is realizing life could also create marvels, by way of high-tech — in his case, an intelligent bionic hand that breathed new life into his residual limb. Using his mind, he controls the movement of his artificial fingers, grips and dips a brush into ink and elegantly inscribes four Chinese characters on a piece of paper.
The four Chinese characters mean luck and hope — many people would agree with the techie. The brain-computer interface, or BCI, technology, which controls the brain through mind and blurs the lines between humans and machines, promises technological innovation where the mind knows no bounds.
China, propelled by both the government and the private sector, is off the blocks in the global BCI race, trailing only the United States in certain segments. Chinese BCI firms are sharpening focus on both invasive and noninvasive niches of the emerging industry while the authorities concerned are seeking to get a grip on the formulation of regulatory rules.
The bionic hand was developed by BrainCo, a startup incubated at Harvard University and founded by Chinese engineer Han Bicheng. It was previously used by para-athlete Xu Jialing, the torch-bearer at the opening ceremony of the 4th Asian Para Games in Hangzhou last year.
BrainCo uses BCI technology in its bionic arm and couples it with a bracelet-like array of electrode sensors on one's arm, enabling users to use their mind to interpret electromyographic neural signals and next execute actions like clenching fists, opening palms or even giving a thumbs-up.
More than 100 Chinese companies like BrainCo are seeking to excel in the BCI industry. According to a report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank, the trend in China is similar to the one in the US.
The US and China together accounted for two-thirds of the total 500 representative BCI companies in the world as of the end of the first quarter, meaning that both countries have a ""sound foundation"" for leading the industry in the future, the report said.
Another report from the China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute stated that the sales revenue of the global BCI market is expected to reach $3.7 billion by 2027. By 2040, the corresponding figure for China's BCI industry is expected to exceed 120 billion yuan ($16.9 billion), including sales of related equipment, which are expected to exceed 50 billion yuan.
Gao Xiaorong, a tenured professor at Tsinghua University, said: ""The ultimate goal of BCI development is to realize full integration of human brain and machine as one organic whole. As both China and the US are striving to drive progress in the BCI technology, the goal is likely to be achieved over the next 50 years.""
Hexi Yujin, partner and senior vice-president of BrainCo, said: ""It is such technological innovation that propels industrial innovation, thus ultimately transforming into new quality productive forces for the industry.""
She said BrainCo has developed a series of BCI technology applications, including bionic hands, sleep aids and stress relievers that promote mindfulness, which have all entered mass production.
 
""We are the first in the industry to achieve mass production of BCI products, with over 100,000 units of high-precision single-item brain-machine interfaces, which means we are able to control the cost of such frontier technology and make it more accessible.""
At the Zhongguancun Forum, a tech event in Beijing last week, the national capital released an action plan on BCI and proposed a series of targeted measures that aim to drive the development of the BCI industry.
BCI has also been listed as one of China's top 10 iconic products of future-oriented industries in an opinion-based list compiled by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and six other ministries last year.
The list made it clear that accelerated efforts will be made for breakthroughs in BCI, to develop key technologies and core devices such as BCI chips and neural models, a number of easy-to-use and safe BCI products, and encourage exploration of applications in fields such as medical rehabilitation, driverless driving and virtual reality.
In February, a Chinese clinical team from Xuanwu Hospital implanted a wireless processor into the brain of a paralyzed man. This helped him to recover his motor skills. Now, he can drink a bottle of water on his own — one of his many abilities that have been restored.
Zhao Guoguang, a professor at Xuanwu Hospital, said the move marked an important step for China on BCI applications, which will hopefully help patients with brain diseases related to spinal cord injury and epilepsy to recover, and offers the possibility of realizing the fusion of brain-computer intelligence.
The patient, who received the implant in a clinical trial in October 2023, had suffered a complete spinal cord injury in a car mishap. He had been a quadriplegic, or paralyzed in all four limbs, for 14 years.
After three months of home training, the patient is now capable of fetching a bottle of water on his own via an air-filled glove driven by brain waves, with his grasping accuracy rate exceeding 90 percent.
The implantable device, called Neural Electronic Opportunity, was developed by a group of scientists from Tsinghua University. Its internal part is powered by the external part through the scalp, and it receives neural signals before transmitting them to a computer or cellphone.
 

A visitor tried a brain-computer interface device during the China International Fair for Trade in Services in Beijing last year. LI XIN/XINHUA
Zhao, however, also admitted, ""There is still a certain way to go for BCI's large-scale application in the country, and future research will be conducted on device stability and functionality.""
Gao from Tsinghua University said: ""The current Chinese market is dominated by noninvasive BCI companies, accounting for more than 85 percent, involving education, entertainment and other industries, while invasive brain-computer interface devices are mainly in the medical industry. The US counterparts are more advanced in invasive ones.""
In invasive BCI, the sensors are implanted inside the brain in order to increase the information that is being extracted. In contrast, noninvasive BCI is relatively safer and easy to implement but has limited capacity in replacing or enhancing the lost bodily functions, Gao said.
Earlier this year, preeminent entrepreneur Elon Musk said his firm Neuralink had implanted a device in a human for the first time, with the patient recovering well and showing promising neuron spike detection, which sent ripples through the industry.
The move followed Neuralink's announcement in May last year that the US Food and Drug Administration had given the green light to the world's first in-human clinical trial — a huge step forward in BCI development.
But the way forward and the race to the future have to be tempered with caution, said He Jianghong, a renowned expert in neurosurgery at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Safety issues should be given special attention during the BCI technology's development, he said.
""Attention should be paid to track whether a BCI device can be safely put into operation and become compatible for a long time, and whether it will cause direct damage such as infections, bleeding or other problems to users.
""Also, once this technology is widely applied, it will inevitably collect data like a large number of human brain signals, thus potentially raising privacy concerns.""
So, it is important that China and other countries should address ethical issues and take precautions so that the BCI industry can develop in a healthy way, He said.

Chinese scientists find untapped pharmaceutical resources in deep sea
 (Xinhua) 09:42, April 29, 2024
FUZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese marine scientists have identified a plethora of previously unknown microbial natural products from the deep sea floor that may have pharmaceutical applications.
In the cold seeps of the deep sea, microbial communities thrive on the geological seepage of hydrocarbons and inorganic compounds for sustenance, in stark contrast to the sunlight-dependent ecosystems that people are more familiar with on the surface.
These organisms utilize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to synthesize natural products that help them contend for resources. These unknown natural products are believed to possess potent anti-microbial properties, which could be a game-changer in the fight against drug-resistant infections.
The team of scientists, led by researchers from the Third Institute of Oceanography under the Ministry of Natural Resources, have analyzed 22 sediment cores from nine cold seeps, and detected natural product-encoding BGCs from 63 archaeal and bacterial phyla.
A large proportion of the BGCs they discovered are likely to encode antimicrobial compounds, serving as chemical weapons for host defense and competition within the microbial community, according to the study published recently in the journal Science Advances.
The findings provide a pathway to identify previously unrecognized antimicrobial compounds and other types of drugs, according to the researchers.

China's Shenzhou-17 astronauts complete handover, returning to Earth on April 30
 (Xinhua) 16:29, April 28, 2024
JIUQUAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Shenzhou-17 crew held a handover ceremony with the Shenzhou-18 crew and transferred the keys of the country's space station to the latter on Sunday.
Up to now, the Shenzhou-17 crew has completed all planned tasks. The three astronauts will return to the Dongfeng landing site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on April 30, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
At present, the landing site and all participating systems are making final preparations to welcome the astronauts back.
The Shenzhou-17 crew members, consisting of Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin, were launched to the Tiangong space station last October, and have remained in orbit for about half a year.
China launched the Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship on April 25, sending three astronauts -- Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu -- to its space station for another six-month mission.

China embraces AI boom, diverse application scenarios
 (Xinhua) 15:04, April 28, 2024
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Wearing a pink hairpin, white T-shirt and pink shorts, a ""girl"" who looks three or four years old has grabbed the spotlight at the exhibition of the ongoing 2024 Zhongguancun Forum in Beijing.
The ""girl,"" named Tong Tong, or Little Girl in English, is an advanced virtual artificial intelligence (AI) avatar based on artificial general intelligence, according to Zhu Songchun, director of the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, the developer of the product.
In a video demonstration, after being programmed to a preference for liking things tidy, Tong Tong independently fetched a towel to mop up spilled milk when she noticed it on the table -- the behavior came from her autonomous decision made based on a guide of value, rather than a pre-set program.
""Unlike the conventional AI, she can understand your words, interpret your intentions and proactively offer assistance,"" said Zhu, adding that Tong Tong is expected to be applied in various scenarios and empower industries covering six fields, including emergency, transportation, education and healthcare sectors.
Boasting plentiful AI innovations like Tong Tong, China has seen its AI industry in the fast lane. According to data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the total scale of China's core AI industry has reached 500 billion yuan (about 70.37 billion U.S. dollars), and the number of related enterprises has exceeded 4,400.
Featuring diverse application scenarios, AI technology has been permeating every aspect of society.
In the realm of autonomous driving, driverless vehicles with AI technology can automatically choose the optimal route, maintain a proper speed and smoothly pass through complex road sections. In the medical sector, surgical robots equipped with AI systems can help increase the precision and accuracy of the operation, which contributes to reducing post-surgery pain and shortening hospital stays.

Chinese researchers develop high-energy-density aqueous battery,2024-04-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0428/c90000-20162713.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers develop high-energy-density aqueous battery
 (Xinhua) 10:48, April 28, 2024
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has developed a high-energy-density aqueous battery based on halogen multielectron transfer, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
Traditional non-aqueous lithium-ion batteries have a high energy density, but their safety is compromised due to the flammable organic electrolytes they utilize.
Aqueous batteries use water as the solvent for electrolytes, significantly enhancing battery safety. However, due to the limited solubility of the electrolyte and low battery voltage, aqueous batteries usually have a lower energy density. This means that the amount of electricity stored per unit volume of an aqueous battery is relatively low.
In a new study published in the journal Nature Energy, a research team led by Li Xianfeng from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the CAS, in collaboration with Fu Qiang's team, also from the DICP, developed a multielectron transfer cathode based on bromine and iodine, realizing a specific capacity of more than 840 ampere-hour per liter.
To improve the energy density of aqueous batteries, researchers used a mixed halogen solution of iodide ions and bromide ions as the electrolyte. They developed a multielectron transfer reaction, which transfers electrons from iodide ions to elemental iodine and then to iodate.
Combining the cathode with metallic cadmium to form a full battery, the researchers achieved an energy density of up to 1,200 watt hour per liter based on the catholyte.
In the study, the bromide intermediate formed during the charging and discharging process optimized the reaction, effectively improving the kinetics and reversibility of the electrochemical reaction.
This study provides a new direction for the design of high-energy-density aqueous batteries, and may expand aqueous battery applications in the power battery field, Li said.

LANZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Ma Yingbo, 12, had been a space enthusiast for several years, before finally achieving something rare among his peers -- attending a real rocket launch on-site.
Ma is a sixth-grade primary school student from Jishishan, a county in northwest China's Gansu Province, which was struck by a 6.2-magnitude earthquake last December.
Observing the launch of the Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship on Thursday night was part of a space-themed scientific education excursion at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, which was organized by the National Work Committee of the Chinese Young Pioneers.
Pupils from Gansu, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Beijing attending the five-day event also got to participate in space science courses, and had the opportunity to communicate face-to-face with taikonauts.
Ma traveled by both bus and train and his journey had lasted more than 24 hours before he finally arrived at the launch center. Once there, he actively participated in space science courses.
Ma offered Xinhua a glimpse of his learning journal, in which he wrote down his feelings about rockets and the rocket launch. He sees rockets as bridges connecting Earth and space, thereby making ancient myths more accessible and tangible.
On the day of the rocket launch, Ma and his peers watched from a safe distance a few kilometers from the rocket. Their awe was evident as the rocket lifted off the launch pad and soared into the sky.
""When I grow up, I want to be a taikonaut, too. I will explore the vast universe just like them,"" Ma wrote in his diary.
The new achievements of China's space missions have ignited enthusiasm among Chinese youth, encouraging them to pursue their scientific dreams.
Xie Zhuohang, a fifth-grader from Sichuan's Mianyang, said he was happy to be part of the trip to the Jiuquan launch site and that he had learned a lot about space missions during this excursion.
Two years previously, Xie had participated in a local programming competition and made a model of a Long March series carrier rocket. ""Making a simple rocket model took me one week, so just imagine the effort needed to build a real one,"" he said.
Now, having watched astronauts embarking on a space mission on-site, his dream of flying higher and further has been greatly boosted.
""This launch base is exactly as I had imagined, surrounded by the vast Gobi Desert and dry air. Working here is such a cool thing,"" he said.
Most of the primary school students who participated in this activity became interested in aerospace by watching science experiments that were live-streamed from China's space station.
""I remember the lecture given by Wang Yaping on TV, through which I learned about laws of physics and the weightless condition,"" said Zhang Zinuo, a 10-year-old girl from Shaanxi.
She revealed that she now felt more connected and impressed by the passion the taikonauts have for their dreams and the space cause.
""The spaceship and the taikonauts used to be so far away from me, but now they are only several miles away,"" she said. Zhang is already planning on joining the science club at her school.
Science education has always been one of the important goals of China's space missions.
According to the National Work Committee of the Chinese Young Pioneers, more than 700 young students and teachers have been invited to either the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region or the Wenchang Space Launch Site in Hainan Province since 2023, giving them the opportunity to participate in space-themed programs.
Lei Jia, a staff member of the branch of the Chinese Young Pioneers of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said that this new experience will help children to develop a taste for science education and promote their scientific spirit.
""Perhaps, future aerospace industry stars are already among them,"" she said.
