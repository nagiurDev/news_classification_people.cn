China's commercial space industry embraces rapid growth,2024-03-15,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0315/c90000-20145682.html,"Home>>
		
China's commercial space industry embraces rapid growth
By Liu Shiyao (People's Daily) 16:42, March 15, 2024
At the beginning of 2024, a carrier rocket developed by Chinese commercial aerospace company OrienSpace blasted off from waters off the coast of Haiyang in east China's Shandong province, sending three satellites into the planned orbit.
The Gravity-1 commercial carrier rocket is the world's largest solid-propellant launch vehicle. Through technological innovation, its payload capacity has been expanded from 1 or 2 tons to 5 or 6 tons, while the launch costs have been reduced by over 30 percent.

The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket independently developed by Chinese private space launch provider LandSpace blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on July 12, 2023. It is the world's first rocket powered by liquid oxygen-methane fuel and successfully entered its planned orbit. (Photo from the official website of LandSpace)
The launch vehicle has facilitated the deployment of large-scale satellite constellations, enhanced China's capacity for diversified and large-scale launches of medium- and low-orbit satellites and enriched the country's launch vehicle variety.
The successful launch of the Gravity-1 rocket was a miniature of the rapid development of China's commercial spaceflight.
Commercial spaceflight refers to the participation in the development of the space industry through commercial operations under market principles. It aims at exploring new mechanisms for the marketization and commercialization of national civil space infrastructure.
In recent years, China's commercial space industry has transitioned from its initial stage to a period of rapid growth, becoming an important complement to the country's space endeavors.
According to a recently published blue paper, in 2023, a total of 26 commercial launches were completed (including rideshare and co-passenger launches), which accounted for 39 percent of China's total launches for the year. Among them, 25 were successful, marking a success rate of 96 percent.
Experts noted that China's commercial space industry has witnessed vigorous growth, emerging from its infancy to become a thriving sector. The industry has preliminarily established an industrial system and market system.
Today, a number of private companies have entered various segments of the commercial space sector, including rocket launches, satellite manufacturing, and satellite application services. Each leading commercial spaceflight enterprise has shown its own characteristics and development trends in areas such as rocket and satellite development, constellation deployment, and data services.
A relatively flexible market mechanism would contribute to technological exploration and innovation in the commercial space industry.
Last year, China launched a Long March-2D rocket to place 41 satellites, including the Jilin-1 Gaofen 06A developed by the Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd., in orbit, setting a domestic record for the most satellites lifted in one go.
The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket independently developed by Chinese private space launch provider LandSpace was successfully launched, becoming the world's first rocket powered by liquid oxygen-methane fuel to be successfully launched in a row.

Beijing Interstellar Glory Space Technology Ltd., better known as iSpace, completed the second flight test mission for its commercial reusable rocket SQX-2Y, the first reuse of such a rocket in China.
These achievements demonstrate the diverse research and development routes and directions of innovation of commercial space exploration, effectively promoting the overall progress of space technology.
With the help of satellite communication, it is now possible to make phone calls and send messages even in uninhabited areas. Commercial low-orbit satellites can immediately provide image coverage of the ground after earthquakes and other disasters, supporting emergency rescue efforts.
Zhong Xing, chief designer of Chang Guang satellites, said commercial remote sensing satellites have made China a world-class participant in remote sensing data acquisition. The price of satellite remote sensing data obtaining service has dropped from several hundred yuan to just over 10 yuan per square kilometer.
Zhong believes that the commercial space industry can help lower satellite launch costs and improve launch efficiency, thus contributing to large-scale satellite launches and faster constellation deployment, and better facilitating the economy, society, and people's lives.
Experts said that China's commercial space industry is bursting with vitality, demonstrating enormous market potential. High-frequency commercial launches will become a development trend, and intensive rocket launches will drive exponential growth in the number of commercial satellites. The networked deployment of low-Earth orbit satellite constellations will be an important trend in the development of commercial satellites.
Innovation is the gene of commercial spaceflight development. Chinese commercial space launch enterprise CAS Space has established a test center covering nearly 10,000 square meters in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, with an aim to meet various testing needs for the development of carrier rockets. Over 80 percent of the employees at OrienSpace are engaged in research and development. Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd. has invested more than 1.3 billion yuan (around $180 million) in research and development so far.
These examples demonstrate the high importance placed on technological innovation.
Thanks to technological innovation, the commercial space industry has continuously developed new technologies and created new models, promoting industrial innovation along the innovation chain and accelerating the formation of new quality productive forces.
Experts believe that the fruitful results of China's space innovation and the country's rich reserve of space talents provide strong support for the commercial space industry. China has the world's largest market demand and most diverse application scenarios, which offers a huge market for the commercial space industry in terms of technology translation and consumption.

 (Xinhua) 15:21, March 15, 2024
HARBIN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Russian joint research lab on Siberian tiger conservation was established at Northeast Forestry University in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province on Thursday.
The lab, with more than 20 experts from both sides, is co-developed by China's Feline Research Center of National Forestry and Grassland Administration and the Institute of Ecology and Evolution A.N.Severtsov of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The lab encompasses research areas such as wildlife ecology and management, Siberian tiger feeding and breeding, and wildlife genetics.
Siberian tigers, also known as Amur tigers, mainly reside in Russia's Far East and northeast China. As one of the world's most endangered species, just over 10 wild Siberian tigers were believed to be living in China at the end of the 20th century.
As the tigers frequently move between China and Russia, cooperation between the two sides is of vital importance, said Liu Ming, associate researcher from the International Society of Zoological Sciences.
Back in 2010, the two countries signed a cooperation agreement to protect Siberian tigers and Amur leopards, which are also one of the most endangered felines in the world.
The lab will form an international scientific research team engaged in endangered animal conservation, further deepen the theoretical and technical exchanges on Siberian tiger protection, and strengthen data sharing, said Jiang Guangshun, director of the laboratory expert committee.

Advanced technologies spur low-carbon lifestyle across China,2024-03-14,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0314/c98649-20145054.html,"Home>>People's Daily Online Exclusives

Advanced technologies spur low-carbon lifestyle across China
 (People's Daily Online) 13:23, March 14, 2024
Advanced green and low-carbon technologies have made their way in recent years to various industries in China, such as the construction, agriculture, and transportation sectors, empowering people across the country to enjoy eco-friendly lifestyles.
In China, the proportion of green building area in newly constructed area has exceeded 90 percent, according to Peng Shou, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Continuous breakthroughs in China's green building materials industry have constantly updated the industry's business forms, Peng said during a recent interview.
In Beijing’s Chaoyang district, a total of 20 energy-saving technologies of seven major categories have helped put an ""energy-saving outfit"" on a building constructed in 1987, making it Beijing's first zero-carbon building after renovation, and also a model of green buildings in the field of public building renovation.

Relevant technologies have reduced the building's energy consumption to 66 percent of its pre-renovation levels, and various photovoltaic facilities installed on the surface of the building act as ""energy collectors,"" providing sufficient electricity for the building, explained Gong Haiguang, director of the Beijing building energy efficiency research and development center.
Not long ago, the first zero-carbon office building in southwest China's Guizhou Province was put into use.
The building is equipped with two wind turbines, which are expected to generate 3,299 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually. The utilization of shallow geothermal energy helps ensure heating in winter and cooling in summer for the building.
""Green buildings are an essential means of shaping green production and lifestyles, and driving industrial transformation and upgrading,"" Peng said, noting that the implementation of relevant policies has given China an advantage in the large-scale development of green buildings.
Low-carbon technologies have also deeply integrated into the country's agriculture sector, facilitating efforts to achieve a win-win situation for agricultural production and environmental protection.
In Huantai county, Zibo city, east China's Shandong Province, a low-carbon wheat field covering an area of 200 mu (13.33 hectares) has realized the goal of increasing yield while ensuring environmental protection by employing no-till farming and precision fertilization, among other methods of modern agriculture.
The wheat field is on a farm operated under the Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) business model of Syngenta Group China, an agriculture giant owned by Sinochem Holdings.
Compared to traditional farming methods, these modern methods can increase the wheat yield per mu by about 7.5 percent, while reducing the use of agricultural machinery operations by two to three times, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by about 30 percent, according to Jiang Yekui, chief sustainability officer of Syngenta Group China.
""To reduce carbon emissions, we adopted the no-till farming method from the start. Compared to traditional methods, this approach allows the soil to better fix carbon,"" Jiang explained.
""More precise water and fertilizer management is also a key measure to reduce carbon emissions. By adopting the method of formulated fertilization based on soil testing and management technologies in integrating water and fertilizers, we have been able to save water by 50 percent and fertilizers by 30 to 50 percent,"" Jiang added.
In many cities across the country, smart urban public transportation networks empowered by low-carbon technologies have paved the way for green travel.
Bus-hailing services and mobile charging robots, as part of such smart transportation networks, have brought tangible benefits to urban residents in many Chinese cities.
Zhu Tingting, a woman who works for a company in Xi'an city, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, takes a ""pre-ordered"" shuttle bus from a subway station to her workplace every morning.
She places an order for the bus service on her mobile phone, and can get on the bus as soon as she gets out of the subway station, which has made commuting much more convenient, Zhu said.
Such ""pre-ordered"" shuttle buses, which reflects an innovative bus-hailing service Xi'an has launched to shape a diversified bus service system, allow citizens to enjoy ""on-demand, economical, fast, order-based, and one-stop"" bus rides, and have become the preferred choice for commuting for many people.
At a bamboo expo park in Anji county, east China's Zhejiang Province, a mobile charging robot saves owners of electric cars the trouble of waiting at or searching for charging piles themselves.
""In the past, car owners looked for charging piles to charge their cars. Now, charging piles look for vehicles that need to get charged,"" said Yu Xiang, vice president of China's electric vehicle charging service provider Newlink NaaS, adding that mobile charging robots have overcome the limitations of fixed charging piles in terms of site and battery capacity.
""Smart transportation has greatly optimized travel routes, promoted traffic safety, and facilitated energy conservation and emission reduction endeavors,"" said Wang Xianjin, vice president and chief engineer of China Academy of Transportation Sciences.
Smart transportation can contribute to China's efforts to realize its goal of peaking carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 on at least three levels, Wang noted.
First, smart transportation can integrate the resources of the transportation system and provide integrated transportation services, thus optimizing the structure of the transportation network; second, innovations and advancements in smart transportation technologies can bring significant changes to the entire industry, improving travel efficiency; and third, smart transportation technologies can ensure the accurate monitoring and measurement of carbon emissions across the transportation industry at relatively low social costs, providing a scientific basis for the formulation of relevant measures, he explained.

"Technology empowers ancient city wall preservation, tourism innovation",2024-03-14,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0314/c90000-20145002.html,"Home>>
		
Technology empowers ancient city wall preservation, tourism innovation
 (Xinhua) 10:51, March 14, 2024
XI'AN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Over the past few years, technology has played an increasingly important role in cultural heritage protection and the innovation of cultural tourism products in China. One of the beneficiaries of this trend is the Xi'an City Wall, China's largest and best-preserved ancient city wall.
Located at the heart of Xi'an, capital of the northwestern Shaanxi Province, the city wall was built as a military defense system over 600 years ago on the foundation of a prior structure dating back to the Sui and Tang dynasties (581-907). The wall is up to 14 meters wide at the top and consists of a series of military facilities, including watchtowers and crenels.
Bearing witness to history, the city wall also integrates seamlessly with modern urban life. Numerous tourists stroll on top of it or in the surrounding scenic area, while streams of vehicles pass through the city gates daily.
However, the city wall has experienced uneven settlement over the years, developing cracks and outward bulging in some parts. This produced the challenge of effectively preserving the ancient treasure without disrupting its modern functions. Conservation experts have responded to this challenge by seeking solutions via advanced technologies.
According to Su Ning, assistant director of the Xi'an City Wall Management Committee, over 3,000 monitoring spots have been set up along the wall complex, which has a circumference of 13.74 km. Nearly 2,400 of these monitoring spots keep track of wall settlement and more than 400 horizontal displacements.
Meanwhile, over 1,000 cameras have been installed at the city wall scenic area to detect real-time changes in visitor flow, water levels in the moat, and intrusion into prohibited areas, among others.
All monitoring data converge at the information center of the management committee and are displayed on large screens, said Su. Based on the data and the pattern of damage, the committee has set warning thresholds, while using different colors to represent different alert levels and implementing corresponding measures.
""Additionally, we have determined the city wall's static and dynamic load capacities, which are used to coordinate visitor flow to minimize the impact of tourism activities on the wall,"" said Su.
In 2023, muon imaging technology was used in a ""physical examination"" of the wall, marking the first application of this technology in relic conservation efforts in China.
Conducted by a research team from the School of Nuclear Science and Technology at Lanzhou University, muon imaging allows for high-precision scanning of the inside of the thick body of the wall to discover damage, without any harm to the wall -- in contrast with traditional methods.
Empowered by such technologies, conservation of the city wall has shifted from reactive repairs to proactive damage monitoring and prevention, Su noted.
Meanwhile, new ways of exploring the wall have emerged for visitors, with the rapid evolution of digital technologies giving birth to a diverse array of tourism products.
Upon entering the Xi'an City Wall scenic area, visitors can follow the guidance of a tour app that tells them the history of the city wall and shares stories concerning various attractions, while also indicating popular spots for taking photos.
Once visitors reach the area above the city wall's south gate, a 3-square-meter digital sand table vividly portrays the intricate layout of Chang'an City at the time when Xi'an was the capital of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), using state-of-the-art digital projection and visual effects to revive its glory days.
For those who cannot personally get there, a digital museum can offer an immersive tour of an archaeological research-themed museum inside the Xi'an City Wall. The museum houses the remains of the oldest part of the Xi'an City Wall -- a city gate built about 1,400 years ago, among other relics.
""Novel digital products can better evoke the public's fondness for history and culture,"" said Zhao Bin, director of the Xi'an City Wall Digital Industry Innovation Center, adding that the city wall scenic area had received over 8.5 million visitors in 2023.
In recent years, China has advocated a national cultural digitization strategy to invigorate the cultural sector and cultural industries. The implementation of this strategy is noted in this year's government work report delivered to the second session of the 14th National People's Congress.
The Xi'an City Wall will develop in line with the national cultural digitization strategy, strengthening collaboration with universities and enterprises to cement cultural relic preservation and cultural tourism, said Zhao.

Chinese researchers develop targeted nanomedicine for female Alzheimer's patients
 (Xinhua) 10:28, March 14, 2024
TIANJIN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a nanomedicine specifically for women with Alzheimer's disease.
A research team from Tianjin University's School of Life Sciences and the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital developed the nanomedicine, and the team's work has been published in the Nano Today journal.
Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degradation of memory and cognitive function. Studies have shown that women are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's than men, and there is also a notable gender discrepancy in the progression of Alzheimer's, with rates of disease progression and mortality being two to three times higher among women.
Research has indicated that the significant decline in estrogen levels in women after menopause may be the reason women are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's. Estrogen plays a vital role in safeguarding the female central nervous system, promoting neuronal growth and differentiation, and maintaining brain redox homeostasis by binding to specific receptors. Once women reach menopause, long-term estrogen deficiency induces neurodegeneration and aggravates cognitive decline.
The research team developed a multi-functional nanomedicine utilizing plant-derived estrogen glycyrrhetinic acid for the targeted treatment of postmenopausal female Alzheimer's disease. The nanomedicine is capable of activating neuroprotective signaling pathways mediated by specific estrogen receptors, thereby improving cognitive functions affected by estrogen deficiency.
The research team is now screening more precise nanomedicines for preclinical research.

Yang Mengfei, a distinguished spacecraft scientist and national political adviser, has called for government support for the research and development of a satellite capable of observing the sun from a solar polar orbit.
""The sun is the very star that created all life on Earth and has the biggest effect on humans. At the same time, solar activities are the root of many cosmic hazards that can disrupt human activities such as communications, power supply, air traffic and spacecraft operations,"" said Yang, a senior researcher at the China Academy of Space Technology and an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Space powers such as the United States, Europe and Japan have launched more than 70 spacecraft dedicated to solar observation. China has also deployed its first solar observation satellite.
""However, all these satellites have observed the sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. In other words, no spacecraft has ever reached a solar polar orbit,"" Yang said.
""If we could place a satellite in a solar polar orbit, it would provide data to our scientists to help them better understand the origins of the solar magnetic activity cycle and high-speed solar wind, which have a great impact on human activities.""
Yang said Chinese researchers have had the idea of satellite observation in the solar polar orbit for many years, but it has so far just remained on paper.
""The country now has the solid scientific, technological and engineering foundations needed for sending a satellite to a solar polar orbit. So I suggest that the government start the spacecraft's design work and list the solar comprehensive exploration project as a key state program,"" said Yang, who is also a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body.
He made the remarks on the sidelines of the annual session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, which concluded in Beijing on Sunday.
China launched its first space-based solar telescope — the Chinese H-Alpha Solar Explorer, or Xihe (the sun goddess in ancient Chinese mythology) — in October 2021, aiming to use the spacecraft as a solar imaging spectrometer as well as a test bed for cutting-edge satellite technologies.
Since its orbital deployment, the spacecraft has carried out spectral scanning and imaging of the sun's H-Alpha waveband and has recorded the dynamics of solar activities in the star's photosphere and chromosphere.
The data has enabled scientists around the world to extensively advance their research of the sun and the solar system, according to the China National Space Administration.

China unveils advanced AI model for medicine, boosting clinical diagnosis
 (Global Times) 15:10, March 13, 2024
A Hong Kong research center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has unveiled its latest artificial intelligence (AI) model for the healthcare industry, providing efficient clinical diagnosis and helping doctors in complex neurosurgery.
The development highlights the increasingly close academic collaboration between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, showcasing the country's leading position in the sector.
Developed by the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) of the CAS Hong Kong Institute of Science and Innovation, the CARES Copilot 1.0 model offers physicians enhanced accuracy in data retrieval. It can generate information and citations from academic sources, with data accuracy up to 95 percent, CAIR said on Monday.
Using the AI model for complement surgery, image navigation, and medical robotics in clinics, operating rooms and research institutes can directly assist medical staff in dealing with emergencies. They are able to provide supervision and early warnings and prevent risks during surgical procedures, Danny Chan Tat-ming, head of the neurosurgery division at the Department of Surgery in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, was quoted as saying.
The CARES Copilot system is designed to work with smart medical devices, providing trustable and explainable AI for surgery. It is able to process surgical data across modalities, including images, text, voice, video and ultrasound.
The performance of the Copilot 1.0 system was strictly tested using the challenging Zero-shot Top Token Selection standard, across five public datasets and two proprietary neurosurgical knowledge evaluation datasets, according to the research team of the CARES Copilot 1.0 AI model.
""We aim to integrate the Copilot 1.0 AI model with smart medical devices in the future, based on CAIR's achievements in medical robotics. The center is now collaborating with Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou on these subjects,"" Xu Jun, a senior manager at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
The CARES Copilot 1.0 system exemplifies CAIR's unique position and academic background, reflecting the close academic cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.
According to CAIR's official website, the center was established under a memorandum of understanding signed between the Hong Kong SAR Government and the CAS. It is part of the Hong Kong Institute of Science and Innovation, the CAS' first affiliated branch outside of the Chinese mainland.
The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is further advancing technological cooperation. In August 2023, China's State Council issued a plan to develop the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, aiming to deepen scientific and technological collaboration in the Greater Bay Area.

Researchers uncover future variations of irrigation water use in China,2024-03-13,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0313/c90000-20144519.html,"Home>>
		
Researchers uncover future variations of irrigation water use in China
 (Xinhua) 10:55, March 13, 2024
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have developed a new method using machine learning and multiple data sets to estimate irrigation water use (IWU) across China, and also revealed how water use might change in the future based on different climate and economic scenarios.
Irrigated agriculture accounts for about 20 percent of global croplands and contributes more than 40 percent of food production. China is home to the world's largest irrigated farmland, accounting for over half of the country's arable lands.
Therefore, water for irrigation is critical to the crop growth and yields. Accurately characterizing changes in IWU is conducive to formulating optimal water resource allocation policies, particularly in the context of climate change.
However, due to limited data availability and model constraints, it is hard to use existing IWU estimation methods on a national scale or under future climate change scenarios.
The researchers from the Aerospace Information Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed a new machine-learning model to estimate nationwide IWU under a data-driven framework.
The new model integrated a range of high-precision hydrological satellite remote sensing products, meteorological drivers, economic statistics and numerical model simulations. It showed high precision in IWU projections with over 90 percent accuracy rate.
Taking a series of climate and socioeconomic scenarios into consideration, the researchers combined the established machine-learning framework with four advanced Earth system models to forecast the future trends and additional costs of IWU across China over the next 70 years.
Under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, China's IWU is projected to increase in about 60 percent of provinces, especially in the northwest and northern regions.
IWU is also predicted to increase by 8.5 percent to 17.1 percent by 2050 compared to the historical period (1981-2010), with higher emissions leading to more significant increases.
This rise comes with an estimated additional cost of 1.65 to 3.91 billion U.S. dollars per year, highlighting the urgency for sustainable water management.
The research findings could provide crucial information for policymaking regarding agricultural water, contributing greatly to the sustainable use and management of water resources in the context of climate change and socioeconomic dynamics, the research team stated, adding that the results are also conducive for other countries confronted with increasing irrigation demands.
An article about this discovery was published in the journal Earth's Future.

 (Xinhua) 10:45, March 13, 2024
HAIKOU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) has confirmed the launch of an intelligent breeding platform for breeding data processing.
The platform, jointly developed by the Hainan-based National Nanfan Research Institute (Sanya), the Institute of Crop Sciences under the CAAS and Alibaba's DAMO Academy, features world-leading data capacity, speed and data security measures.
It has realized integration of the whole breeding process, including breeding data management and analysis, optimization and acceleration of large model and large computing power, identification of suitable parents, and prediction of excellent varieties via an artificial intelligence algorithm.
High-throughput data analysis used in the breeding process requires huge computing power, modeling technology, complex command line operation skills, and various toolkits -- which is inconvenient for researchers to operate.
This meant that the development of a high-throughput computing platform with rich functionality, a friendly operation interface, and which relies on cloud services and artificial intelligence for precision breeding, was a priority.
The recently launched platform offers key features such germplasm resource information management, breeding experiment design and simulation, mass breeding omics data storage, high-throughput data analysis, and intelligent breeding decision-making.
It supports the integration and deep mining of large-scale omics information and phenotypic information data, said the CAAS.
Based on a self-developed breeding decision algorithm, the platform can accurately predict crop traits and identify excellent genotypes, which will improve the accuracy and efficiency of variety breeding.
The platform also uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to efficiently manage, schedule and analyze breeding big data, while the speed of operation of this process has been greatly improved.
To date, breeders from 23 research units around the world have used the platform, according to the CAAS.
The platform combines massive crop breeding data with an advanced big data algorithm, providing a new option for intelligent breeding, said Qian Qian, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

China's mountainous Yunnan adopts AI for power facility inspections
 (Xinhua) 10:30, March 13, 2024
KUNMING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's southwestern province of Yunnan has deployed artificial intelligence (AI) to carry out most routine inspections at 621 power substations, replacing the need for human interventions.
The AI inspection, powered by cameras, drones and walking robots, is capable of completing a task in less than five minutes, down from the five hours required by human workers, according to the Yunnan branch of the China Southern Power Grid.
A major producer of hydropower and other forms of clean electricity, Yunnan has 1,937 power substations of 35 kilovolts or above, many of which are located in mountainous areas. Access to nearly half of these substations requires travel of more than three hours by road, said Wang Xin, a senior manager of the Yunnan branch.
AI-powered automatic inspections are expected to exempt human workers from lengthy road travels, thereby greatly reducing costs, according to Wang.
The China Southern Power Grid has planned to promote AI inspections to the rest of the substations in the province over the next two years.
China is increasingly turning to robotic technologies to tackle the shortage of technicians in remote mountainous areas. Last year, the mountainous province of Guizhou also started using robots for the inspection of power substations that are susceptible to disruptions by extreme weather conditions.

China should use targeted measures to develop its robotics industry further, focusing on key areas such as cutting-edge foundational technologies, the localization of critical components and enhancing the performance of overall applications, in order to stay competitive beyond its domestic market, said national legislators and industry analysts.
China has become a critical driving force for bolstering the development of the global robotics industry, said Zhang Jin, a deputy to the 14th National People's Congress and president of Liaoning province-based Siasun Robot and Automation Co, one of the largest robotics firms in the country.
The company has made big strides in autonomous robot controllers and validated servo motors and drivers. By demonstrating the capabilities and reliability of domestic industrial robot components, the company is helping to strengthen the country's position in the global robotics market, said Zhang.
Siasun has been conducting research and development of high-speed, high-load and high-precision industrial robot systems, so as to sharpen its competitive edge, Zhang added.
The industrial robot market in China experienced steady growth in 2023, with sales reaching 316,000 units, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.29 percent, according to a report released by the Gaogong Industry Research Institute.
A notable shift in market share between domestic and foreign manufacturers was seen last year. For the first time, domestic industrial robots accounted for more than half of the market, reaching a share of 52.45 percent, according to the report.
China has achieved a significant milestone in the industrial robot industry by developing a complete supply chain and achieving breakthroughs in core components, said Lu Hanchen, director of the institute.
With the ability to control costs, enhance product competitiveness, and foster collaboration between upstream and downstream partners, domestic industrial robot companies are well-positioned to dominate the market, Lu added.
In terms of functionality, domestic brands have shown remarkable progress, and their advantages lie in user-friendliness and the level of intelligence embedded in their products, Zhang said.
He added that hundreds of Siasun's robot models have been sold to over 40 countries and regions, serving more than 3,000 multinational corporations worldwide.
However, a lack of high-end applications is a crucial bottleneck hampering the industry's progress.
High-end applications, such as those in the semiconductor industry, require specialized robots capable of operating in vacuum environments. These robots play a vital role in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of manufacturing processes in sensitive industries, Zhang said.
Liaoning province's role as the cradle of China's robotics industry, coupled with its inherent advantages in academia, research, computing infrastructure and application scenarios, positions it as a stronghold for innovation in the robotics sector, Zhang said.
Going forward, it is imperative to support the establishment of a national technology innovation center in the northeastern region of China, so as to create an ecosystem that fosters collaboration and synergy among different elements of the innovation ecosystem including industry, funding and talent, Zhang added.

KUNMING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Luo Jie, an associate researcher from the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a keen diving enthusiast, which allows him to breed corals not only limited to his laboratory but also in real waters.
Luo still recalls the vast, colorful ""undersea forests"" he encountered nine years ago as a novice diver. However, the beautiful scenes have been long replaced by more and more pale coral ""graveyards.""
In the context of global warming, due to water quality changes and overfishing, one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have bleached and died since 2016, and the total area of coral reefs keeps shrinking according to scientists.
""Coral reefs cover less than 1 percent of the ocean, but shelter up to 25 percent of marine life. When coral reefs are destroyed, the marine environment is affected, and the marine life chain will be lost along with it,"" Luo said.
""Some scientists even predict that more than 70 percent of corals will bleach by 2030, and if nothing is done, all the reefs will be gone by 2050,"" he added.
How to keep corals from bleaching has then become his major subject. Luo began to focus on zooxanthellae, which can easily affect coral's life and death.
After five years of research and experiment, Luo designed a set of systems that can automatically control the physical and chemical environment of water and the type of biological community, which allows him to cultivate corals and fish in ""seawater"" simulated in his laboratory.
Mere restoring coral populations in the laboratory did not seem to satisfy the 38-year-old researcher.
In January 2020, Luo was invited to conduct some coral preservation research by a Chinese power plant in Bali, a renowned resort in Indonesia. Indonesia, with one of the world's richest coral reefs, is home to about 40,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, accounting for 16 percent of the world's total.
However, at that time, the local coral reefs north of Bali were bleaching and dying on a massive scale due to the El Nino weather pattern and overfishing. Luo and his team decided to transplant the corals underwater.
On June 8, 2023, about three years after their first experimental coral transplantation, Luo made a back-roll entry into the waters and directly swam towards their coral area. Thankfully, a vast expanse of corals of various colors greeted him, with abundant fish and shrimps living nearby.
Having confirmed that the corals have grown into strong ""coral trees,"" Luo knew they had passed Mother Nature's mock exam. He shared the good news with the local fishermen who thanked the Chinese researchers for their efforts to bring the undersea garden back to life.
On June 13, 2023, local fishermen and some Chinese enterprises and research institutes began their relay of transplanting some 100 corals to the designated waters.
""It is a real race, with stringent time and handover requirements,"" Luo said, adding that the fragile coral polyps, which corals are grown from, are extremely demanding on the living environment, and thus they need to accurately control the temperature and humidity during transportation, as even a slight bump may cause the coral animals to break and die. ""So every link, from land transportation, sea handover, to the final underwater planting, must be very careful.""
Though it was a long haul to stay underwater for seven hours each day at a water temperature less than 30 degrees Celsius and even get hurt from the aggressive triggerfish, Luo found his efforts paid off generously.
""An Indonesian fisherman in his 70s told me that in the 1970s, they had few employment opportunities and could only make money by digging corals and hunting fish which was brutal. But now everyone understands that there is no fish without corals and the locals have learnt to protect them thanks to the coral protection and breeding lectures given by our Chinese researchers,"" Luo said.
Back in his laboratory, Luo has bred more than 200 varieties of corals over the past 15 years, to help better select specific varieties when restoring the reefs.
He is also building a new laboratory to provide a germplasm pool for the species in case any subspecies become extinct some day. In the future, Luo hopes to make his own documentary, illustrating breeding and transplanting techniques for more people in detail, so that the undersea beauty would never fade again.
