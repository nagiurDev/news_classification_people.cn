A Beijing-based research institute is set to officially unveil the world's first prototype of the intelligent humanoid TongTong, also known as ""Little Girl."" Once activated, it can be customized to provide warm companionship in households and nursing homes.
Dressed in red shoes, pink trousers, and a white T-shirt with a cute clasp, TongTong is capable of engaging with her ""daddy"" and ""mummy"" individually, understanding their intentions and participating in tasks such as helping them mop the floor, washing a dirty rag, and switching on the TV.
Staff at the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), which developed TongTong, told the Global Times she can acquire human characteristics, interact with humans in a multimodal manner, and autonomously complete tasks.
When she sees a mirror, she chooses to wipe off the red dots on her face, rather than the red dots seen in the mirror, and can snack on a cookie when she is hungry, reflecting her self-awareness. Currently, TongTong can help with a range of tasks. When her mother wants to move a basket, she takes away the chair that blocks it and when her mother spills milk on the floor, she finds a rag and mops it up and then cleans the dirty rag herself.
TongTong is guided by two cognitive systems - the U system (capability) and the V system (value). This allows her to approach tasks in a unique manner, depending on her current state, which is evaluated across five dimensions: hunger, boredom, thirst, fatigue, and sleepiness.
She also has emotions, and when feeling less amicable toward her daddy, she opts to ignore the tipped-over cup on the ground, rather than taking the initiative to help as she did with her mother.
However, there are still gaps before LittleGirl can seamlessly join reality. The Global Times noticed that she is not flexible enough. When interacting with her mother, she is emotionally neutral, lacking any facial expression and appearing somewhat awkward.
""Her mental and value system is comparable to that of a 3- or 4-year-old child. As it continues to be developed and iterated, she will become more vivid, lively, and real, just like us humans. You will see if you come back at the end of this year or next year to experience it again,"" Zhu Song-Chun, director of the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, told the Global Times.
Once the basic framework is established, similar to how a child's potential is developed and uncovered, TongTong's learning ability will accelerate, and she will need probably two or three years to progress from age 3 to 18, rather than 15 years, Zhu said.
Through continuous iteration, TongTong will be able to complete tasks like assisting humans with pouring tea and water and offering warm companionship in households, as well as being deployed in multiple tailored scenarios such as nursing homes.
In the future, BIGAI aims to create a family for TongTong, including grandparents, younger siblings, and friends from kindergarten. She will engage in more complex interactions in various scenarios and operate in more complex environments, the Global Times learned.
Asked why training TongTong in the most common abilities in daily life was the priority, Zhu explained that people used to think normal abilities that humans possess and things that they can see at a glance are not considered intelligent because these problems are way too simple. But in fact, human intelligence is about the inner workings of the mind and the moral compass that drives decision-making.
Zhu emphasized that a value-driven approach is important to machine intelligence for future integration in human society, compared to current data-driven approaches.
The concept of ""giving machines a heart and endowing them with reason"" also aligns with the Chinese national conditions for the development of safe and beneficial artificial intelligence, he said.
TongTong will be officially unveiled to the public on April 27 at the 2024 Zhongguancun Forum in Beijing from April 25 to 29.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Three astronauts who took part in the Shenzhou-16 crewed mission were on Thursday awarded medals for their services to China's space endeavors.
Jing Haipeng was honored with a special-class aerospace achievement medal. Zhu Yangzhu and Gui Haichao received third-class aerospace achievement medals and the honorary title of ""Heroic Astronaut.""
The awards were given by the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the State Council and the Central Military Commission.
Jing carried out crewed space missions four times and served as the mission commander three times. He is the Chinese astronaut who has carried out the most crewed missions for his country.
Zhu is the country's first space flight engineer to carry out a crewed space mission and conduct extravehicular activities.
Gui is China's first payload expert to carry out a crewed space mission.
Launched on May 30, 2023, the Shenzhou-16 spaceship sent the trio to China's space station core module Tianhe, where they lived and worked for five months.
During their stay, they performed extravehicular activities once, delivered a live class from the space station, and conducted a series of space-science experiments and in-orbit payload experiments.
The trio returned to Earth safely on Oct. 31, 2023. The Shenzhou-16 mission is the first crewed mission for the application and development stage of China's space station. It is also the first time that three types of astronaut -- pilot, flight engineer and payload expert -- have carried out a mission together.

GUIYANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts recently discovered a panda fossil site during a scientific expedition in a cave in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
This latest discovery in Shuanghe Cave, Asia's longest cave, comprised panda skeletal remains and teeth fossils, said Wang Deyuan, an assistant researcher at Guizhou Academy of Sciences, one of the institutes involved in the scientific expedition.
""Based on the degree of tooth wear, it can be inferred that the fossil belongs to an adult panda,"" Wang said, adding that further testing is needed to determine the specific era it inhabited.
Since 1988, Shuanghe Cave has seen 22 international joint scientific expeditions. So far, over 40 individual giant panda fossils have been found here, with the oldest specimen dating back at least 100,000 years, while the most recent is only a few hundred years old.
""The successive discoveries of panda fossil sites hold significant importance for research on the evolution of the ancient geological environment of Shuanghe Cave, as well as the living conditions of its flora and fauna,"" Wang said.
As of September 2023, Shuanghe Cave has been measured to be 409.9 kilometers in length, making it the longest cave in Asia and the third longest in the world.

Chinese scientists identify how neurons in mammals encode time
 (Xinhua) 16:31, April 18, 2024
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists identified how a specific region of neuron clusters in a mammal's brain encodes the time of the day, a finding that lend to new clues to decipher human being's biological clock design at a systematic level.
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is known as the mammalian central circadian pacemaker with different types of neurons acting in concert while each neuron harbors a self-sustained molecular clockwork. But how system-level SCN signals record time was mysterious.
The researchers from Peking University used a high-speed dual-view two-photon microscope they developed to realize calcium ion imaging of up to 9,000 neurons in adult SCN slices, and then they leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) methods to understand meanings of those signals as a whole.
The population-level calcium ion signals can predict hourly time via a group decision-making mechanism, according to the study published recently in the journal Cell Research.
They achieved hourly time prediction by polling random cohorts of SCN neurons, reaching 99 percent accuracy at a cohort size of 900, according to the study.
""The SCN is the mammal's central biological clock, which receives and processes external light information, calculates time and outputs signals to guide the behaviors of organisms,"" said Wang Zichen from Peking University, the first author of the paper.

AI platform doubles detection rates for early-stage esophageal cancer
 (Xinhua) 11:13, April 18, 2024
HANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that doubles the detection rate for early-stage esophageal cancer.
Esophageal cancer is often asymptomatic, but experienced clinicians can detect tumors and precancerous lesions with endoscopies. The five-year survival rate is over 90 percent when the tumor is treated during the early stages while the clinical outcomes decline sharply once patients start experiencing symptoms.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine, described an architecture driven by deep learning algorithms, which are trained via datasets of more than 190,000 esophageal images gathered from several clinics in China.
The clinical trial, run by researchers from Taizhou Hospital in Zhejiang Province and Wuhan University's Renmin Hospital, recruited more than 3,000 participants who underwent endoscopies. The AI system was used on half the volunteers.
This platform helps double the detection rate for high-risk esophageal lesions (1.8 percent) compared with that in the control group (0.9 percent), according to the study.
Also, the real-time AI tool has shown a high sensitivity and specificity of 89.7 percent and 98.5 percent, respectively, in the real world.
""The endoscopic assistance system, to a significant extent, enables endoscopists with less experience to enhance detection rates of high-risk esophageal lesions, thereby, reducing the frequency of missed diagnoses,"" said Mao Xinli, the corresponding author of the paper, from Taizhou Hospital.

GUIYANG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, has identified more than 900 new pulsars since its launch in 2016, its operator said Wednesday.
Pulsars, or fast-spinning neutron stars, originate from the imploded cores of massive dying stars through supernova explosions.
Han Jinlin, a scientist with the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), said that the pulsars included over 120 binary pulsars, more than 170 millisecond pulsars, and 80 faint and intermittent pulsars.
Han added that over the past 50-plus years since the discovery of the first pulsar, less than 3,000 pulsars were discovered worldwide, and the number of new pulsars discovered by FAST is more than three times the total number of pulsars found by foreign telescopes during the same period.
""The study has important implications for understanding the dense remnants of dead stars in the Milky Way and their radiation characteristics,"" Han said.
Pulsar observation is an important task for FAST, which can be used to confirm the existence of gravitational radiation and black holes, and help find answers to many other major questions in physics.
Jiang Peng, chief engineer of the FAST, said that all staff members make every effort to improve the performance of the telescope. At present, the annual observation time of the telescope is about 5,300 hours, and it plays an important role in the continuous output of scientific research achievements.
Located in a deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province, FAST started formal operation in January 2020. It is believed to be the world's most sensitive radio telescope.

HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) announced on Wednesday that it has pioneered a new stem cell model to help personalize treatment for patients suffering from rare forms of immunodeficiency.
According to the university, primary immunodeficiencies, also known as ""inborn errors of immunity"", are debilitating diseases, which compromise the immune system. Owing to their rarity, a significant number of immunodeficiencies remain underdiagnosed and undertreated.
Collaborating with partners at the Centre for Translational Stem Cell Biology (CTSCB) and the University of Cambridge, the HKUMed has pioneered a new stem cell platform to help patients with primary immunodeficiencies.
The research team took blood samples from patients and re-engineered the patients' cells into expanded potential stem cells, which can be used as personalized disease models, enabling various therapies to be tested to identify the most effective and safest treatment options without causing unnecessary risk to the patients.
""Using our innovative platform, we successfully identified safe, effective and novel treatment options for individuals with rare immunological diseases,"" Philip Li Hei, Division Chief of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology of the HKUMed, said.
The research findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Last year's Central Economic Work Conference called for nurturing strategic emerging industries such as the commercial space industry, and this year's government work report proposed to actively build the commercial space industry as a new growth engine, both showing that China's commercial space industry has entered a new stage, said Lyu Bo, deputy director of the Department of System Engineering of CNSA, at a press conference in Beijing.
At present, nine types of commercial launch vehicles are available for launch services, and a number of enterprises are building constellations consisting of about 100 satellites, he said, adding that the country's first commercial launch site is under construction.
The press conference briefed on the upcoming Space Day of China, which falls on April 24. Its major events will be held in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province.
At the briefing, Guo Bin, a Hubei provincial government official, said that the total output value of the commercial space industry and related industries in the province reached 56 billion yuan (about 7.74 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023.
There are over 300 commercial aerospace and related industry enterprises in Hubei, forming a complete industrial chain covering rocket and satellite development, ground equipment support and satellite operation services, said Guo.
Space technology is widely used in natural resources, emergency management, ecological protection, transportation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, smart cities and other fields. The integration of communication, navigation and remote sensing satellite technology with 5G and artificial intelligence has broad prospects for development, Guo said.
The official also explained the development of the commercial space industry in the province, such as the commercial rocket industrial park, the flexible intelligent production line for small satellites, the integrated satellite data platform for public service, and the high precision BeiDou navigation application chip.
Yao Qing, an official with the Wuhan municipal government, told the press that the Wuhan National Aerospace Industry Base aims to achieve the coordinated development of the whole industrial chain by focusing on new launch vehicles, satellite platforms and payloads, ground and terminal products, satellite internet, space-based internet, and other fields.

GUIYANG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, has identified more than 900 new pulsars since its launch in 2016.
The number of new pulsars discovered by FAST is more than three times the total number of pulsars found by foreign telescopes during the same period, Han Jinlin, a scientist with the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), said on Wednesday.
One of the important implications of the research on pulsars is to provide cosmic coordinates for possible future interstellar travel, Han noted.
FAST started formal operations in January 2020 and was officially opened to the world in March 2021. The telescope provides astronomers around the globe with a powerful tool to uncover the mysteries and evolution of the universe, said Jiang Peng, chief engineer of the FAST.
SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION
British astronomer Ralph Eatough, who has been interested in Chinese culture, history and literature since he was young, said that he felt extremely lucky to travel to China and join the FAST research group, the members of which have been very welcoming.
Having earned a doctorate in pulsar astrophysics at the University of Manchester, Eatough works as a pulsar astronomer at the NAOC and takes charge of pulsar data processing and time-frequency system optimization.
Pulsars are extremely compact remnants of massive stars that, whilst spinning extremely quickly (sometimes hundreds of times a second), emit beams of electromagnetic radiation that can sweep past the Earth -- a bit like a cosmic lighthouse, he said.
Thanks to its high sensitivity, the telescope can detect very faint pulsars that were previously too far away to identify.

In the past few years, Eatough has joined Chinese scientists and performed many observations with FAST, searching for undiscovered pulsars and precisely measuring the properties of pulsars found with FAST.
He has been searching for pulsars in the small satellite galaxies surrounding the Milky Way. ""These would be the most distant pulsars known, and it is only now with the sensitivity of FAST that we have the chance to detect them. Such pulsars could tell us a lot about the unmeasured gaseous material that surrounds the Milky Way,"" Eatough said.
Eatough said that opening up FAST to the world means that now astronomers can perform experiments that were previously not possible due to insufficient telescope sensitivity, with a prime example of this being the potential to detect pulsars located in external galaxies.
According to Sun Chun, engineer in charge of FAST measurement and control, FAST has received applications from 15 foreign countries, including the United States, Germany and Japan, and approved a total of nearly 900 hours for observation. The applications mainly involve fast radio burst observations, pulsar observations, and neutral hydrogen surveys, Sun added.
TOURISM EXCHANGE
The telescope has attracted many tourists from home and abroad since its inception.
The telescope, located in a naturally deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province, has a reception area equal to 30 standard football fields.

This February, a total of 34 people from a French delegation, including students, young volunteers and staff members from the Secours populaire fran ais, visited the telescope and the memorial hall dedicated to the late chief engineer of the FAST project, Nan Rendong.
It was the first time for Florent Madrolle, a French translator, to visit China and see the gigantic telescope. ""The size and the technology were very impressive,"" said Madrolle.
Five kilometers away from FAST in Kedu Township, the memorial hall has attracted a lot of tourists and visitors eager to pay tribute to Nan.
Nan, who selected the site of FAST and oversaw its construction, died in 2017 due to sickness at the age of 72. China honored him with several posthumous titles, including the ""role model of our times.""
Thibouw Laurine said that during this trip, she not only saw the telescope and knew its functions, but was also deeply touched by and eager to know more stories about Nan.
TECHNICAL INNOVATION
Since its inception, the telescope has continually prompted special technical progress through the efforts of a team of scientists led by Jiang.
""I thought we would revise the design scheme seven or eight times, and didn't expect that the first version would be so successful, with its performance reaching the globally advanced level,"" said Chai Xiaoming excitedly, senior engineer at the NAOC. She pointed at a silver-plated low-noise amplifier (LNA), which was only the size of a harmonica.
The LNA is the core component of the telescope's receiver. It had been imported from foreign countries including the United States, Sweden and Australia previously.
To master the key technology, Chai and her team spent nearly two years developing a high-performance domestic low-noise amplifier.
As soon as the prototype of the LNA was launched, it attracted the attention of the international astronomical community. The Brazilian BINGO project contacted the telescope's operation and development center for batch purchase of the LNA.
Chai said that if the cooperation is reached, it would be the first time that the core components, independently developed by the telescope's operation and development center, are exported overseas.
The FAST project had no experience to follow and was destined to meet unprecedented challenges. ""No one told you what to do, and no one was sure what would work,"" said Jiang, adding that the construction stage was filled with trials and failures.
Jiang said that if FAST was only regarded as a telescope or a piece of observational equipment, it would have already sufficed. But to maintain its leading position in the world, his team will make every effort to ensure that the FAST becomes even more stable and more efficient.

At present, the annual observation time of the telescope is about 5,300 hours, and it plays an important role in the continuous output of scientific research achievements.
In the near future, the telescope will provide the international astronomical community with new perspectives, allowing them to further explore the universe and try to find the unknown, and make greater contributions to helping human beings break into new fields of cognition, Jiang added.

Letter from China: Envisioning intelligent driving in near future,2024-04-17,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0417/c90000-20158004.html,"Home>>
		
Letter from China: Envisioning intelligent driving in near future
By Yue Xitong (Xinhua) 15:05, April 17, 2024
BEIJING/SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- In the not-so-distant past, if I had been asked to sum up my attitude to intelligent transportation in one word, it would have been ""indifferent."" But what a difference a week can make.
Last week, I was a passenger in a driverless taxi in Beijing E-town, a national-level economic-technological development area. It was an impressive experience that really drove home how quickly things can change.
Curious and a little nervous, I climbed into the rear seat of an unmanned car, technically supported by Pony.ai, an autonomous driving service provider. A disembodied voice prompted me to secure my belt and press a small screen in front of me. In the blink of an eye, the engine was activated, and I was on my way.
The half-hour ride was smoother than I expected, with the car adeptly navigating cyclists and various obstacles without any need for intervention.
In March 2023, China approved the commercial operation of autonomous driving services, allowing tech giant Baidu and Pony.ai to provide fully driverless rides without a safety supervisor aboard in the 60-square-km economic-technological development area in suburban Beijing.
As of April, Pony.ai has clocked up more than 31 million km in autonomous driving tests, with fully driverless tests surpassing 3 million km, according to Li Chengxue, from Pony.ai's PR department.
Wondering whether the unmanned ride would disturb other drivers, my eyes were constantly darting back and forth, but fellow road users seemed nonplussed at this auto newcomer.
""Residents in E-town are used to such cars,"" Li said.
By the end of 2023, over 30 Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou had issued road test licenses for autonomous driving.
Intelligent transportation is not just for people but has been applied to scenarios like courier and freight services. What I saw recently in WestWell, an autonomous-driving developer in metropolis Shanghai, is a testament.
The startup was said to have made the unmanned truck that features in the Chinese domestic blockbuster ""The Wandering Earth Ⅱ."" I asked Westwell vice president Zhang Bo, ""Was that truck an imitation or just a film prop?""
""No, it is real! Our Q-truck,"" Zhang said ambitiously.
The Q-truck is an electric autonomous vehicle like no other. About 3 meters high and 4 meters long, the cuboid is capable of pulling a 13-meter trailer loaded with containers of 75 tonnes in maximum weight.
Given its huge bulk and long endurance, the truck has been used to support smart ports. Zhang told me that Q-trucks were introduced to Laem Chabang Port in Thailand in 2020, and now about a half of the port's container delivery depends on such trucks.
Now this Chinese high-tech company has provided products and services for customers from 18 countries and regions in the world, covering harbors, land ports, airports, railway hubs and manufacturers, Zhang added.
After experiencing autonomous driving on the ground, let's take a look at something exciting in the air. My eye-opening trip to Shanghai acquainted me with a new term -- eVTOL, and the possibility of ""flying taxis.""
EVTOL, literally meaning electric vertical takeoff and landing, refers to a kind of aerial vehicle that is capable of taking off vertically and switching to smooth cruising at an altitude between 600 and 30,000 meters.
Different from traditional helicopters, most eVTOL aircraft are electricity-powered and autonomous driving. They require less space for takeoff and landing and generate less noise and pollution.
I paid a visit to AutoFlight, a Shanghai-based developer of eVTOLs. In February, its latest generation of eVTOL aircraft, co-named Prosperity, completed a trial commercial flight in south China's Guangdong Province.
The flight, about 50 km in distance within 20 minutes, marked the world's first public demonstration of an eVTOL aircraft on a cross-sea and inter-city route.
At the company's display area, I saw the engine. I was amazed by its weight, as I could carry one of its propeller blades with one hand.
The company's brand department told me that the propellers were made of special materials that it developed in-house. Relatively smaller weight helps further increase the aircraft's takeoff capacity.
My interest in eVTOLs took off at that moment, so I jumped into the cabin of Prosperity. It is equipped with four passenger seats and one pilot seat, and was quite comfortable.
An increasing number of eVTOLs can be spotted buzzing above Chinese cities as the manufacturers step up efforts to commercialize this emerging aviation tech. AutoFlight said it has inked an order for 30 aircraft with ZTO Express, one of the leading express delivery companies in China.
The emerging industry gave rise to a new economic mode called ""low-altitude economy."" According to a report published earlier this month, the size of this economy exceeded 500 billion yuan (69.08 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023, up 33.8 percent year-on-year.
The report also revealed that the country's eVTOL industry registered close to 1 billion yuan. As of February, there are more than 57,000 enterprises in China's low-altitude economic sector.
Expected to be approved by the Civil Aviation Administration to put its eVTOLs into commercial operation in 2026, AutoFlight plans to price the airfare for a one-way passenger at 300 yuan. ""Taking flying taxis to work is truly foreseeable in the near future!"" I marveled.

GUIYANG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, has identified more than 900 new pulsars since its launch in 2016, its operator said Wednesday.
Pulsars, or fast-spinning neutron stars, originate from the imploded cores of massive dying stars through supernova explosions.
Han Jinlin, a scientist with the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), said that the pulsars included over 120 binary pulsars, more than 170 millisecond pulsars, and 80 faint and intermittent pulsars.
Han added that over the past 50-plus years since the discovery of the first pulsar, less than 3,000 pulsars were discovered worldwide, and the number of new pulsars discovered by FAST is more than three times the total number of pulsars found by foreign telescopes during the same period.
""The study has important implications for understanding the dense remnants of dead stars in the Milky Way and their radiation characteristics,"" Han said.
Pulsar observation is an important task for FAST, which can be used to confirm the existence of gravitational radiation and black holes, and help find answers to many other major questions in physics.
Jiang Peng, chief engineer of the FAST, said that all staff members make every effort to improve the performance of the telescope. At present, the annual observation time of the telescope is about 5,300 hours, and it plays an important role in the continuous output of scientific research achievements.
Located in a deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province, FAST started formal operation in January 2020. It is believed to be the world's most sensitive radio telescope.

Smart tech empowers cement plant in south China
 (Xinhua) 08:25, April 17, 2024
NANNING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- At a cement ore field in the southern Chinese city of Baise, a fleet of trucks laden with limestones shuttled back and forth. A close look revealed that they're driverless.
Those electrically driven trucks are equipped with multiple sensors like LiDAR, millimeter wave radar and vision cameras. Enabled with 5G tech and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, they are controlled by an intelligent console and run automatically throughout the mine lot.
The cement plant under China Resources Group exemplified the traditional industry upgrading of the manufacturing powerhouse, driven by emerging digital and smart technology.
By the end of 2023, China had built 421 national-level demonstration factories featuring intelligent manufacturing and over 10,000 local digital workshops and smart factories.
China has unveiled an action plan to promote industrial equipment upgrades. By 2027, the penetration rate of digital research and development (R&D) and design tools in major enterprises will exceed 90 percent, and over 75 percent of their key production processes will be digitally controlled.
In 2023, the cement plant in Baise adopted a whole-mine unpiloted transport system developed by Waytous, a Beijing-based intelligent mining tech provider incubated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The unmanned project was the first of its kind built in one go in China.
The ore blending in traditional cement plants mainly relies on human experience. It's a process of mixing ores of different grades after they're extracted to ensure the quality standards required.
However, the traditional scheduling dependent on manual labor is time-consuming and not optimal. It tends to result in low vehicle utilization rates and more wasted ores.
Now, the plant uses digital twin and 3D modeling technology to produce a virtual simulation model of an ore body with a reserve of 71 million tonnes.
The AI algorithm has been employed to construct a digital model that can automatically generate optimal plans for the combinations of mining locations and mining volume.
The digital upgrading has brought a 105 percent increase in labor productivity, a 56 percent reduction in unplanned equipment downtime, a 25 percent increase in quality stability and a 24 percent reduction in carbon emissions, said Sun Zhen, general manager of the plant.
At the site, the whole process including cement mining, grinding and delivery has been digitalized and intelligently controlled.
""The system can be automatically tuned in the background running process, so that it can run in a more economical and stable state,"" said Luo Ling, an engineer sitting before a screen in the centralized smart control center.
In December, the cement plant was selected as an ""Advanced Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) Lighthouse"" or ""lighthouse factory"" by the World Economic Forum.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's communication and navigation technology test satellites, Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2, have successfully carried out experiments on new technologies such as highly reliable Earth-Moon transmission and routing, according to Science and Technology Daily on Monday.
The telemetric data showed that the test project could effectively improve the accuracy of spacecraft in determining the lunar orbit.
The two satellites were sent into space together with the Queqiao-2 relay satellite on March 20. They entered their target circumlunar orbits on March 29 and separated on April 3.
On April 8, Tiandu-1 started flying in formation with Tiandu-2, remaining at a distance of about 200 kilometers. The two satellites operate in normal communication, stable attitude and energy balance.
They laid an important foundation for carrying out a series of communication technology test missions, according to the report, noting that Tiandu-2 has captured and sent back Earth-Moon group images.
Queqiao-2, Tiandu-1, and Tiandu-2 all use a highly elliptical lunar frozen orbit as their target orbits. This kind of orbit is stable, ensuring the spacecraft travels with minimum trajectory deviation.
