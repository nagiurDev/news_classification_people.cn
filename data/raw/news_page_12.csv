To date, nearly 350 international workshops have trained over 14,000 people in Juncao technology, with introductory papers now available in 18 languages for global use.
""The experimental results were very promising,"" Professor Lin Zhanxi said. ""Juncao is the grass of happiness, a gift from China to all.""
KIGALI/FUZHOU, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- It was pleasantly warm and dry in Rwanda in early August, and young farmers in Southern Province were celebrating a bountiful harvest. Their hands were not bunched with corn or rice but with mushrooms, cultivated with the help of a technology transferred from a country far away to this ""land of a thousand hills"" in Africa.
Joining the celebration was Professor Lin Zhanxi. Since the 1980s, the octogenarian scientist has led a research team on Juncao technology in China's southeastern Fujian Province. The hybrid grass technology enables fungi to grow on grass-based substrates instead of felled trees, a solution to the mushroom industry's threat to forests.
The plant's name means ""mushroom"" and ""grass"" in Chinese. Its versatility is a key feature, allowing it to grow edible mushrooms, provide livestock feed and help battle desertification.
Thanks to the active and visionary promotion by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Juncao is thriving in and beyond China, improving livelihoods and fostering sustainable development in developing nations across the Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America.
A WAY OUT OF POVERTY
Before known as ""the father of Juncao,"" Lin grew up in the impoverished rural mountains of Fujian. His personal experiences with poverty profoundly shaped his commitment to Juncao technology.
After decades of work, Lin and his team succeeded in selecting and breeding a type of high-yield, drought and salinity-resistant herbaceous plant that can be used as a substitute for wood to grow edible and medicinal mushrooms.
At the ninth Aid-for-Trade Global Review Conference held by the WTO in Geneva in June, Lin reflected on how Juncao technology began its global journey. It was back in 1992 when Lin first presented Juncao to widespread acclaim at an international exhibition on inventions, also in Geneva. There in Switzerland, Lin received many calls to learn more about the technology.
Lin recalled how Xi has passionately supported using scientific and technological means to combat poverty.
In 1997, Xi, then deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China Fujian Provincial Committee, listed Juncao technology as part of the province's poverty reduction efforts with the northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Upon receiving the assignment, Lin immediately took his team, as well as grass and fungus seeds, to Xihaigu, a poverty-stricken region in Ningxia.
Today, Juncao technology is used in 31 provinces across China and has significantly contributed to ending poverty and revitalizing rural areas.

With Xi's support, a pilot project to introduce Juncao technology in Papua New Guinea was launched in 2000, becoming one of the first applications of Juncao technology overseas.
Fuelled by their dedication and pioneering spirit, Lin and other Chinese researchers have since introduced the technology to 106 countries and regions across the globe.
With a mission to end poverty around the world, Chinese scientists have applied Juncao technology to some challenging environments. In Papua New Guinea's Eastern Highlands, they witnessed tribes still practicing slash-and-burn agriculture. In Rwanda, families without access to cattle or tractors labored in muddy fields using only hoes. In the Central African Republic, they observed the devastating impact of post-conflict famine.
Throughout these years, Lin has faced gunpoint robberies, malaria, altitude sickness and long periods in remote outposts without electricity or water. Witnessing extreme poverty in developing countries further strengthened Lin's commitment to Juncao.
""We go to the poorest places with a genuine intent to help the people,"" Lin stated.
A PLANT OF PROSPERITY
Agnes Ayinkamiye is the first coordinator of the Juncao project in Rwanda.
""One of the things that made me especially happy was how we helped people. The project was well-received, and we trained many people, particularly women's cooperatives and youth groups,"" she said. ""I enjoyed my work immensely and was thrilled to collaborate with experts.""
""People can earn money through Juncao technology, and it's become quite popular,"" Ayinkamiye added.
Lin noted that around 4,000 Rwandan households have benefited from the technology, with some experiencing their incomes double or even triple over the years.

""Juncao technology is affordable ... This technology is applied in such a way that makes it affordable for people at a very local level, which I believe is the key benefit,"" said Earle Courtenay Rattray, chef de cabinet to the United Nations Secretary-General.
Seruwaia Kabukabu, an entrepreneur in Serea Village of Fiji's Naitasiri Province, is one of the women trained at the Juncao demonstration center in Nadi, Fiji's third-largest city.
""After the training, every one of us received mushroom substrate bags for free from the center. Under the guidance of technical experts, we began to harvest and sell mushrooms within 7-10 days, earning money for our family,"" Kabukabu said.
The income from the Juncao project allowed her to improve her family's living standards by purchasing essential appliances, building a concrete toilet and bathroom, and even contributing to a clean water project in her community.
""Fiji faces numerous problems ranging from geographical isolation, susceptibility to natural disasters due to climate change that hinders agricultural, and sustainable development and food security,"" Kabukabu said.
Over the past decade, over 2,400 people in Fiji have received training on Juncao technology, with the Juncao cultivation area in Fiji exceeding 2,000 hectares.
""Simple to learn and effective to implement,"" said Lin, emphasizing that Juncao technology should lower its technical application threshold abroad ""so that even the poorest farmers can get involved.""
To date, nearly 350 international workshops have trained over 14,000 people in Juncao technology, with introductory papers now available in 18 languages for global use.
NEVER-ENDING EXPERIMENT
Apart from cultivating mushrooms, Juncao technology has continued to innovate, expanding its production to include feed and fertilizer.
Since using Juncao as fodder, Tahiya Massawe, a farmer in Bumbwi Sudi, Tanzania, has observed improved milk density and nutrition and increased milk production.
""It has also saved money for me,"" she told Xinhua, ""because the budget I previously spent on other feed is now saved by using this grass.""
Farmers multiply Juncao and use it on their farms. Many testimonials show that farmers have accepted the technology simply because the feeds are rich, said Makame Kitwana, director of Planning, Policy and Research at Tanzania's agriculture ministry.
""In a number of ways, scientifically, it has (been proven) that the protein content, as well as carbon content, is high, making cattle more satisfied when consuming Juncao grass compared to other grasses,"" he said.

Juncao can also help with ecological management.
Soil erosion has been a serious problem in countries such as Rwanda. Rwandan officials used to worry that if the soil problem could not be resolved, Rwanda would have no land to cultivate. Lin always kept their concerns in mind.
He still remembers the experimental data in Rwanda during his visit over a decade ago. On one day the rainfall for two and a half hours reached 51.4 millimeters. All the rain was captured by the giant (Juncao) grass, and it was very effective in water conservation and soil retention.
In February in Fiji, Lin also worked on applying Juncao technology to saline soil management, aiming to seek additional solutions to combat climate change for developing countries, including Pacific island nations.
""The experimental results were very promising,"" Lin said. ""Juncao is the grass of happiness, a gift from China to all.""

Chinese researchers invent new material for solid lithium batteries,2024-08-27,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0827/c90000-20210766.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers invent new material for solid lithium batteries
 (Xinhua) 09:25, August 27, 2024
QINGDAO, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have created a new cathode material to increase the cycle-life of all-solid-state lithium batteries, potentially improving their viability for commercial applications.
The research was recently published in the journal Nature Energy.
The research team from Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained to Xinhua on Monday that all-solid-state lithium batteries using solid electrolytes are less likely to leak and burn than conventional liquid lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in electric vehicles, mobile phones and computers.
According to Ju Jiangwei, a Ph.D. from QIBEBT and the corresponding author of the research, their new creation empowered all-solid-state lithium batteries with high conductivity, high specific discharge capacity, small volume change, high energy density, and long cycle life compared with previous solid lithium batteries.
This new homogeneous cathode material, which will enable solid lithium batteries to have higher safety and superior performance, has not yet been named.
Ju said the new material achieves over 1,000 times the electronic and ionic conductivity of traditional battery cathode materials. It can smoothly undergo charge and discharge cycles without conductive additives, which simplifies the battery preparation process and also improves the performance of the all-solid-state lithium battery.
Ju also stressed that the new material's 1.2 percent volume change during charge and discharge is more conducive to maintaining the stability of the battery structure than the traditional material, which has a volume change of over 2.6 percent. Even after 5,000 charge and discharge cycles, the new material battery still retains 80 percent of its initial capacity.
The research also mentioned that the new material battery's energy density of up to 390 watt-hours per kilogram reflects a longer battery life, 1.3 times that of the most advanced lithium-ion batteries on the market.
All-solid-state lithium batteries have a huge market in the direction of power batteries, and their successful commercialization will provide strong momentum for the national new energy automobile industry and low-altitude economy.
According to the research team, all-solid-state lithium batteries are a new generation of energy storage technology that can store electricity from wind and solar energy. These batteries can help achieve China's ""dual carbon"" strategic goals, actively promote the green and low-carbon transformation of China's economy and society, and drive green technology innovation and industrial development.
The new material's parent material was initially noticed in an article published by Nobel Prize winner John Bannister Goodenough in 2008. The research team found it would have the potential for excellent ionic conductivity. Due to its complex elemental composition, it took the team two years to synthesize this parent material.
""Contrary to our expectations, the ionic conductivity of this material is low, while the electronic conductivity is high. Therefore, we first improved the ionic conductivity by doping it with germanium, then tried to enhance the electronic conductivity by replacing sulfur with selenium, and finally obtained the new material,"" Ju said.
The research team also found that replacing germanium with cheap and abundant silicon can greatly reduce the battery's cost and contribute to the commercialization of all-solid-state lithium batteries.
""We are currently preparing this material in small batches and expect to achieve large-scale production in two to three years. In terms of cost, we hope to develop a new material with less lithium in the future. If successful, the cost of sulfide solid-state lithium batteries can be reduced to 30 percent of that of liquid lithium batteries,"" Ju added.
Ju noted the research team will also focus on the recycling of all-solid-state lithium batteries in future research.

Recently, a research team from a Chinese university successfully sent samples of soybean bacteria to the nation's Tiangong Space Station via the Tianzhou-6 cargo spacecraft. The project is the first Hong Kong agricultural research project to be launched into space, opening a new chapter for the integration of aerospace and agricultural technology.
""The experiment although small in the grand scheme of scientific research, for our research team in Hong Kong, represents a significant milestone that will pave the way for advancements in agricultural technology. Being part of this esteemed space experiment provides us with the opportunity to showcase our research capability on a national level,"" said Hong Kong-based biologist Lam Hon Ming.

Lam, the project's chief scientist, told the Global Times that the experiment represents a significant achievement in agricultural innovation in Hong Kong, while also fostering collaboration between scientific communities in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. ""We are proud to be contributing to such groundbreaking and important scientific endeavors.""
According to Lam, the experiment aims to discover how soybean seeds and nitrogen-fixing bacteria mutate in space conditions, opening the door to new advances in agricultural technology that could make soybean farming more resilient to climate change.
Lam and his team are currently studying analysis of the specimens on their return to explore how their mutation mechanisms behave in space and hope that could offer valuable knowledge for potential applications in space agriculture, such as cultivating crops on other celestial bodies or in space stations.
""Perhaps, in the future, we can explore the possibility of cultivating soybeans in extraterrestrial environments such as Mars, the Moon, and outer space,"" he said.
Lam is also a director of the State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a national-level research team approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.
He said the project could also contribute to the country's overall food security. The key to the development of China's agricultural sector lies in harnessing the power of science and technology, given that 80 percent of the country's demand is currently imported because of a shortage of arable land, Lam noted.
""Our long-term vision is to combine China's most advanced aerospace technology with the most important food security research, use space projects to promote close ties between Hong Kong and the mainland, and establish an international innovation and technology hub that engages with the world,"" Lam said.
Limited land resources and technological gaps in China's soybean industry have led to lower productivity levels when compared to the United States. However, as China continues to invest in research and development, the gap between China and the US in soybean production is expected to narrow, paving the way for a more competitive agricultural sector in the future.
Working on soybean research for more than two decades, Lam is committed to promoting sustainable agricultural development through his research. Through the identification and characterization of key genes from elite germplasms that may enhance adaption to biotic and abiotic stresses, Lam envisions integrating cutting-edge academic technology with traditional knowledge from farmers to promote sustainable agriculture.
In 2014, his team successfully identified and cloned a salt-tolerant gene from wild soybeans, which paved the way to improving agriculture on marginal lands. Lam also collaborated with scientists in Northwest China's Gansu Province and successfully developed three new stress-tolerance soybean cultivars called Longhuang 1, Longhuang 2, and Longhuang 3, with traits such as high-yield, high-quality, and high tolerance for salt and drought.
From 2016 to 2023, the soybeans were planted in an area spanning approximately 1.18 million mu(78,667 hectares) in Gansu, delivering an additional income of 97 million yuan ($13.6 million) to local farmers.
Recalling his partnership with his Gansu counterpart Zhang Guohong, which has yielded fruitful results, Lam said ""There is significant potential to grow our business in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.""
""With its large population, thriving agricultural market, and advanced food processing technology, the Greater Bay Area offers numerous opportunities for our products. By establishing a sustainable ecosystem that encompasses production, processing, and sales in this region, we can drive economic growth and create a model for sustainable agricultural development,"" Lam said.

BEIJING, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Wrapping sushi rice up with his nimble hands, a silver-haired ""master chef"" leaned over the sushi counter and focused on his craft with visible dedication. In front of him, the conveyor belt is overflowing with aromatic tuna sushi and delectable sushi rolls, taking visitors on an immersive journey to an authentic sushi bar nestled in a Tokyo neighborhood.
But in reality, the visitors were surrounded by legions of humanoid robots, including the ""master chef"" himself. These robots, with their strikingly lifelike appearances, featured clearly visible wrinkles on their faces and veins under their ""skin,"" blurring the line between human and machine.
Such vivid scenes are no longer limited to flashy demo clips but are now part of a demonstration by EX-Robots, a Dalian-based leading company in China's robotics industry. Here, many of these humanoid robots have moved beyond sleek, futuristic designs to astonishingly human-like forms, fostering a more natural and relaxed atmosphere for human-robot interaction.
According to Li Boyang, co-founder and CEO of the company, the key lies in their enhanced facial expressions and the ability to foster an emotional connection with users.
""In terms of core technologies, our unique features include the robot's intelligent facial expressions and its dexterous hands. Our algorithms focus on multimodal large models that enhance emotional and perceptual capabilities, as well as intelligent decision-making and human-like interaction abilities, such as speech, facial expressions and gestures,"" Li said.
Li further highlighted that the company is committed to improving how robots understand and respond to human emotions, particularly during conversations and when reading aloud. This research is part of a broader effort to advance robots' cognitive abilities, specifically their skills in recognizing facial expressions and emotional cues.
Currently, EX-Robots produces between 400 and 500 units annually, primarily used in museums and educational institutions. However, the company anticipates that as production costs decrease, there will be broader applications for its robots in many fields.
Looking ahead, many industry insiders including Li believe humanoid robots with emotional interaction capabilities will play a larger role in sectors including healthcare and education, with potential applications in psychological counseling and health management.
China, a major global player in the humanoid robot sector and the world's largest market for robot applications, is seeing an increasing focus on deploying robots in scenarios that require emotional interaction. Companies including EX-Robots are at the forefront of this movement, pushing the boundaries of what robots can do.

In addition to corporate advancements, academic research is also contributing to the field.
A research team led by Liu Xiaofeng, a professor at Hohai University in Jiangsu Province, has introduced a new algorithm for generating facial expressions on humanoid robots. Their findings, detailed in the July issue of IEEE Transactions on Robotics, present a novel approach to action unit (AU)-driven facial expression synthesis.
Thanks to advanced AI models, robots can now understand human language and the emotions conveyed through tone, and they can interact through speech. However, Liu noted that creating appropriate facial expressions while ""speaking"" remains a significant challenge for humanoid robots.
To address this challenge, according to Ni Rongrong, a co-author from Changzhou University, the team divided the nine motors on the humanoid robot's face into 17 AUs to enable richer expressions and smoother transitions through coordinated movements.
""Each unit is like a letter, and by combining different letters, we form words,"" Ni explained.
Liu envisions that as emotional interaction capabilities improve, these robots will increasingly be used in settings such as nursing homes, kindergartens, and special education schools, where both high emotional and intellectual engagement are valuable.
However, at the just-concluded 2024 World Robot Conference in Beijing, feedback from the audience has been mixed. Some visitors expressed enthusiasm for robotic companions, while others voiced concerns.
Standing by an array of humanoid robots mimicking human speech, with their cheeks fluctuating rhythmically, a visitor surnamed Lyu described the scene as ""a little bit creepy."" ""I know the cause may be the uncanny valley effect, but I just can't imagine enjoying emotional interaction with them,"" she added.
Adding to the discussion, Ren Lei, a professor at Jilin University, said that current humanoid robots have yet to achieve a perfect blend of form and essence. ""They only simulate human appearance but fall short in mimicking human essence. Their agility, dexterity, and precision cannot compare to those of humans. Due to these functional limitations, many humanoid robots still lack practical applications and are far from being fully implemented in real-world scenarios.""

AI-powered system assists Hebei nature reserve in protecting birds,2024-08-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0826/c90000-20210320.html,"Home>>
		
AI-powered system assists Hebei nature reserve in protecting birds
By Zhang Yu (China Daily) 10:20, August 26, 2024
As a bird flew over a nature reserve in North China's Hebei province on Friday, its beautiful song was immediately recorded and its species identified using a special system.
""It's a reed parrotbill, constantly emitting short and sharp chirping sounds,"" said Zhang Jingxing, a staff member at the Nandagang Wetland and Bird Nature Reserve in the Huanghua area of the city of Cangzhou.
Zhang learned via an artificial intelligence monitoring platform on his computer that the bird species was roosting at the reserve, and he could see a list of birds whose songs were recorded and the sounds of each.
""By 4 pm on Friday, the system had recorded 88 sounds from 37 bird species,"" Zhang said.
Since the system began operation in 2021, it has identified 197 different species, he added.
According to Zhang, the AI vocal monitoring system collects bird sounds using unmanned, specially equipped monitoring boats in reed marshes, and real-time sound data is analyzed by AI to record bird activity and analyze species distribution.
""By automatically comparing them with 1,569 bird call types in the system, bird species can be identified,"" he said, adding that the system also records images of birds in motion, which together with the sounds are used to identify bird species.
""This effectively addresses the limitations of traditional monitoring methods, improving monitoring efficiency and data accuracy,"" Zhang said.
Last year, with AI technology, the reserve recorded the black-faced spoonbill, an endangered species with only a few thousand remaining worldwide, demonstrating the important role of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, Zhang said.
""It has helped enhance bird conservation efforts through technology,"" he said.
Zhang said his work is becoming more meaningful because the Nandagang Migratory Bird Habitat was included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list as part of the migratory bird sanctuaries along the coast of the Yellow Sea-Bohai Gulf area of China.
The decision was made during the 46th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which was held in New Delhi, India, last month.
There are four other newly included sites as part of Phase II sanctuaries. Phase I sanctuaries were added to the World Heritage list in 2019.
The bird habitat in Nandagang has a total area of 3,810.6 hectares, accounting for 50.8 percent of the total area of the Nandagang Wetland and Bird Nature Reserve.
""The reserve belongs to a typical coastal wetland type, with the most intact marsh wetland ecosystem preserved in the (Bohai Gulf) ecological zone,"" said Zhang Jianguo, director of the Nature Reserve Management Office of Hebei's Forestry and Grassland Bureau.
More than 100,000 migratory birds were recorded in the reserve last year, compared with 20,000 in 2019. ""The increase in the number of birds is closely related to the conservation efforts carried out in the reserve,"" he said.
In recent years, a natural wetland ecosystem has been gradually restored.

BEIJING, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- At the ongoing 2024 World Robot Conference in Beijing, a stage no stranger to astonishing innovations in the sector, robots driven by artificial intelligence (AI) are not only stealing the spotlight once again but also underscoring their game-changing impact on the industry.
Amid the array of AI-powered robotic technologies dazzling eager audiences and professional attendees, Unitree G1, a two-legged humanoid robot standing about 1.3 meters tall and weighing approximately 35 kg, garnered much attention.
While its sleek, streamlined design and polished, futuristic appearance captured many eyes, the robot's appeal to potential buyers mainly lies in its integrated robot unified large model, enabling it to develop and refine its skills continuously.
This robot also stands out with several other noteworthy features. According to its developer, Unitree, a Hangzhou-based robotics startup, the humanoid robot can move at 2 meters per second and features advanced three-finger force control hands, with a maximum knee joint torque of 120 Newton meters.
""This model, launched this year, starts at just 99,000 yuan (about 13,874 U.S. dollars) and has already been adopted by numerous laboratories and companies,"" said Huang Jiawei, marketing director at Unitree.
Many industry insiders see humanoid robots and general AI as the zenith of global technological innovation, marking a new frontier for future industries and a fresh engine for economic growth. Breakthroughs in AI have become a crucial driving force behind the advancement of humanoid robots, and the world is witnessing a surge in the integration of humanoid robots with general AI.
In China, a major global player in both humanoid robots and AI sectors, the practical application of these robots is evolving rapidly. No longer just performing flashy tricks, advanced AI-powered robots are increasingly being integrated into industrial settings, working alongside humans.
At the event, UBTECH Robotics, a leading robotics firm based in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, showcased robots performing tasks such as intelligent transportation, quality inspection, and chemical handling on automotive production lines.

This year, the company's humanoid robots have already been deployed at major car manufacturers like Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor, Geely Auto, and FAW, marking a significant step toward large-scale application in manufacturing.
""AI models have greatly accelerated the development of humanoid robots,"" said UBTECH Humanoid Robot Motion Control Algorithm Lead Greg Ge. ""Currently, humanoid robots in car factories operate at about 20 percent of human efficiency, but we expect that figure to reach nearly 100 percent within the next one to two years. Robots can work 24/7, which means their overall efficiency will surpass that of humans.""
Speaking with Xinhua, Ge envisions a future where AI-driven humanoid robots and humans work together more frequently, particularly in dangerous environments or requiring heavy labor. In his view, humanoid robots will increasingly integrate into human life, whether assisting in daily tasks or providing services in a friendly and interactive manner.
Another big hitter at this year's event is the embodied AI robot ""Tiangong,"" which captivated audiences by engaging in conversations, receiving and responding to voice commands, and grasping and placing objects in designated locations. This capability is powered by a large visual-language model trained on an embodied AI platform, ensuring the robot's understanding of various situational tasks.
Che Zhiping, Embodied AI Team Leader of the Beijing Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robotics Innovation Center (or HUMANOID), the developer of ""Tiangong,"" explained that the concept of ""embodied AI"" can be understood as an ""AI with a physical form.""
This concept enables better interaction between the digital and physical worlds. In future everyday scenarios, whether dining out or shopping, humanoid robots will increasingly integrate into human life, offering both a friendly presence and practical assistance, Che added.
According to Kong Lei, director of the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area Administrative Committee, the area, as the permanent home of the World Robot Conference, aims to establish a production capacity of more than 10,000 embodied AI robots by the end of 2026.
""In the 55 years since the first humanoid robot was introduced in 1969, there has never been a moment closer to making the dream a reality,"" said Xiong Youjun, general manager of HUMANOID. ""AI has ushered in the 'iPhone moment' for humanoid robots.""

Researchers develop novel deep learning model to predict battery lifetime
 (Xinhua) 15:46, August 24, 2024
SHENYANG, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have proposed a new type of deep learning model to predict the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), according to a recent article published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification.
The deep learning model effectively eliminated the dependence on a large amount of charging test data and provided a new idea for predicting battery life in real-time.
The article noted that the accurate lifetime prediction of LIBs is essential to the normal and effective operation of electric devices. However, such estimation faces huge challenges due to the nonlinear capacity degradation process and uncertain operating conditions of LIBs.
The researchers from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Xi'an Jiaotong University proposed a deep learning model based on a small amount of charge cycle data to predict the target battery's current cycle life and remaining useful life.
The learning model can accurately predict the battery's current cycle life and remaining service life using only 15 charge cycle data. According to the experiment results, this data can make an accurate prediction.
The proposed model is expected to provide a solution for intelligent battery management, said Chen Zhongwei, the director of the State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, DICP.

Made-in-China robots venturing out from labs to daily life,2024-08-24,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0824/c90000-20210045.html,"Home>>
		
Made-in-China robots venturing out from labs to daily life
 (Xinhua) 14:51, August 24, 2024
HANGZHOU, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- While robot dogs are making their way onto battlefields in some countries, in China, they are transitioning from labs and expos to everyday life.
At east China's Zhejiang University, a robot dog was spotted effortlessly carrying a freshman's 20 kilograms of luggage, swiftly navigating through crowds and climbing stairs.
""When I arrived here, I saw the robot dog navigate obstacles independently. It was my first experience seeing how a robot dog can serve people,"" said Huang Weichao, a freshman majoring in robotics engineering.
Two such robot dogs were deployed to assist freshmen with their luggage on the first day of registration. The X30 quadruped robot, developed by a team from Zhejiang University and DEEP Robotics, a leading quadrupedal robot developer, was officially launched in October 2023.
The robot dog is approximately 1 meter long, 50 centimeters tall when standing, and weighs about 56 kilograms. It is the result of two generations of robot dog iterations launched in 2019 and 2021, according to Chen Shenhong, head of the research and development team.
""The biggest feature of the X30 is its ability to operate in temperatures ranging from minus 20 to 55 degrees Celsius. It can navigate and function autonomously in extreme environments, whether in dim light, bright light, or complete darkness, with a range of over 10 kilometers. It has been widely used in power inspections, emergency rescue missions, and police patrols,"" Chen said.
China has become the world's largest market for robot applications. In recent years, the rapid growth of the country's robotics industry has led to the deployment of robots across various sectors, including warehouse logistics, education and entertainment, cleaning services, security inspection, and medical rehabilitation.
Humanoid robots are transitioning from labs and expos to workshops in China. For instance, in an automotive factory, silver humanoid robots stride along assembly lines, performing tasks once carried out exclusively by humans, such as car scanning, seatbelt inspection and affixing labels to vehicles.
This advancement is the result of a collaboration between UBTECH, a Shenzhen-based robotics firm, and Chinese electric carmaker NIO, underscoring the rapid progress in China's humanoid robot industry.
Last month, UBTECH announced its plans to work with FAW-Volkswagen, one of China's earliest joint venture automakers, to develop an unmanned car factory. This cooperation aims to deploy UBTECH's industrial humanoid robot, Walker S, at FAW-Volkswagen's plant in east China's Qingdao, where the robot will undertake tasks such as bolt tightening, component assembly, and handling automotive parts.
Pang Jianxin, vice president of UBTECH, said that humanoid robots are increasingly penetrating critical sectors of the manufacturing industry, including automobiles, computers, communications, and consumer electronics. He noted that China's robust industrial base provides fertile ground for humanoid robot development.
An industrial report co-compiled by UBTECH and other partners predicts that the market size of humanoid robots in China will reach around 2.76 billion yuan in 2024 and is expected to reach 75 billion yuan by 2029, accounting for about a third of the global total. By 2035, the market is projected to expand even further, with a potential size of 300 billion yuan (about 42 billion U.S. dollars).
""Datou A Liang,"" a robot designed by Jiangsu Aiyuwencheng Elderly Care Robot Co. Ltd., stole the spotlight at the International Exhibition of Senior Care, Rehabilitation Medicine and Healthcare held in Shanghai this June, with visitors calling it exactly the robot they had been seeking.
The company's robots sold out rapidly at the exhibition, where they engaged with over 30 potential partners and secured orders from Japan and Europe.
""It's like hiring a housekeeper with fall detection who can stay within sight of the elderly at all times,"" said a technician from the company, noting that besides assisting with medication and meals, the robot can also facilitate video calls with their relatives.
Beyond providing life care and health monitoring, future robots are expected to serve as emotional companions for the elderly. They will be equipped with natural language processing capabilities to communicate fluently, listen attentively, and share in their joys and sorrows.
The humanoid robots are expected to usher in a blue ocean market. Data from Goldman Sachs indicate that the global market size of humanoid robots will reach 154 billion U.S. dollars by 2035.
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a guideline last year identifying humanoid robot development as a promising future industry. The sector integrates cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, high-end manufacturing and new materials.
By 2027, China will see a secure and reliable industrial and supply chain system, and related products will be deeply integrated into the real economy, according to the guideline.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- Scientists with NASA's Juno mission have developed the first complete 3D radiation map of the Jupiter system, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
Along with characterizing the intensity of the high-energy particles near the orbit of the icy moon Europa, the map shows how the radiation environment is sculpted by the smaller moons orbiting near Jupiter's rings, said JPL in a report earlier this week.
The work relies on data collected by Juno's Advanced Stellar Compass (ASC), which was designed and built by the Technical University of Denmark, and the spacecraft's Stellar Reference Unit, which was built by Leonardo SpA in Florence, Italy.
The two datasets helped Juno scientists characterize the radiation environment at different energies, according to JPL.
Consisting of four star cameras on the spacecraft's magnetometer boom, Juno's ASC takes images of stars to determine the spacecraft's orientation in space.
ASC data suggested that there is more very high-energy radiation relative to lower-energy radiation near Europa's orbit than previously thought, according to JPL.
The data also confirmed that there are more high-energy electrons on the side of Europa facing its orbital direction of motion than on the moon's trailing side, said JPL.

One ton of lunar soil could produce 50 kilograms of water: Chinese scientists,2024-08-23,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0823/c90000-20209423.html,"Home>>
		
One ton of lunar soil could produce 50 kilograms of water: Chinese scientists
 (Global Times) 10:05, August 23, 2024

With a newly discovered method to produce water on the moon, it is estimated that 50 kilograms of water can be extracted from one ton of lunar soil. Chinese scientists said it is expected to provide new ideas for the construction of lunar research stations and space stations in the future.
After three years of research and experimentation, a scientific research team made up of researchers from the institutions of Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology & Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and the Institute of Physics, CAS has recently achieved the new discovery using the lunar soil samples taken back by the Chang’e-5 lunar landing mission.
As a crucial resource for building lunar research stations and supporting future interplanetary or lunar travel, water is essential for human survival in space. Searching for water resources is one of the primary tasks of lunar exploration.
In the past, scientists focused mainly on the distribution of natural water resources in its natural state on the moon. Earlier researches indicated that small amounts of water are contained in a variety of lunar soil minerals such as glass materials, plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene. Meanwhile, the water content in these minerals is extremely low – a proportion of less than 0.02 percent, it is difficult to utilize these mineral resources to extract water on the moon.
Therefore, researching and developing new methods for extracting lunar water resources is a key focus of future lunar exploration missions
Following in-depth researches and repeated experimentation, scientists have discovered that lunar soil minerals have stored a large amount of hydrogen elements due to billions of years of solar wind irradiation.
When heated to high temperatures, hydrogen will undergo the oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction with the iron oxides in the minerals, producing elemental iron and a large amount of water.
Lunar soil will be melted when heated to a temperature of 1,000 C with water produced by the reaction in the soil to be released in the form of steam.
After various experiments and technical analyses, the research team have found that one gram of lunar soil can produce approximately 51 milligrams to 76 milligrams of water.
Based on this calculation, one ton of lunar soil can produce approximately 51 kilograms to 76 kilograms of water, equivalent to the amount of over 100 bottles of bottled water of 500 milliliters each, which can meet the needs of 50 people each day.
Through further researches on different lunar minerals, the research team discovered that when heated, ilmenite, a natural mineral composed mainly of iron and titanium oxides, can simultaneously produce a large amount of elemental iron and water vapor bubbles, constituting a true “reservoir” on the moon.
Based on multiple researches, the team has proposed a feasible strategy for extracting and utilizing lunar water resources on the moon.
First, a concave mirror or Fresnel lens can be used to focus solar light to heat and melt lunar soil and produce water, elemental iron, and ceramic glass.
The water vapor generated during the process can be condensed into water of liquid form, which can be collected and stored in tanks and meet the demands of humans, various plants, and animals on the moon.
Oxygen and hydrogen can be generated from water by electrolysis. Oxygen can be used by human beings for respiration and hydrogen can be used as a source of energy.
Iron can be used to manufacture permanent magnets and soft magnetic materials, providing raw materials for power electronics devices. Iron can also be used as a building material.
Melted lunar soil can also be used to produce bricks with mortise and tenon joints which can be used for constructing bases on the moon, researchers said.
Experts said that this strategy will provide important references to the construction of future lunar research stations and space stations. The strategy is expected to be further validated through the deployment of verification equipment on the moon in future Chang’e lunar exploration missions.
Researchers from the Institute of Physics of, CAS, along with scholars from several renowned Chinese universities, discovered ULM-1, an unidentified mineral crystal enriched with water molecules and ammonium on the moon from the Chang’e-5 lunar samples, a breakthrough that indicates that for the first time, molecular water was found in lunar soil, the Xinhua News Agency reported in July.
To date, researchers studying the lunar samples brought back by the Chang’e-5 mission have accomplished a number of milestone achievements with over 70 findings being published in major academic journals both at home and abroad.

BEIJING, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Showing off all kinds of human-like interactions and skills, such as making heart gestures and winking at the audience, as well as cooking meals and performing calligraphy, 27 different humanoid robots have become the most buzz-worthy exhibits at the ongoing 2024 World Robot Conference in Beijing.
Over the years, global powerhouses of technology and innovation have competed fiercely to roll out human-like robot products and accelerated their iteration. The global market for humanoid robots is expected to hit 154 billion U.S. dollars by 2035, investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts.
Leveraging the advantages in its industry chain, consumption scenarios, databases and policy support, China is growing into an active force that cannot be ignored in the global industry of humanoid robots.
For a long time before 2022, China's humanoid robot industry remained at the stage of basic research and technology accumulation, and the leading products were mostly small robots for education, along with a modest number of full-size humanoid robots for experiments, exhibitions or performances.
However, starting in 2023, the industry entered its breakout period, with the industrial scale surging to 3.91 billion yuan (about 549 million U.S. dollars), up 85.7 percent year on year, according to research on the ecological development of the Chinese humanoid robot industry issued this year by the China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) under China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).
Early last month, the 5G smart factory of Chinese electric vehicle brand Zeekr welcomed its new ""employees"" -- the industrial humanoid robot Walker S Lite developed by UBTECH Robotics Corp., Ltd., a leading robotics firm based in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province. With a maximum load of 15 kg, Walker S Lite can assist workers in carrying work bins.
The 5G smart factory is the fourth automobile plant that UBTECH has cooperated with this year. Previously, the company's humanoid robot Walker S had been integrated into industrial operations at the factories of Chinese electric carmaker NIO, Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor and FAW-Volkswagen.
Industry insiders said that 2024 is expected to become a key year for humanoid robots to venture out of labs into workshops.
""China boasts a large enough market and the world's best industrial supply chain, which is very conducive to the large-scale production of cost-effective products,"" said Jiao Jichao, vice president of UBTECH.
Data from Qichacha, a business data platform in China, shows that the country is now home to nearly 720,000 robot-related businesses. Among them, more than 20 enterprises are now producing complete humanoid robot products.
China has gained a first-mover advantage in the humanoid robot market that is basically consistent with developed countries, said Zhong Xinlong, an AI expert at CCID Consulting, a think tank under the MIIT.

As of July, China had more than 190,000 effective robot-related patents, accounting for about two-thirds of the world's total, Xin Guobin, vice minister of the MIIT, said at the 2024 World Robot Conference. A report released by a research institute under People.cn last year showed that China has taken a lead in humanoid robot technology worldwide, ranking first in the number of patent applications and valid patents.
As enterprises forge ahead on the new track of humanoid robots, the country has beefed up policy support for industrial development. China aims to establish a preliminary innovation system for humanoid robots by 2025, according to a guideline from the MIIT. By 2027, the country will see a secure and reliable industrial and supply chain system, and related products will be deeply integrated into the real economy.
Under policy guidance, various regions across the country are accelerating their efforts in the humanoid robot industry.
At the end of last year, China's first innovation center focused on core technologies, product development and application ecosystems for humanoid robots -- the Beijing Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robotics Innovation Center, or HUMANOID -- was established in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area.
Platforms like HUMANOID will share common breakthrough achievements with the whole industry, so that more enterprises can ""stand on the shoulders of giants,"" which is conducive to the rapid development of the industry as a whole, said Xiong Youjun, the center's general manager.
Since the beginning of this year, manufacturing provinces such as Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui and Sichuan have caught up by establishing innovation centers featuring industry-university-research-application integration.
""With the collaborative innovation of all parties, as well as the accelerated gathering of policy, capital and other factors, China's humanoid robot industry will also enter a period of active innovation,"" said Wang Jianing, a tech investment expert. ""On the one hand, breakthroughs in core technologies are being made constantly, and on the other hand, the industry is also actively exploring a commercialization path suited to national conditions.""
Experts forecast that the humanoid robot industry may usher in explosive growth in the next decade. According to a report released at the First Chinese Humanoid Robot Industry Conference in April, the market scale of the humanoid robot industry in China is predicted to reach 75 billion yuan by 2029, accounting for 32.7 percent of the world's total.
""With continuous accumulation, iteration and optimization, we are confident that we can accelerate alongside the global humanoid robot industry and excel in the sector,"" said Jiao.
