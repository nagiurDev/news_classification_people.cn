PESCARA, Italy/GUIYANG, China, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) located in southwest China's Guizhou Province has yielded significant scientific results and created a new avenue for astronomical collaboration between China and European countries in recent years.
Li Di, a Chinese radio astronomer and chief scientist of FAST, received the Marcel Grossmann Award on Tuesday from the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics Network (ICRANet), becoming the first Chinese scientist to be awarded this prestigious international award in physics.
Li, a researcher from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), was awarded the prize for his groundbreaking contributions to the scientific capabilities of the world's most sensitive radio telescope, including precise measurements of interstellar magnetic fields and advancing the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to a high statistical significance, according to the committee of the 17th Marcel Grossmann Meeting underway in Pescara, Italy.
Remo Ruffini, director of ICRANet, said that he has been collaborating with China and admiring the fantastic work Li has been able to create with FAST. He hopes to enhance collaboration in the future.
The FRBs are the brightest millisecond-duration astronomical transients in radio bands with yet unknown origins. Less than 5 percent of those ever detected have been seen to repeat, and only a few are persistently active.
Li said that the study of FRBs holds the opportunity for significant breakthroughs in understanding the mechanisms of extreme energy production and transport in the universe.
Currently, FAST has detected the greatest number of bursting events, making epoch-making contributions to the FRB field, he added.
Located in a naturally deep and round karst depression in Guizhou, FAST was completed in 2016 and started formal operations in 2020.
Since its opening, FAST has attracted researchers from many European countries, including Italy. With its high sensitivity, FAST provides astronomers with a powerful tool for studying various cosmic objects, including pulsars in globular clusters, and some of the most ancient celestial bodies in the Milky Way.
Renowned experts Paulo Freire from the Max Planck Institute in Germany, and Alessandro Ridolfi from the Cagliari Astronomical Observatory of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, have both collaborated with Chinese scientists in exploring globular cluster pulsars using the FAST telescope and have discovered new pulsars with special properties.
Ridolfi led the development and optimization of various pulsar data processing software, including pulsar observation data compression, search, and timing observations, contributing to a series of discoveries in globular clusters.
In 2022, Ridolfi received funding from the CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative. He assisted astronomers from China's National Astronomical Observatories in using the FAST telescope to explore globular cluster pulsars, leading to the discovery of pulsars with special properties.
""These new discoveries not only enrich our understanding of globular clusters but also provide valuable samples for future research and promote international exchange and cooperation through FAST,"" said Li, expecting more exciting discoveries with FAST in the future through international cooperation.
China, as a founding member of the intergovernmental international radio telescope project Square Kilometer Array (SKA), has been carrying out joint research with European countries.
Philippe Zarka, an astrophysicist at the Paris Observatory, joined colleagues from China's Peking University and Sun Yat-sen University in studying radio bursts produced by the active star AD Leonis, detected with FAST in the range 1-1.5 GHz, and took charge of the interpretation of these observations.
""With FAST, we have observed radio bursts from the star AD Leonis, not for the first time, but with the highest sensitivity and time-frequency resolutions,"" said Zarka. He added that the exquisite sensitivity and high time-frequency resolutions of FAST were instrumental in his research.
Zarka said that FAST may bring very interesting results on star-planet interactions, and he has high expectations for comparing FAST results at ~1 GHz with NenuFAR results below 100 MHz.
FAST was officially opened to the world in 2021. Sun Chun, the engineer in charge of FAST measurement and control, said that as of April 2024, FAST has received applications from 15 foreign countries, including Britain, France, and Italy, and approved a total of nearly 900 hours for observation.
""The collaboration with Chinese scientists was very nice and fruitful, and two proposals between Chinese and French scientists were submitted in response to the latest call from FAST for next year,"" said Zarka.
There is significant expertise in developing low-frequency radio arrays in Europe, and Zarka expressed hope that cooperation with China on these subjects will continue to develop.

Queqiao-2 spearheads diverse scientific exploration for future lunar missions
 (Xinhua) 11:04, July 10, 2024
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Queqiao-2 relay satellite, with three scientific payloads installed, will conduct multiple scientific exploration missions in orbit, following its earlier contribution to the Chang'e-6 mission.
Queqiao-2, or Magpie Bridge 2, was launched by a Long March-8 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Site in south China's Hainan Province on March 20 this year, with the task of providing Earth-moon communications services.
Its three payloads consist of an extreme ultraviolet camera, a two-dimensional-coded energetic neutral atom-imager and an Earth-moon very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment system, according to the National Space Science Center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
A scientific payload manager is also installed, which acts as the central control hub for the instruments, and is responsible for their unified control and data reception management, the center said.
As a crucial part of the future Chang'e-7 mission, these payloads will carry out multiple Earth observation and astrometry experiments, with an aim to advance research in space Earth science, space astronomy and deep space exploration technology, thereby creating more original scientific achievements.
According to the center, the extreme ultraviolet camera can simultaneously observe in the 30.4 nm and 83.4 nm spectral bands, capturing a series of unique ""photos"" of space around Earth.
Scientists can use these ""photos"" to study how solar activity affects Earth's space environment, understand how Earth's magnetic field protects humans from cosmic rays and the solar wind, and better predict solar activity events to avoid negative impacts on communication systems and spacecraft safety.
The two-dimensional-coded energetic neutral atom-imager, independently developed by China, can image and observe Earth's magnetosphere, obtaining high temporal and spatial resolution data of Earth's magnetotail, the center said.
It can provide observational data support for studying Earth's magnetic storm processes, substorm injection triggering mechanisms and magnetotail energy conversion mechanisms, thus enhancing the safety of the country's space station and near-Earth satellites during their operations.
The Earth-moon VLBI experiment system uses the antenna of Queqiao-2 to extend the ground-based VLBI network into the Earth-moon space, achieving a baseline length ranging from 3,000 meters to 380,000 kilometers, according to the center.
It will enable scientific exploration in astrophysics and astrometry of the Earth-moon baseline, as well as precise orbit measurements for deep space probes. Its unique perspective will unveil the physical properties and evolutionary processes of various celestial bodies and phenomena.

Chinese researchers design wristwatch for real-time health monitoring through sweat
 (Xinhua) 16:34, July 09, 2024
HEFEI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Smart wearable devices have evolved with advanced features for a holistic health and fitness experience, monitoring heart rate, tracking step count, calculating calorie intake, and now notifying users when they need electrolyte drinks during exercise with just a flick of the wrist.
Scientists from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HIPS) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences have designed a wristwatch that can measure essential chemicals in body sweat. Their findings were published in the journal ACS Nano.
Sweat contains electrolytes, primarily potassium, sodium and calcium. The balance of these essential minerals is crucial for supporting muscle function, nerve health and regular heartbeat, said Yang Meng, an associate professor at the institute and one of the authors of the study.
Sweating leads to the loss of both water and electrolytes. ""Excessive loss of potassium, for instance, can impact heart function and neuromuscular activity. Similarly, the depletion of sodium ions may result in symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness and muscle cramps,"" Yang said, explaining the importance of maintaining a balanced electrolyte level.
The wristwatch designed by Yang's team collects sweat from the skin and analyzes it in real time using a sensor chip with an ion-sensitive membrane.
When sweat enters the device, it will come into contact with the membrane that contains three tubules capable of measuring sodium, potassium and calcium levels, respectively.
Although they are not the first to invent sweat sensors, the Chinese researchers emphasized the wristwatch's solid interface for long-term reliability.
""It surpasses the stability of many other sensors by consistently monitoring the three ions in human sweat for over six months,"" said lead researcher Huang Xingjiu, of the Institute of Solid State Physics under the HIPS.
Since endurance athletes use electrolyte drinks to counteract the loss of energy and replenish it, researchers in the study measured the sweat composition of these chemicals in athletes running long distances on a treadmill.
The accuracy reached approximately 95 percent when compared to the standard detection method.
""When there are electrolyte abnormalities, the device will remind users to supplement them promptly,"" said the co-first author Cai Xin. ""The aim of developing this device is to provide warnings for electrolyte loss and reduce exercise-related injury risks.""
For ordinary people, the conventional electrolyte test requires samples of body fluids taken in hospitals. The new wristwatch has the potential to serve as an alternative to needles for measuring electrolytes.
In addition to offering a non-invasive test, the device allows for real-time monitoring of electrolytes, ""which is undoubtedly a significant advancement in human health monitoring,"" said Xu Han, a physician at the Central Hospital of Bengbu, who was not involved in the study.
The next goal of the research team is to design various sensitive membrane materials for monitoring more physiological information, such as glucose and chloride ions.
The researchers noted that compared to popular fitness watches on the market, the device they designed is larger and heavier, making it less comfortable to wear. However, they expect to develop wearable sweat sensors suitable for market applications in the next five years.
Yang said that the team of researchers also aims to adapt the device for environmental monitoring to measure heavy metals in the future.

Innovative technologies contribute to China's latest mega cross-sea link
By He Linping, Cheng Yuanzhou (People's Daily) 15:12, July 09, 2024
The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link, a mega cross-sea passage in south China, had handled 305,000 vehicles as of July 3, according to data from China's Guangdong Transportation Group.
The 24-kilometer passage was officially opened to traffic on June 30, representing the world's first cross-sea cluster project that features two bridges, two artificial islands and an underwater tunnel. Bridging Shenzhen in the east of the Pearl River Estuary with Zhongshan in the west, it has significantly reduced travel time between the two cities from about two hours to around 30 minutes.

The massive transportation project commenced construction in February 2017 and took over seven years to complete. It utilized a number of new technologies, equipment, materials, and processes, managed to overcome multiple world-class technical challenges and set multiple world records.
The link features a two-way, eight-lane tunnel that spans 6.8 kilometers under the sea, consisting of 32 immersed tubes and one final closure joint. It is the world's longest and widest underwater steel-shell concrete tunnel, also one of the most challenging projects worldwide.
Viewed from above, the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge, one of the key projects of the link, resembles the majestic backbone of a dragon.
Such magnificence meant unprecedented technological challenges met by engineers during the construction, said Song Shenyou, head of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link administration center of Guangdong Provincial Communications Group Co., Ltd., also chief engineer of the project.
According to Song, one of the primary focuses during construction is to ensure that ships can navigate in and out of the Pearl River Estuary, as the link serves as a core transportation hub project in the bustling Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a major center for foreign trade in China.
To facilitate smooth ship navigation, the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge, with a main span of 1,666 meters, adopts the offshore steel box girder suspension bridge design, also the world's largest of its kind. It boasts the highest bridge deck of 91 meters and the highest air traffic clearance altitude of 76.5 meters worldwide.

However, the bridge also faces substantial obstacles in wind resistance as it is located in the open waters of the Pearl River Estuary, which is prone to strong typhoons.
To tackle these challenges, the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link administration center collaborated with multiple universities and research institutions, conducting research for over three years. Together, they have developed a new combined aerodynamic control technology that has greatly enhanced the wind resistance capabilities of the large-span steel box girder suspension bridge. The highest flutter critical wind speed for the bridge has been lifted to 88 meters per second.
The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link has achieved full 5G coverage, providing passengers with strong signals throughout their journey, whether on the open sea or in the extraordinarily long underwater tunnel.
The ceiling of the underwater tunnel features an artfully designed motif with blue skies and white clouds. This eye-catching display is created by an array of uniquely shaped, colorful lights arranged at different angles. Apart from being visually appealing, such a unique design also serves practical functions such as safety guidance and color-coded alerts.
On the west artificial island of the project, there is a 55-meter-tall ventilation tower, the tallest single structure on the island. It functions as the ""respiratory system"" for the entire tunnel, said Zhu Dingtao, an engineer with the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link administration center. Positioned near the tunnel entrance, the tower works with axial fans to expel exhaust gas from the tunnel; in case of a fire, it can quickly remove smoke from the immersed tube, added Zhu.
In addition to the ventilation tower, there is a central utility tunnel that runs between the two-way traffic lanes of the underwater tunnel. It serves as the ""nerve center"" of the entire structure, home to various equipment including power supply, water supply and drainage, fire protection, communications, and intelligent control facilities. It also acts as a crucial emergency escape route, allowing people to access the opposite traffic lane for evacuation in case of emergencies.

In the command center of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link, there is a digital twin platform developed in tandem with the project. This platform uses precise 3D simulation modeling technology to recreate a 1:1 scale replica of the physical environment of the bridges, artificial islands, and tunnel of link. It provides a real-time, 24-hour view of vehicle traffic and includes smart management functions such as intelligent vehicle tracking, driving behavior analysis, and monitoring of vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
During the construction of the link, an array of cutting-edge technologies have been employed to ensure safety and efficiency.
For instance, a network of fixed cameras has been installed throughout the tunnel to identify overheating vehicles before they enter the tunnel, track them in the tunnel and make immediate response if emergencies happen.
Weather sensors and meteorological radar systems have been installed to monitor meteorological conditions in real time. The information they obtained is then combined with weather forecasting data to predict potential weather-related hazards. This integrated approach allows for early detection of adverse weather conditions that could affect driving safety on the bridge sections and artificial islands.
Besides, there are 14 intelligent inspection robots capable of collecting data on the tunnel's environment and the conditions of its equipment and facilities.
All these advanced systems allow for rapid coordination with nearby fire and rescue services, traffic police, medical units, and emergency response units to ensure driving safety.

Sino-French satellite detects gamma-ray bursts after in-orbit test
 (Xinhua) 09:39, July 09, 2024
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An astronomical satellite jointly developed by China and France has recently detected gamma-ray bursts since its launch two weeks ago, marking a promising start to this high-level cooperation project between the two countries.
After in-orbit tests, the satellite platform is functioning normally and the satellite has established real-time connections with over 40 ground communication stations. All four payloads have successfully completed their power-on tests, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said on Monday.
The satellite, the Space-based Multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM), was launched on June 22. Mounted with four scientific payloads developed by Chinese and French scientists, it is currently the world's most capable satellite for multi-wavelength, integrated observations of gamma-ray bursts.
Among the four payloads, the gamma-ray monitor developed by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the CAS began in-orbit tests on June 27 and successfully captured the first gamma-ray burst, coded GRB 240627B, on the same day. This marks the first in-orbit detection result of the SVOM satellite.
The monitor also detected two additional gamma-ray bursts on June 29 and July 2, respectively. The results of the three gamma-ray bursts have been sent to the General Coordinates Network, an international collaboration platform for astronomy research. The CAS said that it has verified the monitor's high-precision detection capability for gamma-ray bursts.
The SVOM satellite will complete various tests by a satellite operation and control center under the CAS, with the scientific observation tests expected to start in August.
Gamma-ray bursts, usually very short in duration, are the most violent explosive phenomena in the universe after the Big Bang, and they occur during the collapse of massive stars or the merging of binary compact stars. In-depth observation and research of gamma-ray bursts will help mankind understand some of the fundamental questions of science, according to Wei Jianyan, SVOM's Chinese principal investigator.
The main scientific objectives of SVOM include searching for and rapidly locating various gamma-ray bursts, comprehensively measuring and studying their electromagnetic radiation properties, investigating dark energy and the evolution of the universe through these bursts, and observing electromagnetic signals associated with gravitational waves, Wei added.

BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China has mobilized several remote sensing satellites to aid rescue and relief efforts following a dike breach on Friday at Dongting Lake, the country's second-largest freshwater lake in central Hunan Province.
According to the China Centre For Resources Satellite Data and Application (CRESDA), Gaofen-3 02, Gaofen-3 03, Gaofen-1, and Gaofen-4 satellites have been deployed to provide real-time monitoring of the affected areas.
As of Saturday, satellite imaging has been conducted five times, CRESDA said, adding that data has been swiftly provided to the relevant departments.
On Friday afternoon, a Dongting Lake dike burst in Tuanzhou Township, Huarong County under Hunan's Yueyang City, triggering flooding in the area. Thousands of rescuers, including firefighters, hydrologists, volunteers and police, have been working tirelessly to safeguard lives and properties.
Satellite images revealed extensive flooding in areas previously identified as meadows or land. They documented a significant reduction in land area and expansion of water surfaces within Dongting Lake, exacerbated by inflows from upstream tributaries surpassing alarm levels.
""We will continue to closely observe the disaster situation in Huarong County and provide remote sensing satellite data and analysis services for flood rescue and relief, disaster assessment and other work,"" CRESDA said.
Additionally, many commercial satellites have joined the relief operations. Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd., a commercial aerospace enterprise based at Changchun, northeast China's Jilin Province, has deployed its Jilin-1 Kuanfu 01A satellite.
On Saturday morning, it captured high-resolution images of Dongting Lake shortly after the dike breach. The breach had widened to 226 meters by that time, with extensive local inundation compared to earlier images.
Meanwhile, Smart Satellite Technology Co., Ltd., utilized its SmartSat-X1 satellite to gather detailed data on the disaster area. Beijing Minospace Technology Co., Ltd. also activated its Taijing-4 01 and Taijing-4 03 satellites for the mission.
Taijing-4 03 completed imaging at 10:53 a.m. on Saturday, revealing a disaster zone spanning approximately 12.645 km in diameter and affecting an estimated area exceeding 42 square km. Taijing-4 01 identified potential hazardous risks in some southern areas of Dongting Lake.
The company said they have promptly shared this information with relevant authorities to enhance their situational awareness and response capabilities.
Dongting Lake has historically faced flood challenges. The affected area near Tuanbei Village now covers approximately 50 square km, echoing a similar dike breach incident in 1996.
Hunan Province has endured its heaviest rainfall of the year since June 16, surpassing historical records in some localities.

Report: Illegally grounded vessel of Philippines destroys ecosystem,2024-07-09,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0709/c90000-20191247.html,"Home>>
		
Report: Illegally grounded vessel of Philippines destroys ecosystem
By Yan Dongjie (China Daily) 08:20, July 09, 2024
A Chinese scientific expedition team discovered that the illegally grounded Philippine military vessel near China's Ren'ai Reef in the South China Sea has rusted, with peeling paint and the leaching of heavy metals severely affecting the quality of surrounding waters, according to a report.
The ""Report of the Illegally Grounded Military Vessel Destroying the Coral Reef Ecosystem at Ren'ai Reef"", released on Monday by the Ministry of Natural Resources' South China Sea Ecological Center and the South China Sea Development Research Institute, said that personnel on the vessel are suspected of fishing, and fishing nets and garbage have led to extensive coral death.
The Philippine military vessel has been illegally grounded since 1999 near Ren'ai Reef, an uninhabited reef that is an integral part of China's Nansha Islands in the South China Sea. This not only seriously violates China's sovereignty but also causes continuous damage to the coral reef ecosystem, according to the report.
Xiong Xiaofei, chief scientist of the scientific expedition, said: ""When I saw large areas of dead coral and fragmented coral reef pieces, I felt deeply saddened. Philippine fishing nets are entangled in the coral, and there is a large amount of garbage scattered around."" The Philippine military vessel was run aground in the northern part of Ren'ai Reef, he added.
In April, a team of scientists conducted a comprehensive ecological environment survey at the reef.
""As a Chinese witnessing the destruction of our precious marine environment by the Philippines, my immediate reaction is that we must stop them. Such illegal grounding, illegal fishing, and environmental pollution behavior are absolutely intolerable,"" said Xiong, who is also director of the South China Sea Ecological Center's National Field Scientific Observation Station for Nansha Coral Reefs.
Coral reefs, dubbed ""underwater oases"", are habitats for a large number of marine organisms and an essential component of marine ecosystems. Lyu Yihua, a researcher at the center, said that coral reefs grow slowly, and once damaged, recovery is difficult, affecting surrounding marine life.
""Many marine animals live on the coral reefs, with small fish taking the algae on its surface as food and attracting bigger fish, which add up to one of the most complicated ecosystems on Earth,"" Lyu said.
 
Based on satellite remote sensing and on-site investigations, compared with 2011, the overall coverage of reef-building coral at Ren'ai Reef has decreased by approximately 38.2 percent, with a reduction of about 87.3 percent in coverage within a radius of 400 meters around the illegally grounded Philippine military vessel.
""Global warming has led to a decrease in coral reef coverage worldwide. One main symptom of coral affected by rising temperatures is bleaching, which means they appear white. However, what we observe from the pictures and videos taken near Ren'ai Reef is coral entangled in fishing nets, with some even broken into fragments. These clear signs indicate the impact of human activities,"" Lyu said.
After excluding other environmental factors such as global warming, scientists attributed the degradation of the coral reefs to the fatal damage caused by the impact of the grounding of the Philippine vessel and its suppression of coral growth. Additionally, the leaching of heavy metals, the discharge of garbage and sewage by Philippine personnel, and abandoned fishing nets have caused long-term harm to coral growth, according to the report.
Xiong mentioned that in the waters near Ren'ai Reef, the expedition team also found multiple Philippine fishing boats anchored and operating, as well as three large-scale abandoned fishing nets from Philippine fishing boats.
On April 22, the team also discovered a 300-meter-long fishing net that covered and entangled coral in the eastern part of Ren'ai Reef, leading to the death and extensive fragmentation of coral.
""We observed at least four octopus fishing boats and several other ships. When we conducted environmental surveys, they would come nearby to disrupt,"" Xiong said. ""We speculate that these fishing nets and unidentified metal objects are intentionally set by Philippine militia to attract fish.""
In photos and videos captured by Xiong's team, metal equipment connected by ropes extending nearly 100 meters can be seen on the seabed around the illegally grounded Philippine military vessel, with these ropes having a destructive impact on the coral.
There are also fishing lines, rubber bands, glass bottles, iron discs, and other garbage in the surrounding waters, according to the report.
""Some beverage and food packaging has Philippine text on it, indicating their origin in the Philippines, which effectively shows that this pollution comes from Philippine people,"" Lyu said.
""To protect Ren'ai Reef, safeguard the coral, and preserve the South China Sea, the illegally grounded Philippine military vessel must be towed away immediately. Philippine fishing boats must cease operations and leave promptly, clean up the garbage, and provide a safe environment for marine life,"" he added.

Aerobic exercise alleviates aging skeletal muscle fibrosis: study,2024-07-08,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0708/c90000-20191223.html,"Home>>
		
Aerobic exercise alleviates aging skeletal muscle fibrosis: study
 (Xinhua) 16:44, July 08, 2024
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Walking in parks or along sidewalks in Chinese cities, it is common to encounter runners or joggers. In addition to promoting physical fitness, they could also be alleviating aging skeletal muscle fibrosis through aerobic exercise.
According to a recent research article published in the Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle, Chinese researchers have disclosed that aerobic exercise effectively reverses decline in endurance capacity and mitigates muscle atrophy in aged mice.
Aging negatively impacts tissue repair, particularly in skeletal muscle, where the regenerative capacity of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) diminishes with age. Although aerobic exercise is known to attenuate skeletal muscle atrophy, its specific impact on the regenerative and repair capacity of MuSCs remained unclear.
The researchers from the South China Normal University exposed mice to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) from either nine months to 25 months or 20 months to 25 months, and evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise on MuSCs function and muscle regeneration.
The results showed that the MICT initiated at both nine and 20 months led to a marked increase in running duration and distance, according to the study. Additionally, the MICT resulted in increased skeletal muscle weight and an enhanced cross-sectional area.
Notably, the secretion of connective tissue growth factor increases in the MuSCs aging process, which not only impairs the regenerative capacity of MuSCs, but also leads to skeletal muscle fibrosis.
Aerobic exercise has shown the capacity to lower this harmful effect, and thus it could be useful to promote it among the elderly.

China's self-driving cars on course for true road readiness,2024-07-08,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0708/c90000-20191108.html,"Home>>
		
China's self-driving cars on course for true road readiness
 (Xinhua) 14:48, July 08, 2024
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's autonomous driving sector is ramping up with a robust expansion of road testing sweeping the country.
This new phase sees the technology threading through the vibrant streets of populous metropolises, navigating the challenging topography of mountainous regions and making inroads into sectors such as agriculture and retail.
""For China, each road test is a step towards a future in which smart mobility redefines the urban and rural commute, with self-driving cars in the vanguard of a transportation revolution,"" said Du Xiaoping, technical director of cloud platform of National Innovation Center of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles.
By the end of 2023, the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan had opened 3,379 km of one-way testing roads across 3,000 square km, benefiting 7.7 million local residents.
With only one month ahead of the second anniversary of the pilot program for autonomous driving in this city, the technology has now progressed to truly driverless operation without safety supervisors aboard. The fleet has since expanded to over 500 vehicles, extending operations to include cross-district travel and night driving, making Wuhan the world's largest operational area for autonomous driving services, said local authorities.
Even in the mountainous city of southwest China's Chongqing, the presence of autonomous buses and taxis is no longer a novelty. One of its districts, Yongchuan, has recorded 1,446 km of two-way testing roads across its entire 1,576 square km designated for driverless vehicles.
Road testing has now reached China's vast northern and western inland cities. In Hohhot, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China's first cross-border freight corridor designed for automated guided vehicles (AGVs) went fully operational last month.
""Testing autonomous vehicles in such intricate and varied environments is instrumental in amassing a wealth of training data, which in turn propels the advancement of autonomous driving technology in various regions throughout China,"" said Chen Zhuo, general manager of Baidu's self-driving business.
In economically vibrant cities, intelligent connected passenger cars, buses, cleaning vehicles, patrol cars and retail vehicles are also becoming a common scene.
SMART AND SAFE
In cities like Wuhan, driverless vehicles are now operating amidst bustling traffic without the presence of safety supervisors. Many industry insiders and experts believe that these vehicles are safer than people could have imagined.
As of April this year, Baidu has logged over 100 million km in autonomous driving tests and operations without a single major accident resulting in severe injuries.
The incident rate of driverless vehicles, including ""Robotaxi,"" Baidu's online unmanned car-hailing services, is significantly lower than that of traditional vehicles, with most incidents being rear-end collisions caused by other vehicles behind, according to the Chinese tech giant.
There are stringent criteria for issuing licenses to autonomous vehicles, according to Chinese industry insiders.
Such criteria include rigorous testing of the vehicle's autonomous capabilities by third-party organizations and a comprehensive review by a joint working group comprising government departments of industry and information technology, transport and public security, Lin Xuexin, deputy director of the Hefei Intelligent and Connected Vehicles Innovation Center, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""All driverless vehicles on the road are linked to a central data-monitoring platform and in the event of any problems, relevant personnel will be dispatched to the site promptly,"" Lin added.
Despite the impressive performance of autonomous vehicles, many industry insiders believe there is still a long journey ahead before China's autonomous driving can achieve full commercialization.
China has adopted the ""vehicle-road collaborative intelligence"" approach from an early stage to develop its autonomous driving technology, said Li Xiaohui, a technologist at China Automotive Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd.
""To realize such a collaborative system, it is essential to develop an array of supporting infrastructure, such as intelligent roads, wireless communication networks and high-precision positioning services in the future,"" Li explained.
Other experts also pointed out that China's top-level legal and regulatory framework regarding autonomous driving must be refined, building upon the local legislation that has already been enacted in various regions across China.
Zu Hui, deputy director of intelligent vehicles and smart mobility innovation center under China Merchants Testing Vehicle Technology Research Institute Co., Ltd., stresses the importance of clarified legal requirements for the operation of autonomous driving systems, accident determination boundaries and product liability.
""The commercial operation of autonomous vehicles requires substantial data accumulation and scenario training,"" said Feng Xingya, general manager of Chinese automaker Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd. ""Appropriate measures should be taken to relax the restrictions on collecting the required scenarios and geographical data.""

Researchers develop 3D printable elastomers with exceptional strength, toughness
 (Xinhua) 09:21, July 08, 2024
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from Zhejiang University have developed 3D printable elastomers with exceptional strength and toughness, according to a study published in the journal Nature.
3D printing has emerged as an attractive manufacturing technique because of its exceptional freedom in accessing geometrically complex customizable products. However, its potential for mass manufacturing is hampered by its low print speed and insufficient mechanical properties.
Recent progress in ultra-fast 3D printing of photo-polymers has alleviated the issue of manufacturing efficiency. However, the mechanical performance of typical printed polymers still falls far behind what is achievable with conventional processing techniques.
""To make 3D printing technology adaptable to more scenarios, it is necessary to alter the material properties,"" said Fang Zizheng, a researcher from the university.
The researchers developed a 3D photo-printable resin chemistry that yields an elastomer with a tensile strength of 94.6 MPa and toughness of 310.4 MJ m-3, both of which far exceed those of any 3D-printed elastomer.
The researchers printed a rubber band using this new material and conducted endurance tests on it. The experiments showed that the rubber band could be stretched up to nine times its original length and withstand a tensile strength of 94 MPa without breaking.
Additionally, the researchers used the material to create objects like balloons with excellent puncture resistance.
The research marks a breakthrough in overcoming material limitations in 3D printing technology, bringing new hope for its large-scale application in the manufacturing of high-performance products, according to Wu Jingjun, a professor from the university.

In a groundbreaking discovery, researchers from the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have found a desert moss species, known as Syntrichia caninervis, that has the potential to survive in extreme conditions on Mars.
The Global Times learned from the institute that during the third Xinjiang scientific expedition, the research team focused on studying the desert moss and found that it not only challenges people's understanding of the tolerance of organisms in extreme environments, but also demonstrates the ability to survive and regenerate under simulated Martian conditions.
Supported by the Xinjiang scientific expedition project, researchers Li Xiaoshuang, Zhang Daoyuan and Zhang Yuanming from the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography and Kuang Tingyun, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, concentrated on studying the ""pioneer species"" Syntrichia caninervis in an extreme desert environment, according to the institute in an article sent to the Global Times on Sunday.
Through scientific experiments, the researchers systematically proved that the moss can tolerate over 98 percent cell dehydration, survive at temperatures as low as -196 C without dying, withstand over 5000Gy of gamma radiation without perishing, and quickly recover, turn green, and resume growth, showcasing extraordinary resilience.
These findings push the boundaries of human knowledge on the tolerance of organisms in extreme environments.
Furthermore, the research revealed that under simulated Martian conditions with multiple adversities, Syntrichia caninervis can still survive and regenerate when returned to suitable conditions. This marks the first report of higher plants surviving under simulated Martian conditions.
The research team also identified unique characteristics of Syntrichia caninervis. Its overlapping leaves reduce water evaporation, while the white tips of the leaves reflect intense sunlight. Additionally, the innovative ""top-down"" water absorption mode of the white tips efficiently collects and transports water from the atmosphere. Moreover, the moss can enter a selective metabolic dormancy state in adverse environments and rapidly provide the energy needed for recovery when its surrounding environment improves.
Based on the extreme environmental tolerance of Syntrichia caninervis, the research team plans to conduct experiments on spacecraft to monitor the survival response and adaptation capabilities of the species under microgravity and various ionizing radiation adversities. They aim to unravel the physiological and molecular basis of the moss and explore the key life tolerance regulatory mechanisms, laying the foundation for future applications of Syntrichia caninervis in outer space colonization.

BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Amid the global race to build artificial general intelligence, the development of stronger computing power has become a major focal point of China's strategic initiatives, driven by the needs of a booming digital economy and innovations in large language models.
Data revealed at the Global Digital Economy Conference 2024, which closed on Friday in Beijing, showed that by the end of last year, the total number of standard racks in use at data centers nationwide had exceeded 8.1 million in China, with a total computing power of 230 EFLOPS. EFLOPS is a measurement unit used to determine a computer's speed. A 1 EFLOPS computing system can complete 1 quintillion floating-point operations per second.
In the era of interconnected devices and data surges, computing power, as the ""new energy"" of the digital economy, is reshaping global economic landscapes at an unprecedented pace, said Wang Xiaoli, who is with the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, at the conference.
Looking ahead, China aims to boost the country's aggregate computing power by more than 30 percent by 2025, according to a plan released by six government departments in October 2023. The plan also sets a target for China's total computing power to reach 300 EFLOPS by 2025.
During this process, computing systems and data centers require substantial electricity to operate and cool hardware, making energy efficiency a critical consideration in the development of computing power.
In order to meet increasing energy demands, China's related sectors have undertaken extensive efforts to integrate the development of green energy with computing power. At the just-concluded conference, Yan Gang, technical director of Yovole Network, a Shanghai-based cloud computing data center service provider, outlined their strategy for efficient energy storage using advanced energy management technologies.
""Our intelligent computing center employs combined cooling, heating, and power systems using hydrogen energy, photovoltaic storage, indirect evaporative cooling and liquid cooling technologies. In April, we also partnered with Tesla to apply their Megapack energy storage technology at our intelligent computing center,"" Yan said.
Meanwhile, due to the strong demand for computing power, eastern regions of China have shared development opportunities in the digital era with the rest of the country.

Expansive and resource-rich western provincial-level regions in China leverage significant advantages in terms of green energy and favorable geographical conditions. These factors enable them to provide high-quality computing resources and have led them to seize the opportunity to establish massive data centers that support the country's intelligent industries.
In December 2023, the city of Ulanqab in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region signed a strategic cooperation memorandum with the Beijing Municipal Commission of Economy and Information Technology to promote the influx of green computing power into Beijing.
According to Chai Yue, vice mayor of Ulanqab, the city plans to provide Beijing with over 10,000 PFLOPS of green general-purpose computing power annually by 2025. One PFLOP, or petaFLOP, equals one quadrillion floating-point operations per second.
Additionally, the region's computing power resources have transformed it from a traditional hub of the livestock industry into an attraction for AI-related sectors. According to the Big Data Management Bureau of Hohhot, the regional capital, half of the 70 large models registered in Beijing are undergoing training in Inner Mongolia.
In addition to establishing infrastructure such as data centers, computing service providers across various industries are exploring ways to integrate computing power directly into enterprises, households and business districts.
This promising sector is exploring the ""computing power plus"" model, forging deep collaborations with sectors including finance, education, healthcare, and transportation.
In 2020, Beijing launched an autonomous driving demonstration area in Yizhuang, located in a southern suburb of the capital. The intelligent road system utilizes holographic smart devices to monitor traffic conditions, supported by multifunctional poles along the road that transmit computational data to vehicles and real-time cloud systems. This vehicle-road collaboration technology, powered by abundant computing resources, optimizes driving solutions for cars, thereby enhancing traffic safety and efficiency.
""Computing power is widely applied across various sectors, including government, industry, transportation, and healthcare, continually driving the emergence of new technologies, models, and business forms. This infusion of innovation is providing significant momentum for high-quality economic development,"" said Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology.
