China's tech innovations benefit electricity development in Global South,2024-07-15,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0715/c90000-20193832.html,"Home>>
		
China's tech innovations benefit electricity development in Global South
 (Xinhua) 15:02, July 15, 2024
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China is at the technological forefront of electricity development and has provided the world with experience and practices in electricity innovation, according to a report issued on the sidelines of a high-level conference recently held in Beijing.
At a sub-forum of the second high-level conference of the Forum on Global Action for Shared Development, the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization (GEIDCO) issued the Research on Global Electricity Development Index.
The sub-forum, which was held Friday, was themed on energy transition and sustainable development. It was organized by GEIDCO, a non-profit international organization headquartered in Beijing and dedicated to promoting sustainable energy development worldwide.
Guan Xiupeng, vice director of GEIDCO General Office, told Xinhua that China's vast territory, with diverse geographical features such as deserts, forests, plateaus and permafrost areas, has an impact on economic and social development.
""Based on such conditions, China has explored electricity technologies and development models that are suitable for its development and has accumulated a wealth of experience on project construction, which can also be shared with other countries, especially in the Global South,"" he added.
The research report mentioned that China is at the technological forefront in new energy power generation, Ultra High Voltage (UHV) power transmission, flexible direct current transmission, and the digitization and intelligentization of electricity systems.
Taking UHV for example. The development of UHV technology is driven by the long distance between China's clean energy resources, mostly in the western regions, and consumption centers in east China. It has not only solved the problem of long-distance, large-capacity power transmission but also realized the mass consumption of clean energy.
On the other side of the globe, UHV technology has found its place in Brazil, a country with abundant hydropower resource in tropical rainforest in its northern part, and densely populated areas in the south.
The State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), a leading state-owned utility company, has applied the technologies and experience earned at home to this South American country, including 800kV UHV direct current transmission technology, which sends electricity from the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant in Para state to big cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
The mega-project traverses a vast area, stretching more than 2,000 km over tropical rainforests and rivers, to supply the power consumption of some 22 million people, about 10 percent of the Brazilian population.
As of now, 180 billion kWh hydropower has been delivered via the project, equivalent to saving 64 million tonnes of standard coal or cutting 170 million tonnes of CO2 emission.
The project strictly complies to environmental regulations. When laying power transmission lines, the engineering teams bypassed the local indigenous settlements and ecological conservation areas in accordance with local laws and regulations. In 2019, it was recognized as the best social and environmental management practice in Brazil.
Besides the project construction, Chinese companies also promote technology transfer by training local talent for long-term operation and maintenance, with the smart electricity meter project in Saudi Arabia as one such example.
The agreement for the project was signed by SGCC and Saudi Electricity Company in 2019, and included the installation of 5 million electricity meters and the development of supporting facilities. Technology services, equipment integration, trial tests, and maintenance and personnel training were also part of the project, which was the largest deployment of smart electricity meters in the world at the time.
Deng Guoxue, one of the project experts from SGCC, was busy not only with installation work, but also with running local personnel training classes. He developed a set of English training materials, including textbooks, lecture notes and student manuals for his Saudi colleagues.
Ihab Mohammad, one of the local trainees, said he had witnessed the diligence, responsibility and professionalism of the SGCC employees, who have completed a high-quality project with their wisdom and hardwork to benefit the local people.
The Chinese contractors not only build power systems, but also bring domestic experience to the field of environmental protection, enhancing the overall environmental level of the projects.
Located in the coastal, sandy area of Binh Dinh Province in Vietnam, the Phu My 330-megawatt photovoltaic power station is a major new energy project in Vietnam's National Power Development Plan 7, and is the largest photovoltaic power station in central Vietnam.
The Power Construction Corporation of China, the project contractor, also considered the various application potentials during the project's design, such as expansion of energy storage, hydrogen and ammonia production, and desalination of seawater by green electricity.
As of the end of April 2023, the project had generated and sent a total of 695 million kWh of electricity to the grid, equivalent to cutting 670,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, or saving 220,000 tonnes of standard coal.
The project also transformed and utilized about 325 hectares of desertified and barren land, significantly reducing dust storms and improving local environment.

Artificial intelligence is being used to safeguard the country's oldest and tallest wooden pagoda in North China's Shanxi province which has withstood natural disasters and human calamities for 968 years.
The technology is being used to enhance the understanding of the 67-meter-tall Sakyamuni Pagoda, visualize its states over time, and prepare for restoration work.
AI is not only being used to aid in preserving the pagoda in Yingxian county's Fogong Temple, but also to enhance the visitor experience by revealing its significant architectural, historical, and religious value.
Built in 1056 during the Liao Dynasty (916-1125), the pagoda, built entirely out of wood without the use of nails, has weathered earthquakes, wars, and other challenges. Its intricate structure features innumerable mortises and tenons.
As tall as a 20-story building, and with a base diameter of about 30 meters, the pagoda is a remarkable architectural feat.
For its protection, visitors can only enter the first floor and are prohibited from climbing to higher levels. AI technology, however, will allow them to experience the whole pagoda through 3D animation.
When renowned architect Liang Sicheng visited the pagoda for the first time in 1933, he was impressed by the pagoda's intricate structure and ingenious design. He meticulously measured, surveyed, and recorded the building, introducing its treasured relics to China and the world.

In Yingxian, the Sakyamuni Pagoda, also known as the Yingxian Wooden Pagoda, has been the most prominent landmark for generations, but over the years the pagoda has developed a slight lean.
Zhao Yushan, a 63-year-old carpenter in Yingxian, was so taken aback when he first saw the tower as a teenager that he has since dedicated most of his life to replicating it. He's made numerous scale versions of the pagoda using only the traditional methods of construction and is currently working on an 8-meter-tall replica.
The pagoda is an octagonal structure comprising nine stories, with five visible from the outside and four concealed within. The Buddhist statues on each story and the paintings adorning the inner walls of the first floor are all creations from the Liao Dynasty.
""We local people believe the pagoda was built by Lu Ban (China's legendary master carpenter of the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC). The work is beyond manpower,"" said a Yingxian resident surnamed Li.
He said that as the pagoda's lean has increased over the past few years, the need for restoration has become more urgent.

High-tech preservation
In April, a virtual reality program that replicates the pagoda was released by Chinese technology company Lenovo Group and Tsinghua University's School of Architecture.
Wearing VR glasses, visitors can experience what it would be like to climb the pagoda and explore its interior.
The program has been donated to the county government to become a part of its digital museum.
In February last year, the school began conducting modeling work on the wooden structure inside the pagoda, creating a database of parameters through structural research.
Meanwhile, Lenovo Group is utilizing its AI-generated spatial computing technology, which combines AI, neural radiance fields technology, and extended reality technology to construct a digital ""twin"" of the pagoda.
Besides benefiting tourists, the technologies provide strong technical support for re-creating the complete structure and details of the pagoda.
Mao Shijie, vice-president of Lenovo Group and head of Lenovo Research Shanghai, said the project has utilized cutting-edge AIGC technology, enabling the swift digital reconstruction of the pagoda within 10 hours.
""It was a task that would have taken months using traditional methods,"" he said.
By combining AI algorithms with data collected from drones and radar cameras, the project aims to recreate the pagoda's intricate details accurately, he said.

Professor Liu Chang from Tsinghua University emphasized the importance of fully understanding the pagoda from various perspectives in guiding effective restoration.
He said unraveling the pagoda's historical transformations and predicting its future state are crucial steps in the preservation process.
Liu hopes to utilize the collected data to analyze and deduce the appearance of the pagoda during different periods.
""I can see how much the pagoda has been compressed and changed over time,"" he said.
By revealing the appearance of the pagoda at different stages of its history, Liu hopes to speculate on how the pagoda might have looked during certain periods, such as when well-known Chinese architect Liang Sicheng saw it in the 1930s, during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) and Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
""It may even be possible to predict the future appearance of the pagoda by adjusting parameters and simulating how the wood may change after over 100 years,"" he said.
The first step in protecting or even restoring the pagoda is to know it deeply, he said.
The pagoda is tilting, which means it is ""sick"", he said, and to ""cure"" it, they have to first find a ""hospital"".
Addressing the challenges faced in protecting the pagoda, Liu highlighted the need for meticulous preparation, a comprehensive understanding of the pagoda's condition, and the embrace of innovative technologies to drive conservation efforts forward.
Wang Xiaolong, deputy director of the Institute for the Protection and Research of Ancient Buildings and Colorful Sculptures in Shanxi province, hopes more information about the pagoda, such as the building's original design and material degradation, can be collected by utilizing technologies such as AI and big data.
""We experts are responsible for protecting and even restoring the pagoda, while other people can see this masterpiece and love it,"" Liu from Tsinghua University said.

China forges ahead at forefront of global battle against desertification,2024-07-14,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0714/c90000-20193260.html,"Home>>
		
China forges ahead at forefront of global battle against desertification
 (Xinhua) 09:32, July 14, 2024
China's remarkable strides in combating desertification have been highlighted on International Day of Combating Sand and Dust Storms, on Friday.
Over the past two decades, the country has witnessed a significant decline in the frequency and intensity of spring sandstorms, a testament to its robust ecological initiatives.
The National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Friday revealed a substantial reduction in the number of spring sandstorms, from an average of 17 times a year between 1981 and 2010 to 9.2 times in the last decade, nosediving about 46 percent.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, the country has intensified support for key ecological projects such as the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TSFP).
Such efforts have led to the successful management of 331 million mu (about 22 million hectares) of desertified land, with 53 percent of the treatable desertified areas now under effective control.
China, one of the nations most affected by desertification, has been grappling with the transformation of fertile lands into deserts, a phenomenon that disrupts rainfall patterns and exacerbates extreme weather events, further driving climate change.
The World Atlas of Desertification warns that 75 percent of the world's soils are already degraded, affecting 3.2 billion people globally. Projections by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are dire, with 90 percent of the planet's land surface at risk of degradation by 2050, posing significant threats to biodiversity and human life.
In stark contrast to this global outlook, China has achieved zero growth in land degradation and has successfully reduced the area of desertified and sandy lands.
A 2020 report from the Chinese Academy of Sciences indicated that China had achieved land degradation neutrality, with the net land restoration area accounting for over 18 percent of the world's total, placing it at the forefront of global efforts in this regard.
The TSFP, the world's largest afforestation project, serves as a good example. Launched in 1978 and scheduled to be completed in 2050, it has already helped safeguard the land inhabited by people in the northwest, north and northeast of China.
By 2020, the program saw the preservation of 480 million mu of forested land, the management of 1.28 billion mu of degraded grasslands, and the forest coverage rate increased from around 5 percent in 1978 to about 14 percent.
In June 2023, China proposed that the TSFP be turned into a fully functional, unbreakable ""green Great Wall"" and ecological security barrier in northern China.
As the International Day for the Prevention of Desertification and Land Degradation aims to galvanize a global sense of duty and urgency, China has emerged as a dynamic force in fulfilling its commitments to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.
On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly designated 2025-2034 as the ""United Nations Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms.""
Introducing the text of a draft resolution on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries and China, the representative of Uganda said sand and dust storms are an issue of international concern.
The storms increasingly threaten achievement of 11 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, he stressed, adding that the resolution aims to enhance international and regional cooperation to prevent, halt and mitigate their effects.

KUNMING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Milky Way galaxy can be larger than previously expected and have a more complex radial structure, according to scientists.
The study, conducted by researchers from Yunnan University and several international institutes, was recently published in Nature Astronomy.
Using data from stellar spectroscopic surveys, researchers constructed a radial density distribution of stars from the inner to the outer regions of the Galaxy, measuring the Galaxy's radius.
The result indicates that the Galactic disk structure in the outer disk region conforms to a classical exponential distribution while the inner disk region remains nearly flat. This finding is distinct from the long-standing assumption of a single exponential disk for the Galaxy, according to Lian Jianhui, a researcher at Yunnan University.
Lian said the study can impact measuring the Galaxy's key physical properties. Based on the assumption in the past, the half-light radius of the Galaxy, within which half of its luminosity is contained, was estimated to be about 10,000 light-years. The radius was extraordinarily smaller compared to galaxies of similar mass, and thus, the Galaxy was classified as a compact galaxy.
However, based on the complex density distribution proposed in the study, the Galaxy's half-light radius is 19,000 light-years, almost in line with the radius of nearby galaxies of similar mass. This indicates that the Galaxy is a typical disk galaxy in terms of size, said Lian.
Lian said the study contributes to understanding the Galaxy's overall structure and evolution.

Quantum simulation used to solve mysteries of high-temperature superconductivity
 (Xinhua) 16:33, July 11, 2024
HEFEI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has harnessed the capabilities of quantum simulation to delve into the mysteries of high-temperature superconductivity, securing breakthroughs in two frontier technologies at once.
The researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) constructed an ultra-cold atomic quantum simulator to address a typical model that depicts the behavior of materials in high-temperature superconductivity.
The complexity of solving this model, also known as fermionic Hubbard, is so profound that even the most formidable supercomputers cannot simulate it efficiently.
The team's work outperformed the computational capabilities of any classical computer, thus demonstrating the quantum supremacy in solving pivotal scientific questions.
The quantum simulator, which uses ultracold particles trapped in optical lattices, observed solid evidence of an anti-ferromagnetic phase transition for the first time in the model, according to the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
The anti-ferromagnetic phase transition is a phenomenon in which, when the system's temperature falls below a critical threshold, the spins of the electrons within the material change from a state of disarray to a structured, alternating pattern.
A quantum simulator that validates this phase transition is the first step towards developing a more advanced one capable of ultimately solving the model.
Superconductivity is a fascinating state in which certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance when cooled below a certain critical temperature, and the high-temperature superconductors are a class of materials that show superconductivity at significantly higher temperatures than conventional superconductors.
The discovery of high-temperature superconductors could lead to new possibilities for multiple practical applications, including energy storage, power transmission and new modes of transportation.
The result is ""an experimental tour de force"" that ""marks an important step forward for the field,"" and ""could become a notable milestone for modern science and technology and a major breakthrough,"" commented the paper's peer-reviewer.

Chinese researchers find new vampire squid species
 (Xinhua) 15:51, July 11, 2024
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have identified a new species of vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis), only the second known vampire squid species in the world.
Researchers from the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences collected a specimen similar to Vampyroteuthis infernalis (V. infernalis) in September 2016 at depths between 800 and 1,000 meters in the South China Sea.
The research team conducted a morphological and phylogenetic analysis between the specimen and V. infernalis. The results indicated that the morphology presents notable differences in tail shape, lower beak, photophores position. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial COI and nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences revealed well-supported long distances and clear separation of the specimen from V. infernalis.
Qiu Dajun, study lead author, introduced that V. infernalis was initially described by German marine biologist Carl Chun in 1903, and it typically lives between 600 and 900 meters in the temperate and tropical Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans, where oxygen concentrations are low.
The new species was named Vampyroteuthis pseudoinfernalis Qiu, Liu & Huang, sp. nov. The study was published online in the journal Zoological Systematics.

Apollo Go Robotaxi, Baidu's autonomous ride-hailing platform, has been gaining public attention as it is winning new business in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, while market analysts even predicted that it could pave the way for commercial services.
""Taking a robotaxi is indeed cheaper than a traditional one. The interior of the vehicle is clean and smart, allowing passengers to choose their preferred music. Additionally, with no driver in the car, I can avoid interactions and contact, making it easier to rest,"" a local rider in Wuhan told the Global Times on Wednesday.
In Wuhan, a 10-kilometer ride in a self-driving robotaxi costs between 4 and 16 yuan ($0.60-$2.30), whereas a regular ride-hailing service costs between 18 and 30 yuan. Consumers can book fully autonomous robotaxis at any time of day through various Baidu apps in the pilot areas.
Data from Baidu shared with the Global Times showed that there are 300 fully driverless taxis operating in Wuhan.
There are two kinds of robotaxis in Wuhan - One is fully driverless robotaxis without human supervision, and the other is taxis with human drivers as the safety operators behind the wheel.
In the first quarter of 2024, bookings for fully driverless taxis in Wuhan accounted for 55 percent of all ride-hailing services.
This figure exceeded 70 percent in April, with expectations of sustained rapid growth ahead and reaching 100 percent over the coming quarters. Looking ahead, we plan to deploy RT6, our sixth-generation robotaxi in Wuhan this year, which will significantly reduce hardware depreciation costs, Robin Li, Baidu's founder, said during the company's the first quarter 2024 earnings call in May.
With the scaling of driverless operations and continuous improvement of cost structure, we believe Apollo Go Robotaxi will achieve operational UE breakeven in Wuhan in the near future. We will closely monitor efficiency and persist in optimizing the operation of our overall intelligent driving business, he added.
The robust development of the robotaxis operated by Baidu is due to the accelerated development of the technology, and the support from policies and infrastructure, Wu Shuocheng, a veteran automobile industry analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
The rising demand also triggers debates online, with some claiming it would lead to job losses for taxi drivers.
Robotaxis has some drawbacks. ""The wait time is long, taking 8-10 minutes from order to arrival, and the driving speed is slow, not an ideal choice for passengers in a hurry,"" one rider commented.
""Some routes aren't the shortest; they only follow the system's internal paths, and it may take more time,"" the rider added.
""I don't think we will lose our jobs because many people feel unsafe sitting in autonomous cars, especially during rush hours in Beijing,"" a taxi driver working for Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing company, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
""In an emergency, passengers cannot communicate flexibly with an autonomous car. Most people won't risk their lives just to save a bit of money,"" he added.
Also, there are no clear and unified policies regarding accidents caused by autonomous driving up to now. ""Clearly defining each party's responsibility in the event of an accident is essential before the large-scale commercialization of robotaxis. For example, if an accident occurs due to a network signal interruption, which party should be held responsible?"" Wu said.
Apollo Go Robotaxi is on track to achieve profitability with its advanced autonomous ride-hailing model. Passenger testing operations have been launched in 11 cities and fully autonomous driving tests have been carried out in Beijing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai, according to Guotai Junan Securities' report.
Outside of Apollo Go, there are some different brands testing autonomous ride-hailing services nationwide. On June 23, AutoNavi and WeRide launched such services in Guangzhou's Huangpu district. On June 27, Didi Chuxing announced autonomous ride-hailing trials in parts of Shanghai.

Chinese scientists have discovered a new species similar to the vampire squid in the depths of the South China Sea. The creature belongs to a previously unknown cephalopod from the Vampyroteuthis family.
Researchers from the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other institutions recently published a paper in the English academic journal Zoological Systematics.
The vampire squid - Vampyroteuthis infernalis - is currently the only extant species in the family Vampyroteuthidae. However, specimens from the Gulf of Guinea, Africa, and California suggested the possibility of additional taxa. Here, a second species of Vampyroteuthis, were collected from the South China Sea, the paper said.
Qiu Dajun, a researcher at the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained that German marine biologist Carl Chun in 1903 first discovered the ghost squid in the deep sea. It usually lives at depths between 600 and 900 meters, where light can hardly reach and oxygen content in the water is very low.
In September 2016, Chinese scientists collected a specimen at a depth of 800 to 1000 meters in the southeastern sea area close to Hainan Island.
The new species is different from its sibling species Vampyroteuthis infernalis by with an acuate tail. It is characterized by the following combination of morphological characters: a pair of photophores located at the midpoints between the fins and tail, and a lower beak with a broad, elongated wing, the paper said.
Through genetic analysis, they found that it is a new species with a significant genetic distance from the ghost squid on the evolutionary tree, confirming that the collected specimen is a new species and the second known existing species of the Vampyroteuthis family.
