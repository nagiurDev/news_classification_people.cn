New tech may reduce reliance on soybean imports
By Li Lei (China Daily) 10:27, May 22, 2024
China has in recent years adopted a mix of methods to reduce its reliance on imported soybeans, a crucial raw material for making animal feed, such as through crop rotation and the deployment of higher-yield varieties.
However, a group of scientists in Tianjin have taken a different approach. They have set their attention on protein biosynthesis using methanol as a raw material, where progress has stalled for decades due to the hefty costs.
A breakthrough could potentially help wean China off its reliance on proteins derived from soybeans.
The researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, led by Wu Xin, recently announced a commercially viable approach to biosynthesize protein that can be used in making animal feed.
Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts on Nov 17.
""Research on synthesizing cellular protein from methanol began in the 1980s,"" Wu said in the paper.
""Yet, due to high costs, methanol-synthesized protein products could not compete with soy protein and have not been produced on a large scale,"" he added.
According to the paper, the approach involves industrial fermentation using methanol, which can be cheaply derived from coal, as raw material.
The yeast strain Pichia pastoris, used in this process, grows by using methanol.
Previous attempts to commercialize this method have stalled due to the toxicity and complex pathways of methanol, resulting in approximately 20 percent wastage.
To solve the problem, Wu's team collected over 20,000 yeast samples from vineyards, forests and marshlands across China. From those samples, they identified strains capable of efficiently using various sugars and alcohols as carbon sources.
And by knocking out specific genes in a wild Pichia pastoris strain, they engineered a yeast with significantly enhanced methanol tolerance and metabolic efficiency.
This engineering raised the conversion rate of methanol to protein to 92 percent, making this protein production method very attractive economically, the paper said.
""It doesn't require arable land, is unaffected by seasons and the climate, and is a thousand times more efficient than traditional agricultural practices,"" Wu said in the paper.
""Moreover, the protein content in the microorganisms ranges from 40 to 85 percent, significantly higher than in natural plants,"" he added.
These organisms also contain a complete amino acid profile, vitamins, inorganic salts, fats and carbohydrates, allowing them to partially replace fishmeal, soybeans, meat and skimmed milk powder in various applications.
China currently imports around 100 million metric tons of soybeans annually, mostly from Brazil and the United States.
Despite a national drive to ramp up domestic production in recent years due to vulnerable global supply chains, the country currently produces just around one-fifth of its needs.
In a major move to bolster domestic production, the Chinese government last year expanded the commercial use of genetic modification technologies to staple food crops including soybeans. Such technologies have long been restricted to cotton and papaya in the nation.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The South China Botanical Garden (SCBG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently completed a survey on plants in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), the first of its kind, as part of the country's special program to investigate the biodiversity of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
Four researchers from the SCBG's plant sciences center conducted the field survey on wild plants from May 6 to 10. The survey took place across four parks: the Seac Pai Van Park, the Ká Hó Reservoir Natural Park, the Hac Sá Reservoir Natural Park and the Taipa Grande Natural Park. During the survey, the researchers exchanged information on plant surveys, ecological monitoring, and vegetation restoration with local staff, the SCBG said in a press release on its official website.
The data collected in this survey has enriched the information on plants in Macao and also supplemented the data of the National Wild Plant Germplasm Resource Center, it said.
Macao plays a crucial role in biodiversity conservation within the Greater Bay Area. This survey has provided a deeper understanding of the current status of plant diversity in Macao and the significant achievements made by Macao SAR government in biodiversity conservation, it said.
As an economic engine of China, the biodiversity-rich Greater Bay Area also faces challenges in biodiversity conservation.
China launched the special program in March 2023 to investigate and analyze the current status of biodiversity conservation and assess the impact of urbanization on biodiversity in the Greater Bay Area so as to provide scientific support for the area's ecological civilization construction and sustainable development.
Led by the SCBG, the program was undertaken by 11 leading institutions on wildlife research and study in south China.

Researchers predict landslide displacement with satellite images, machine learning
 (Xinhua) 16:42, May 21, 2024
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of researchers has proposed a novel physics-based and cost-effective landslide displacement prediction framework, according to a research article recently published in journal Engineering Geology.
The prediction of landslide deformation is an important part of landslide early warning systems. Displacement prediction based on geotechnical in-situ monitoring performs well, while its high costs and spatial limitations hinder frequent use within large areas.
The researchers from China University of Geosciences, Peking University, Leibniz University Hannover and GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences used the combination of Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) and machine learning techniques to extract displacement time series for the landslide from satellite images to provide low-cost basic data for early warning and forecasting.
The application of the prediction method in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China showed that the MT-InSAR can accurately monitor landslide deformation and machine learning algorithms can accurately establish the nonlinear relationship between the landslide deformation and its triggers.
By integrating the advantages of MT-InSAR and machine learning techniques, the proposed prediction framework, considering the physics principles behind landslide deformation, can predict landslide displacement cost-effectively within large areas, noted the research article.

Study reveals potential air pollutants present in gyms
 (Xinhua) 16:14, May 21, 2024
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- People frequent gyms to maintain their fitness levels, but what about the quality of the air they breathe in these confined spaces? Chinese researchers have recently delved into this question through a case study.
Led by Sun Yele, a professor from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a research team examined the composition and concentration of pollutants within a basement gym. Their findings, published in the journal Environmental Science &Technology Letters, shed light on the air quality of indoor fitness environments.
""The gym's proximity to our office provided an ideal setting for our investigation. Over a span of 20 consecutive days, we meticulously analyzed the air using a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer,"" explained Sun.
Their study revealed that the indoor air within the gym exhibited a higher proportion of organic aerosols (OA) compared to the outdoor environment. ""Approximately 50 percent of the particulate matter inhaled within the gym comprised OA, a notable increase from the roughly 40 percent observed outdoors,"" Sun said.
Two distinct types of OA were identified within the gym atmosphere. The first, siloxane organic aerosols (SiOA), stood out due to unexpectedly high concentrations, comprising 7 to 11 percent of the total OA present. Sun attributed the presence of SiOA to the silicone polymer lubricant used in fitness equipment during exercise.
Additionally, the researchers detected cigarette smoke organic aerosols within the gym, which likely entered the indoor environment from adjacent spaces such as a nearby parking lot. Furthermore, OA stemming from cooking activities in the nearby canteen were also found to contribute to the indoor air quality within the gym.
""The ventilation system of the gym might inadvertently draw in pollutants from external sources,"" Sun said. ""While our study represents a single case, it underscores the susceptibility of gyms to surrounding emission sources.""
The researcher believes that understanding the composition and concentration of pollutants in the gym environment is crucial for evaluating the potential health risks associated with physical exercise. ""During exercise, heightened respiratory rates increase the inhalation of these particles, which could potentially impact our health,"" Sun said.
The study advocates comprehensive assessments of air quality across various gym facilities, considering factors such as equipment diversity, occupancy rates, and ventilation systems. Such investigations are instrumental in devising effective strategies to safeguard indoor air quality and mitigate health risks associated with gym attendance.
""We aim to expand our research by conducting case studies across multiple gyms to validate the universality of the pollution particles identified in this study,"" Sun said. He also expressed optimism about future improvements in instruments, envisioning real-time online monitoring of indoor OA molecular composition and volatile organic compounds for enhanced insights into air quality dynamics.

China builds radar network to support global space weather forecast
 (Xinhua) 14:21, May 20, 2024
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China has built a mid-latitude high-frequency radar network in the country's northern regions to provide high-quality detection data for global space weather forecast and warning.
The first batch of scientific detection results of the network was released at an international workshop of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), which opened in Beijing on Monday.
The network, constructed by the National Space Science Center (NSSC) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was completed in October 2023. It's also a part of the second phase of China's Meridian Project, a space weather monitoring network comprising ground-based stations.
China has made new breakthroughs in high-frequency coherent scattering radar technology and scientific research, and will deepen international cooperation in this field, said NSSC.
The ionosphere is home to all the charged particles in Earth's atmosphere. It's also home to many spacecraft including the space stations. Ionospheric irregularities can disrupt signals, scientists say.
Six high-frequency coherent scattering radars were set up in Jilin Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northern regions of China.
This high-frequency radar chain achieves large-scale continuous detection of ionospheric irregularities in mid and high latitudes of the Asian sector. The detection range can reach 4,000 km from south to north, and the east-west span exceeds 12,000 km, according to NSSC.
The high-frequency radar chain is expected to join the SuperDARN, a global network of scientific radars monitoring conditions in the near-Earth space environment, and realize real-time data exchange and sharing with databases in the United Kingdom and Canada.
The SuperDARN, which has members from a dozen of countries including the UK, the United States, Canada, Japan, China, France, Italy, Norway, Australia and South Africa, is also one of the main international organizations participating in the International Meridian Circle Program proposed by China.

Thailand, China jointly launch genomics research project
 (Xinhua) 13:54, May 20, 2024
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is poised to initiate a research project aiming to provide research tools and platforms for high-risk populations of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and offer risk prediction and intervention plans before symptoms appear, a senior Thai official said Saturday.
Supamas Isarabhakdi, Thai minister of higher education, science, research and innovation, announced the project at the 19th Annual Meeting of the International Conference on Genomics (ICG-19) held at the Faculty of Medicine of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.
The National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology of Thailand, under the higher education ministry, will cooperate with the Bangkok Genomics Innovation Public Company Limited (BKGI), a Thai-Chinese life science joint venture, to push forward the project based on new biomarkers such as Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).
""The TMAO test has the potential to revolutionize the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases in Thailand. By detecting the risk of cardiovascular diseases early, we can improve the quality of life of people and reduce healthcare costs associated with treating the disease in its severe stages,"" said Supamas.
Data shows cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke, are major causes of illness and death in Thailand. Some 100,000 cases of acute heart failure are recorded in Thailand each year. Stroke affects around 300,000 people annually, with a government expenditure of no less than 30,000 million baht (about 826 million U.S. dollars) per year.
Themed ""Omics, Wellness, and Longevity,"" the two-day event serves as a platform for scientists, researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders from around the world to exchange knowledge and collaborate on cutting-edge research in genomics and biotechnology.
Supamas said that for decades, BGI, a major shareholder of the BKGI, has been transferring technology to Thailand, elevating the country to a new level in life sciences and healthcare research. This advancement allows Thai people to diagnose diseases with a simple blood test and enables the formulation of treatment plans, especially when risks are identified ahead of time. These cutting-edge collaborative projects have already benefited over 100,000 Thai citizens.
Jeremy Cao, general manager of BGI Group South East Asia, said the company has initiated a series of collaborations with relevant Thai institutions in the healthcare sector in recent years. These collaborations include assisting Thai institutions in introducing prenatal testing technology and partnering on thalassemia prevention and treatment projects.
Thailand has a high prevalence of thalassemia, with the causative genes inherited through autosomal chromosomes among family members. Data indicates that around 30 to 40 percent of Thais are carriers of thalassemia genes. Cao said that timely detection of carriers and effective interventions are of great economic health significance for Thailand.
Additionally, BGI has worked with Thai universities to develop joint education programs on genomics and to train specialized talent in the field of life sciences, Cao added.

Letter from China: Exploring Space City in the Gobi Desert
By Yuan Quan (Xinhua) 11:03, May 20, 2024

JIUQUAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The weather in northwest China toward the end of spring is far from pleasant -- dry, windy and dusty. Despite frequent sandstorms, thousands of people are still drawn to visit because of the space launches.
Recently, I had the opportunity to spend a few days at ""Dongfeng Space City"" near the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, where I covered the launch of the Shenzhou-18 manned spacecraft. This experience provided me with an up-close glimpse into China's captivating enthusiasm for space-themed tourism.
For visitors, the quickest way to travel from Beijing to Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center is by flying to Jiayuguan Jiuquan Airport and then taking a four-hour drive to the city itself. The view through the car window reveals the vast expanse of the Gobi Desert, with the scorching sun casting its rays upon the ""lonely"" road. It is a landscape with little greenery and few buildings or other signs of human life.
This unchanging scenery persists until the emergence of ""Dongfeng Space City,"" which is a small oasis of humanity amid the desert. The term ""dongfeng"" means ""east wind"" in Chinese.
Inside the Space City, you'll find a whole new world: a park, a cinema, a clinic, a supermarket, hotels, restaurants, bakeries and clothing stores. There's even a farmers' market and a popular milk tea stand, giving visitors the impression that they're in an ordinary Chinese town. It is only when you come across roads named after ""Taikong"" (aerospace) and ""Yuzhou"" (cosmos) that you truly grasp the unique identity of this area. Local people have even designed the streetlights here to resemble rockets launching spacecraft.
Although many buildings, built in the 1960s and 1970s, look quite plain, the slogans on guide-boards here are poetic, such as ""The Gobi may be bitter, but Dongfeng is sweet;"" ""Make a wish to space, get together in Dongfeng;"" and ""Our triumph awaits in the stellar sea.""
The ""Wentian Pavilion"" is a must-visit spot. In Chinese, ""Wentian"" means ""asking heaven,"" and the pavilion serves as a working and living area for taikonauts in the Space City. Before every manned space launch, a departure ceremony takes place right outside the pavilion, offering a rare opportunity for the public to get up close to taikonauts.
The departure ceremony for the Shenzhou-18 crew lasted only about a few minutes, but people in the Space City gathered in the pavilion several hours in advance. The square in front of the pavilion soon transformed into a vibrant ""sea of red,"" with hundreds of people waving flags joyfully. Some were blowing horns and beating drums, and some were lifting children onto their shoulders. There were even those who livestreamed on their smartphones. Everyone eagerly anticipated catching a glimpse of the space heroes.
The Space City is where the Chinese aerospace dream begins. In 1970, China's first man-made satellite ""Dongfanghong-1"" was launched from the Dongfanghong satellite launch site. The launch site is now a 40-minute drive from the Space City. In 2018, after renovations, the Dongfanghong satellite launch site became a patriotic education base. Visitors can see two retired rocket launch towers. An exhibition hall nearby commemorates the journey of researchers who triumphed over the challenges of launching this ground-breaking satellite.
The current launch site is called the ""Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center,"" and it is renowned for being China's only manned space launch site. It takes half an hour by car to travel from the center of the Space City to the site. The public viewing area is a spacious playground. Keen space fans bring tents and telescopes, waiting for the moment when rockets thunder skyward. Nearby is an observation platform where the local tourism bureau organizes cultural performances before the launch.
Ten seconds before the rocket ignites, the crowd begins a countdown, and then with a thunderous roar, the rocket soars into the night sky. People at the scene can feel an immense wave of heat washing over them, and their eyes are captivated by the brilliant flames. At that moment, it feels as if the world falls silent, with all sound fading away, but a warm surge rushes through the heart.
Seven kilometers away from the launch site is the ""Dongfeng Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery."" Here lie hundreds of heroes who dedicated themselves to the cause of aerospace, including generals, soldiers, scientists and technicians from China, as well as herdsmen who gave up their homeland for the cause. The names of the deceased Dongfeng people are engraved on the ""Wall of Honor,"" with a QR code next to each name linking to their life stories.
There is also a souvenir shop in the Space City where you can buy refrigerator magnets and first-day covers, as well as various models of rockets, satellites and astronauts.
Visitors to the Space City are often recommended to taste the ""Aerospace Milk"" and ""Aerospace Yogurt."" At first, I didn't find the taste particularly special, but once I learned that they were produced from the exclusive pastures of the launch site, the drinks seemed to take on quite different flavors. Visitors can also taste grapes, watermelons, tomatoes, and other fruits and vegetables from the greenhouse at the launch site.
Nearby counties have also benefited from the tourism boom. The tourism bureau in Jinta County, Gansu Province, said that all 5,000 hotel beds in the county were fully booked a week before the launch of the Shenzhou-18. The local government plans a luxurious five-star hotel to meet the growing demand.
The aerospace cause is both lofty and down to earth. It matters not only for space exploration but also for economic and social development, and the booming space-themed tourism is the best illustration of this.
Space-themed tourism has come under the spotlight ahead of National Tourism Day, marked annually on May 19. I believe more industries, such as culture and education, will integrate with this burgeoning sector, providing further upward momentum for tourism.

NANNING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The past few years have witnessed increasing health risks triggered by climate and environmental change, experts said on Saturday during an international symposium in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
Around 300 experts and government officials from home and abroad joined the first Symposium on Environment and General Health &Livable Health and Longevity, sharing views and opinions under the theme of ""Jointly Improve Environment and Health for Green and Low-carbon Development"".
Participants were of the view that the relationship between climate change, ecological environment, and disease prevention and control has become increasingly close, with increasing risks of cardiovascular diseases due to more frequent heatwaves, rising incidence of hypertension and heart diseases due to dust storms, and notably higher rates of respiratory system diseases due to air pollution.
""There is growing recognition of the connection between the health of people and health of our planet,"" said Makiko Yashiro, programme officer for Ecosystem Management Sub-programme at UN Environment's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, via a video. ""Declines in nature have contributed significantly to the crossover of diseases from wildlife to people, or from wildlife to domesticated livestock. There is urgent need to scale up efforts to stop destroying nature, in order to prevent future pandemics like COVID-19.""
Cai Wenjia, a professor from the Department of Earth System Science at Tsinghua University, said that climate change is directly or indirectly affecting public health through various pathways, and the threat continues to grow. ""All sectors and industries need to work together on climate and health issues,"" she said.
Participants hailed the efforts that China has made on environmental protection and pollution control. ""Based on the slogan of 'beautiful nature,' China has moved from somewhere of a backseat for international green development to becoming the world leader,"" said Erik Solheim, former under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive director of the UN Environment Programme via a video.
Xiao Xuezhi, chief scientist with the Foreign Environmental Cooperation Center under China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said China has been promoting green alternatives by implementing a series of policies, laws and standards to reduce the emissions of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and has comprehensively phased out the use of 29 types of POPs.
He added that China will continue to fulfill the Stockholm Convention on POPs, strengthen the governance of new pollutants, accelerate the legislation on the management of toxic and hazardous chemicals, gradually establish a sound system for the governance of new pollutants, and further focus on tracking other potential toxic and harmful substances to prevent risks.

Long-term vision, national old-for-new initiative, will further boost China’s low-carbon technology success
By Wen Sheng (Global Times) 08:36, May 20, 2024

China's ongoing campaign to encourage enterprises and households to increase trade-ins of old manufacturing equipment and rundown consumer goods with new, modern and tech-studded ones is gaining pace. This is an effective step to boost domestic consumption and reduce the country's carbon footprint, which is good for China's all-around sustainable development in the long run.
The highly accommodative economic policy put in place by China's central government earlier this year will help modernize the country's massive inventory of industrial and household equipment. At the same time, it will stimulate the positive sentiment of the country's vast consumers, persistently boosting GDP expansion.
The sheer size of China's existing industrial and household inventory, targeted by the nationwide old-for-new campaign, will demonstrate the significance of the government-coordinated initiative. This will create a new horizon for China's development in the coming years.
Tens of millions of Chinese consumers are increasing their spending on consumer goods under the new round of trade-in program, unleashing huge consumption potential, bolstering sustained recovery and injecting new momentum into the country's economic growth. China will also provide financial support to establish recycling systems for discarded home appliances. Local governments and appliance companies are encouraged to offer preferential policies for consumers who buy or trade for green and intelligent home appliances.
Through the massive trade-in program, new machine tools and manufacturing equipment installed at Chinese factories and assembly lines will strengthen the country's manufacturing power. Targeted efforts to incentivize big-ticket item consumption like electric cars, home appliances, and furniture with discounts and coupons will boost retail sales, leading to increased factory production. Trade-ins in the field of home décor, kitchen appliances and bathroom products will drive the development of new and modern building materials.
According to the government-released plan, by the end of 2025, the country will increase the recycling volume of old home appliances by 15 percent and the recycling volume of old-fashioned, environmentally polluting ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles by 50 percent from 2023 levels. The program will continue over several years to provide lasting momentum for the country's economic growth.
Looking back at the past 45 years, the Chinese government has consistently accurately predicted the trajectory of global industrial evolution and people's consumption patterns. The government has become increasingly forward-looking and visionary.
Many years ago, policymakers began focusing on nurturing China's homegrown innovation capability in low-carbon industrial production, investing significant resources in scientific exploration and technological development. This effort has led to the country's current advantages in manufacturing high-end batteries, electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, as well as modern transport systems like high-speed trains and urban metro networks.
In the years ahead, a country's low-carbon manufacturing technology and industrial capacity will decide its role in leading and driving the global economy. Countries, regardless of size, will inevitably embrace clean new energies and low-carbon lifestyles as the only sustainable way for the Earth.
China's growing low-carbon manufacturing power also illustrates that low-carbon industrial capacity is, and will continue to be, advanced capacity welcomed by the world, rather than the ""overcapacity"" claimed by US officials. The Biden administration has not considered the long-term implications of imposing excessively high tariffs on Chinese EVs, batteries, solar panels and other high-tech products. This reckless and even thoughtless decision will inflict long-term harm on the US' green transformation.
It is wise for China to promote a new wave of massive trade-ins of old manufacturing equipment and rundown consumer products, with modern, low-carbon, intelligent technology with internet connectivity or AI guidance, which are offered at a low price. Affordability, exemplified in the inexpensive batteries and EVs now being assembled in China, will be a significant variant for global consumers when they make purchases, whether by opening their wallets or using their mobile phones to pay.
Data from China's Ministry of Commerce showed that, as of the end of 2023, the number of household appliances in major categories such as refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners had exceeded 3 billion units, indicating huge potential for renewal and replacement.
During the country's old-for-new promotional campaign, consumers can enjoy subsidies equivalent to 10 percent of the product price, as well as discounts and shopping coupons given by retailers. Green and energy-saving household appliances containing innovative technology are highly encouraged as they are both of good quality and cost-effective.
Sales of green and energy-saving electric appliances skyrocketed by 110 percent during the five-day May Day break from May 1 to 5, compared with the same period last year. The new initiative has significantly unleashed new consumer vitality in China. To accelerate the transition to EVs replacing ICE cars, a number of Chinese automakers including BYD, Nio and Xpeng have offered preferential terms for consumers who scrap old and polluting cars in exchange for zero-emission EVs.
In summary, China's national old-for-new initiative is conducive to gradually phasing out fossil-fuel guzzlers and other outdated equipment and products with clean EVs and technology-intensive replacements. This initiative will bolster the country's industrial upgrade, stimulate the purchasing desire of Chinese consumers and improve people's quality of life. Ultimately, the initiative will support the rising competitiveness of the Chinese economy.

Zebrafish on China's space station in good condition: experts
 (Xinhua) 08:05, May 20, 2024
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The four zebrafish kept on China's Tiangong space station, which is orbiting about 400 km above Earth, are currently in good condition, experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said Sunday.
The experts revealed details of the latest developments concerning the country's first in-orbit aquatic ecological research project at a public science day event in Beijing.
On April 25, along with the three astronauts aboard the Shenzhou-18 manned spacecraft, four zebrafish and four grams of goldfish algae went into space, and these have been used to establish a self-cycling aquatic ecosystem in orbit, making a breakthrough in the field of raising of vertebrates in space.
According to Zheng Weibo, a researcher at Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics of the CAS, the astronauts have managed to collect water samples twice and have replaced the fish food box once. They found that the zebrafish were showing directional behavior anomalies, such as inverted swimming and rotary movement, in the microgravity environment on Tiangong.
Using the likes of water and fish egg samples, among others, scientists will carry out research on the impact of the space environment on the growth, development and behavior of vertebrates, as well as the material cycle of confined ecosystems in space, Zheng said.
Zebrafish, as a model animal with genetic similarity to humans, can be used for research on many human diseases, said Wang Gaohong, a researcher at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the CAS.
""Meanwhile, like astronauts, zebrafish need to pass through rounds of selection to become 'aquastronauts,'"" Wang added.

SHENZHEN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China's first intelligent offshore drilling platform was installed on Friday, according to the project team of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation in south China's Guangdong Province.
The platform, named ""Huizhou 26-6"" and weighing over 30,000 tonnes, has a projected deck area the size of eight standard basketball courts.
Wei Weirong, vice general manager of the project team, said the weight of the platform's upper block exceeds the limit of the lifting capacity of the floating crane, so the natural force of tides and the latest ship-load adjustment technologies were used during the installation.
The docking accuracy of the block insertion tip and the jacket was at the millimeter level, said Li Tao, general manager of the oilfield development project.
The amount of intelligent equipment is three times that of a traditional platform, but the space is reduced by one third. It has a series of powerful functions, such as intelligent production, intelligent drilling, equipment health management, intelligent security, etc., which can improve production efficiency by 20 percent and reduce operation and maintenance costs by 10 percent per year, according to the project team.

Chinese scientists create multi-node entanglement in metropolitan quantum network,2024-05-17,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0517/c90000-20171273.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists create multi-node entanglement in metropolitan quantum network
 (Xinhua) 16:45, May 17, 2024
HEFEI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists have created the world's first memory-memory entanglement in a multi-node quantum network over a metropolitan area.
The advancement has significantly extended the range of practical quantum entanglement networks, increasing it from a mere tens of meters to a substantial distance of tens of kilometers -- an enhancement spanning three orders of magnitude.
It has provided robust foundation for innovative quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum-enhanced long baseline interferometry.
Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to each other, even though the individual objects may be spatially separated.
In the quest to build the future quantum internet, a pivotal milestone entails the transition from two-node proof-of-principle experiments conducted in labs to comprehensive multi-node set-ups on large scales.
The researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China used three independent memory nodes, each equipped with an atomic ensemble quantum memory, together with a photonic server where detection of a single photon heralds the success of entanglement generation.
The memory nodes are maximally separated apart by 12.5 kilometers, according to the study published this week in the journal Nature.
The study has unveiled a remarkable demonstration where the generation of quantum entanglement is achieved simultaneously between any two memory nodes.
Also, the lifetime of the entangled states exceeds the duration required for a round-trip communication between these nodes, according to the study.
The achievement starts ""a new stage of quantum internet research,"" which paves the way ""for future large-scale quantum networks,"" commented a Nature's peer reviewer.
