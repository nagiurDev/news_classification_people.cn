A joint research team consisting of several Chinese institutions on Tuesday published the very first research paper on the nature of lunar samples returned by the Chang'e-6 mission in the journal National Science Review.
The paper not only filled a historical gap in the study of the Moon's far side, but also provided direct evidence for researching its early evolution.
The paper, led by China's leading research institutions, including the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Space Administration Lunar Exploration and Aerospace Engineering Center, discussed the physical, mineralogical, and geochemical characteristics of the returned samples.
Historically, a total of over 380 kilograms of lunar samples have been retrieved through six US Apollo missions, three Luna missions by the former Soviet Union, and one Chang'e-5 mission by China, all of which were collected from the Moon's near side.
The Chang'e-6 mission, however, marks the first time humanity has ever successfully collected samples from the Moon's far side, returning 1,935.3 grams of precious material.
The landing site for this sampling mission was located in the South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side, specifically at the edge of the Apollo impact crater, an area where the lunar crust is extremely thin, potentially revealing primordial materials from the early impact basins. Particle analysis shows a bimodal distribution of grain sizes, indicating that the samples may have undergone mixing from different sources.
The study indicates that the Chang'e-6 samples contain not only basalt that records the history of volcanic activity on the Moon, but also non-basaltic materials from other regions.
These samples serve as important ""messengers"" from the Moon's ancient past, providing crucial firsthand data for studying the early impact history of the Moon, volcanic activity on the far side, and the composition of the Moon's interior. The study also offers new insights into the geological differences between the Moon's far side and its near side.

Breakthroughs will help bolster tech self-reliance
By Fan Feifei (China Daily) 10:44, September 18, 2024
China's latest technological breakthroughs in homegrown deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines mark a significant milestone in the country's semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector, and will help reduce its reliance on chipmaking technology from foreign counterparts, enhancing the competitiveness of the domestic semiconductor industry, experts said.
Their comments came after the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that one of the DUV lithography machines, which operates at a wavelength of 193 nanometers with a resolution below 65 nm and an overlay accuracy below 8 nm, has been included in its guidance catalog for major technical equipment. However, the catalog did not specify which Chinese companies manufacture the DUV lithography machines.
China's first set of major technical equipment refers to equipment products that achieve important technological advancements and own intellectual property rights, but have yet to perform on the market, according to the ministry. These include complete equipment, core systems, and key components.
The ministry urged local governments to strengthen policy coordination in areas like industries, finance, and technology, in order to promote the innovative development and application of such equipment.
DUV lithography machines are used to manufacture certain types of semiconductor devices like memory chips, which go into everything from laptops to smartphones. While newer technologies like extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines are used to produce the most advanced chips.
Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecommunications industry association in China, said the latest achievements in the country's key chipmaking equipment indicate that Chinese chip manufacturers could use relatively advanced domestically made semiconductor machinery, which is conducive to improving the manufacturing level and ensuring the supply of homegrown chips.
He noted that the promotion and application of homemade DUV lithography machines are of vital importance in mitigating the negative effects of Western countries' sanctions on critical technologies, and enhancing the independent innovation capability of China's semiconductor industry.
""As homegrown lithography systems continue to mature and the applications expand gradually, it is expected that more cutting-edge chip manufacturing technologies and equipment will emerge, further raising the country's self-sufficiency rate in chipmaking and moving the semiconductor manufacturing sector toward higher-end production,"" Xiang said.
The major technological breakthroughs in domestic lithography machines came after the Dutch government announced earlier in September that it would further expand export restrictions on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, bringing the licensing requirements of chipmaking equipment company ASML's machines under its purview.
Li Xianjun, an associate researcher at the Institute of Industrial Economics, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the tightened export controls will seriously threaten the stability of global semiconductor industrial and supply chains and impede international technological cooperation, given China's growing presence in semiconductor manufacturing.
He emphasized that the recent remarkable progress in producing lithography equipment will bring about new business opportunities for Chinese semiconductor companies, and further motivate them to pool more resources into technological innovation amid increasingly intensified competition in the global semiconductor sector.
As the world's largest chip market, China's semiconductor industry has made achievements in recent years, said Roger Sheng, vice-president of research at market research company Gartner.
Data from the China Semiconductor Industry Association showed that the sales revenue of China's integrated circuit industry reached 559.7 billion yuan ($78.9 billion) in the first half of this year, up 16.9 percent year-on-year.
However, there is still a technical gap between Chinese chipmakers and their foreign peers, especially in cutting-edge semiconductor-making equipment and fundamental chip materials, Sheng said, adding that ""some advanced chip packaging and testing devices are dependent on imports"".
He said more efforts are needed to step up policy support and encourage domestic companies in the upstream and downstream of the chip industrial chain to strengthen cooperation and increase investment in research and development, in order to master critical technologies in the sprawling semiconductor sector.

On June 4 this year, a national flag carried by the lander of China's Chang'e-6 probe unfurled on the moon's far side, becoming the first national flag of any nation to be shown on the lunar far side.
The flag weighs only 11.3 grams, lighter than two 1-yuan coins. The threads used in it were made from a new high-performance material called basalt fiber. The fiber was produced by crushing natural basalt rocks, melting them and then drawing them into fibers. These fibers are only 1/3 the diameter of a human hair.
""Basalt fiber is lightweight, strong, corrosion-resistant, and environmentally friendly with a low carbon footprint. It can withstand temperatures ranging from -269 to 700 degrees Celsius, which further highlights its unique value,"" said Liu Jiaqi, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and former director of the CAS Institute of Geology and Geophysics.
According to Liu, basalt rocks, in their natural form, are in a columnar shape, roughly as tall as a person. ""They are abundant in China,"" he said.
Basalt deposits vary significantly, making it challenging to homogenize the raw material for fiber production. For over a decade, Zhu Zhaochun, head of a basalt mining company in Yuxian county, north China's Hebei province, has been working to tackle this technical challenge and improve the homogenization of the raw material.
The basalt used for the flag carried by the Chang'e-6 probe was sourced from Zhu's company. The company processes about 100,000 tons of basalt annually, but only 1/10 of this can be used to produce basalt fiber. The average price of this high-quality basalt is 600 yuan ($84.25) per ton, three times the price of basalt used for road construction.
How are rocks turned into fiber?

Traveling about 1,000 kilometers south from Yuxian county, People's Daily reporters arrived in Xiangyang, Hubei province, where Huierjie New Material Technology Co., Ltd. (Huierjie), the company that produced the basalt fiber on the national flag carried by the Chang'e-6 is located.
In the furnace, basalt rocks are melted into lava at high temperatures ranging from 1,450 to 1,500 degrees Celsius. The lava is then drawn through a platinum-rhodium alloy bushing, where high-speed drawing machines pull it into hundreds of fine, gold-brown threads, which are wound into strands.
Temperature control is a key technical challenge in the basalt fiber drawing process. After years of technological development, Huierjie can now produce basalt fiber with a diameter of just 5 microns, and each fiber can be drawn to a length of tens of thousands of meters.
An executive of the company told People's Daily that standard basalt fiber sells for 15,000 yuan per ton, while the new 5-micron basalt fiber product commands a price of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per ton.
Basalt fiber has excellent insulation and radiation-resistant properties, but as an inorganic fiber, it has a smooth surface and is brittle, making it difficult to weave. To address this, Wuhan Yudahua Textile and Garment Group Co., Ltd. (Yudahua) collaborated with Wuhan Textile University to study how basalt fiber could be blended with viscose fiber and other materials, overcoming several key challenges in producing basalt fine yarn.
After delivering a prototype of the national flag on the Chang'e-6 probe in October 2023, the research team began seeking ways to bring their technological achievements to the market, aiming to further advance the high-performance fiber industry.
Yudahua developed a flame-retardant, high-temperature-resistant basalt fiber fabric. The material feels like pure cotton denim, but when exposed to an open flame, it won't be burned.

""Basalt fiber is attracting attention not only in the textile industry but also in the automotive, aerospace, and medical fields,"" said Cao Genyang, a professor at Wuhan Textile University and a member of the development team of the national flag carried by the Chang'e-6 probe.
The potential applications of basalt fiber are expanding. On the sea, marine net cages made of the material used in eco-friendly oyster farms can withstand typhoons up to force 12; in the vast desert, basalt fiber is made into wind turbine blades and photovoltaic brackets to make them more endurable. Besides, basalt fiber is also made into composite rebar and protective layers for cables.
In April this year, China's leading automaker FAW Group released a new vehicle model featuring interior components made from basalt fiber composites. These materials reduce the weight of the components by over 20 percent while maintaining their original performance and offering the added benefit of low odor.
Industry experts estimated that by 2030, the automotive sector's demand for basalt fiber could reach 320,000 tons, with an output value of 8.4 billion yuan, potentially supporting a downstream parts market worth over 47 billion yuan.
Today, China has become the largest producer of basalt fiber in the world. In 2023, China's basalt fiber production reached approximately 30,000 tons, accounting for about 75 percent of the global output, with 9,000 tons exported. As of September 2023, over 13,000 applications for basalt fiber patents were filed globally, more than 8,600, or 66 percent, were from China.
Innovation knows no bounds. At an extraterrestrial fiber laboratory of Donghua University in Shanghai, fibers are being drawn under simulated lunar conditions - without oxygen, in microgravity, and at low pressure - using lunar soil samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission.
""Lunar soil and basalt have similar chemical compositions. By adapting basalt fiber production techniques, fibers drawn from lunar soil could become construction materials for future lunar bases, meeting the needs for in-situ resource utilization,"" said Zhu Meifang, an academician of the CAS and dean of the College of Materials Science and Engineering at Donghua University.

New goblet-shaped plant species found in south China
 (Xinhua) 09:05, September 18, 2024
GUANGZHOU, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently named a new plant species ""Thismia jinzun,"" which resembles a golden goblet mentioned in a masterpiece of renowned poet Li Bai (701-762).
The rare plant was discovered in Jianfengling national nature reserve, south China's Hainan Province, and belongs to the Thismia genus.
This genus has extremely stringent environmental requirements and is predominantly found in tropical regions, with a minority distributed in subtropical and warm temperate zones, according to Xu Han, a researcher from the Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry.
The island province of Hainan has a unique ecological environment that provides an excellent habitat for the new species and serves as a biodiversity hotspot for Thismia genus plants in China. There are 107 known species of Thismia genus plants worldwide, and so far nine of them have been spotted in China.
The discovery of the species confirms that efforts to conserve Hainan's tropical montane rainforests over the years have enriched the diversity of local plant species and expanded the genetic resources of wild plants, said Yang Haijun, a researcher from South China Agricultural University and the author of the research paper published in the international academic journal Phytotaxa.

BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese team of scientists on Tuesday published the first research paper on the lunar samples brought back by the Chang'e-6 mission, saying that the Chang'e-6 samples exhibit ""distinct characteristics"" compared to previously obtained lunar samples.
The study was carried out jointly by members from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center, and the Beijing Institute of Spacecraft System Engineering. The research paper was published in the National Science Review journal on the day of the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival.
The team found that the Chang'e-6 soil samples have a lower density than previous samples, indicating a more porous and loosely structured composition. The plagioclase content of the Chang'e-6 samples is significantly higher than that of the Chang'e-5 samples, while their olivine content is significantly lower.
The study has also revealed that the Chang'e-6 lithic fragment samples are primarily composed of basalt, breccia, agglutinate, glasses and leucocrate.
Geochemical analysis of the Chang'e-6 lunar samples has shown that their concentration of trace elements such as thorium, uranium and potassium is markedly different from the samples retrieved by the Apollo missions and the Chang'e-5 mission.
The Chang'e-6 probe was launched from China on May 3, 2024. On June 25, its returner made a landing in north China, bringing back 1,935.3 grams of samples from the far side of the moon.

Interview: Spanish AI director welcomes Spain-China scientific cooperation agreement
 (Xinhua) 09:18, September 17, 2024
BARCELONA, Spain, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- Coinciding with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's visit to China last week, the two countries signed an agreement to boost scientific cooperation, a move welcomed by Spain's scientific community, including a top AI researcher, who told Xinhua on Monday that collaboration is essential for research.
""Today, science and technology is developed in large teams and this can be seen by the fact that big technology companies have huge teams of engineers and researchers to meet the challenges they face. It's clear that either research is collaborative or there is none,"" said Carles Sierra, head of the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC).
The AI institute director stressed that scientific collaboration ""has to be common"" and ""free-flowing"" and that ""it's no longer possible to think that a single person can revolutionize the world with their ideas.""
Spain's Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Science and Technology of China to carry out joint research, as well as enabling the participation of scientific and technical staff from both countries in high-impact national research projects.
""Not long ago we were visited by a delegation from the Chinese Academy of Sciences about issues of artificial intelligence applied to education, and we shared ideas and looked into the possibility of collaborating in the future, it was all very free-flowing, as it also is between researchers in congresses,"" Sierra added.
The AI research director also pointed out the importance of welcoming students from other countries and that increasingly more scientists and researchers have the option of going abroad to find work.
""There are a lot of students from China who go abroad to train and many who come back again, and lately there are many more Western researchers who are going to pursue a career in China and who are being hired by Chinese universities, so I think the flow back and forth is working well,"" he said.
In fact, Sierra pointed to his own field of Artificial Intelligence as ideal for collaboration because the benefits of ""artificial intelligence as an extension of our capabilities"" and ""as a kind of friend who assists us in doing what we've always done but doing it a little better"" are universal.
Referring to the concerns about the adoption of AI, Sierra pointed out that ""AI automates cognitive processes and that's new for many people"" and that this lack of familiarity ""causes concerns about machines taking over our cognitive processes and thereby substituting us.""
The institute director also suggested that where Spain is concerned AI could be of particular help with the country's ""environmental challenges, such as the recent drought or dealing with the impact of climate change, while energy is also a challenge.""
Meanwhile, on Tuesday last week, the Spanish government announced that it would allocate nearly 15 million euros (16.69 million U.S. dollars) to grants for ""International Collaboration Projects"", which will go towards financing Spanish participation in some 77 international research projects and activities.

BEIJING, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agricultural scientists have developed a new variety of foxtail millet, setting a summer yield record, with the breakthrough expected to provide strong support for boosting grain production and revitalizing the country's millet industry.
The new foxtail millet variety, Zhonggu 25, was developed by researchers from the Institute of Crop Science (ICS) under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and cultivated in a demonstration field in central China's Henan Province. A recent expert measurement recorded a yield of 625.92 kilograms per mu (about 9,389 kilograms per hectare), breaking China's 2014 summer foxtail millet yield record per mu.
This new variety has achieved a record-breaking high yield, despite adverse weather conditions such as heavy rainfall and lack of sunlight this year. The success can be attributed to the superior traits of this millet variety, including lodging resistance, high productivity and excellent disease and stress tolerance, along with the use of optimized planting techniques that further enhanced its performance, according to experts.
This achievement lays the foundation for scientific breeding, the exploration of new cultivation techniques and further development of the millet industry, offering a model for increasing millet yields on a large scale, said Diao Xianmin, a researcher with the ICS and leading scientist of China's millet and sorghum industry and technology system.
Foxtail millet is one of the oldest domesticated crops in the world and a staple crop in the formation of the Asian agricultural civilization and it held a dominant position in the Chinese agricultural system before the introduction of high-input agricultural practices like irrigation and chemical fertilizers. Moreover, because it is a crop that can grow across a wide range of environments, including arid lands, it has the potential to be important for food security under climate change, according to experts.
The new variety is suitable for spring planting in regions like Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning and Jilin, and for summer planting in areas such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong and Beijing, Diao said.

HEFEI, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- A drone hovered above a home appliance industrial park in eastern Chinese city of Wuhu, Anhui Province. Equipped with several detection devices running in sync, it efficiently fed real-time production scenes back to the ""smart brain"" using a 5G network.
""Every manufacturing process is working to improve quality and efficiency,"" said Guo Kexiong, digital director of the Midea Kitchen and Heating Intelligent Home Appliance Industrial Park.
After a decade of fierce price competition, the profit margins for ordinary household appliance makers in China have dwindled considerably, positioning the sector as a more conventional industry.
Yet, the integration of smart technology is igniting a transformative revolution that presents new opportunities for the country's home appliance manufacturers to survive and thrive.
SMART MANUFACTURING
Hefei, the capital city of Anhui, is now home to two ""lighthouse factories"" for home appliances -- Media Group's laundry machine plant and Haier's air conditioner plant. Lighthouse factories are plants recognized by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for their leadership in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. By 2023, of WEF's 153 lighthouses across the globe, 62 are based in China.
Haier's plant, included into the WEF list last year, is the world's first lighthouse factory for home central air conditioning appliances. In this factory, the hustle and bustle of production workers has given way to cameras that can ""see through"" the interior of parts, while inspectors wearing AI glasses patrol the facility in an orderly manner.
Advanced algorithms, digital twins and knowledge graphs have been integrated into the research and development, production and testing processes of home central air conditioning units, leading to a significant improvement in product quality and production efficiency.
The Haier Hefei factory has pioneered an innovative platform that integrates big data technology with ant colony optimization (ACO), sparing the traditional trial-and-error methods.
As a result, the factory has seen a 58 percent decrease in product defect rates, a 49 percent increase in per capita efficiency and a 22 percent reduction in manufacturing costs per unit. Additionally, it has achieved a significant reduction of 447,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually in manufacturing processes.
According to the white paper released by the WEF in December 2023 titled ""Global Lighthouse Network: Adopting AI at Speed and Scale,"" the newly recognized lighthouses in 2023 have implemented AI with high impact across every step of the supply chain.
Meiling, a renowned refrigerator maker in China, was once on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1980s. It made a remarkable turnaround by shifting to refrigerator manufacturing. Now, Meiling stands at a new crossroads, striving to embrace intelligent technologies to revitalize the traditional industry.
The fridge-maker has built an industrial internet platform called ""Lingyun,"" which integrates over 1,700 upstream and downstream enterprises into a unified online system, connecting approximately 24,000 industrial equipment terminals.
""This approach addresses common issues across the industrial chain,"" said Hu Mingyong, director of the Intelligent Manufacturing Institute at Changhong Meiling Co., Ltd.
China aims to accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing industries. It is targeting a penetration rate of digital R&D and design tools above 90 percent and a numerical control rate of critical processes above 70 percent by the year 2027.
SMART APPLIANCES
Meanwhile, the burgeoning industry also provides a glimpse into the future of smart homes and the potential for a more connected and convenient way of living in China.
Smart homes and related industries have emerged as new growth areas in the country. From January to July, the retail sales of energy-efficient and smart home appliances grew at a nearly double-digit rate, significantly outpacing the average level of home appliances and audio-visual equipment categories, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
This development comes as China has introduced subsidies for home appliance products, promoting the upgrading of these traditionally manufactured goods to become smarter and more environmentally friendly.
On display in stores are innovative appliances like gas stoves with integrated screens that display instructional cooking videos, garment care machines offering both ultraviolet sterilization and gentle drying, and treadmills with built-in cameras that provide real-time feedback on the runner's form.
At IFA Berlin 2024, the world's leading trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances, which was held earlier this month, Haier displayed its new smart products, which utilize the Internet of Things and AI technologies to enable seamless connectivity between household appliances.
Its smart refrigerator can automatically adjust the temperature based on the stored food, extending the shelf life. Users can also remotely control and manage home appliances. Haier's smart washing machine employs AI algorithms to optimize washing modes, saving water and electricity while protecting the fabric of the clothes.
According to an industry report by JD.com, one of China's largest e-commerce platform, home appliances such as panoramic cameras, multi-function cookers, fruit and vegetable washers and facial steamers saw their sales surge more than tenfold year on year on the platform in 2023.
Also, the market share of high-end products, in categories like integrated stoves, dry cleaners and dishwashers, increased by 40 percent to 70 percent at brick-and-mortar stores that year, according to the report.

The Haier Hefei factory has pioneered an innovative platform that integrates big data technology with ant colony optimization (ACO), sparing the traditional trial-and-error methods.
As a result, the factory has seen a 58 percent decrease in product defect rates, a 49 percent increase in per capita efficiency and a 22 percent reduction in manufacturing costs per unit. Additionally, it has achieved a significant reduction of 447,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually in manufacturing processes.
According to the white paper released by the WEF in December 2023 titled ""Global Lighthouse Network: Adopting AI at Speed and Scale,"" the newly recognized lighthouses in 2023 have implemented AI with high impact across every step of the supply chain.
Meiling, a renowned refrigerator maker in China, was once on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1980s. It made a remarkable turnaround by shifting to refrigerator manufacturing. Now, Meiling stands at a new crossroads, striving to embrace intelligent technologies to revitalize the traditional industry.
The fridge-maker has built an industrial internet platform called ""Lingyun,"" which integrates over 1,700 upstream and downstream enterprises into a unified online system, connecting approximately 24,000 industrial equipment terminals.
""This approach addresses common issues across the industrial chain,"" said Hu Mingyong, director of the Intelligent Manufacturing Institute at Changhong Meiling Co., Ltd.
China aims to accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing industries. It is targeting a penetration rate of digital R&D and design tools above 90 percent and a numerical control rate of critical processes above 70 percent by the year 2027.
SMART APPLIANCES
Meanwhile, the burgeoning industry also provides a glimpse into the future of smart homes and the potential for a more connected and convenient way of living in China.
Smart homes and related industries have emerged as new growth areas in the country. From January to July, the retail sales of energy-efficient and smart home appliances grew at a nearly double-digit rate, significantly outpacing the average level of home appliances and audio-visual equipment categories, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
This development comes as China has introduced subsidies for home appliance products, promoting the upgrading of these traditionally manufactured goods to become smarter and more environmentally friendly.
On display in stores are innovative appliances like gas stoves with integrated screens that display instructional cooking videos, garment care machines offering both ultraviolet sterilization and gentle drying, and treadmills with built-in cameras that provide real-time feedback on the runner's form.
At IFA Berlin 2024, the world's leading trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances, which was held earlier this month, Haier displayed its new smart products, which utilize the Internet of Things and AI technologies to enable seamless connectivity between household appliances.
Its smart refrigerator can automatically adjust the temperature based on the stored food, extending the shelf life. Users can also remotely control and manage home appliances. Haier's smart washing machine employs AI algorithms to optimize washing modes, saving water and electricity while protecting the fabric of the clothes.
According to an industry report by JD.com, one of China's largest e-commerce platform, home appliances such as panoramic cameras, multi-function cookers, fruit and vegetable washers and facial steamers saw their sales surge more than tenfold year on year on the platform in 2023.
Also, the market share of high-end products, in categories like integrated stoves, dry cleaners and dishwashers, increased by 40 percent to 70 percent at brick-and-mortar stores that year, according to the report.

"China Focus: Smart tech to empower tourism, enhance experience of foreign visitors",2024-09-15,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0915/c90000-20219875.html,"Home>>
		
China Focus: Smart tech to empower tourism, enhance experience of foreign visitors
 (Xinhua) 15:26, September 15, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- At the ongoing 2024 China International Fair for Trade in Services in Beijing, China is witnessing a surge in the use of smart technologies in its tourism industry, highlighting the potential to provide the growing number of foreign tourists with greater convenience and more immersive journeys.
In addition to a humanoid robot with bobbed hair that speaks multiple languages, virtual try-on machines that generate stylized images for tourists at popular scenic spots, and mini-apps that automatically create customized itineraries, a wide range of innovative technologies have come into the spotlight, all promising to unlock the competitiveness of Chinese tourism among global tourists.
Swift payments have a significant impact on the overall experience of inbound tourists. To tackle payment inconvenience among foreign visitors, China's State Council released a guideline on improving payment services in March, pointing out the direction for further facilitating payment for foreigners through technical improvements.
At a special payment services counter at the fair, established with the joint efforts of Weixin Pay, the digital payment service of Chinese technology company Tencent, foreign exhibitors can learn about China's upgraded payment services in 12 different languages.
""Participants from Spain, Mongolia, the Maldives and Norway have all come to us to learn about how to add their bank cards and use QR codes to pay for things in China,"" said Qin Tianxiong, a product manager of Weixin Pay international cards service.
To better cater to international visitors, Weixin Pay further streamlined its services in February of this year, allowing inbound tourists to add international bank cards to their WeChat accounts by simply entering a card number, expiry date and security code, while requiring no identification information for payments no more than 2,000 U.S. dollars, according to Qin.
As tens of millions of merchants accept Weixin Pay, Qin said that the upgraded services have benefited over 1 million foreigners.
Compared with the data before the services were improved in July 2023, the total amount of transactions made by foreign tourists through Weixin Pay in China this July increased more than fourfold, and the number of transactions almost quadrupled, according to Qin.
Tourists from around the world can now pay for various services with ease, including accommodation, transportation, dining and entertainment services, without needing to open a bank account in China. A simple scan of the e-payment code is all that is required.
In 2023, China recorded 82 million inbound tourist arrivals, and the country is expected to return to its 2019 visitor level by 2026, according to a green paper on China's inbound tourism, which was released by the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) and the World Tourism Cities Federation at a tourism conference held on the sidelines of the fair.
""We can provide a wide range of payment methods to ensure that foreign visitors can have a smooth journey while visiting China. We will make their journey convenient and hassle-free,"" Qin said.
Combining traditional Chinese culture with modern technology in the context of tourism is also a key topic that is drawing the attention of enterprises.
There is an urgent need for China, a country with a rich and extensive history spanning over 5,000 years, to provide inbound tourists with a more participative and engaging tourism experience, particularly for the younger generations, according to Peter Semone, chairman of PATA.
Optical motion capture, an advanced technology utilized in the creation of the popular Chinese video game ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" has demonstrated strong potential in addressing the need.
In the exhibition hall of the trade fair, a young man dressed in a black jumpsuit was seen vigorously waving a wooden stick, while multiple cameras snapped images. His every movement was being captured and transformed into a series of bold actions by the virtual monkey king displayed on the big screen behind him.
The secret of the quick capture of performance lies within the cameras positioned around the actor and the markers attached to the actor's body. As the camera captures the reflective markers, the movements of real-world characters can be digitally translated into swift and smooth running, jumping and sprinting movements in the virtual world.
Liu Yaodong, chairman and CEO of Beijing Virtual Point Technology Co., Ltd., a leading company in space calculation and optical motion capture, has noticed the huge space for motion tracking in China's tourism industry.
A virtual reality project at a museum in central China's Hunan Province is a prime example. By employing 66 motion capture cameras and a set of customized cultural relics props, museum visitors are granted the opportunity to embark on a journey back to ancient times, during which they can engage in interactions with ancient artifacts.
""With motion capture, foreign tourists have the opportunity to engage with natural landscapes and cultural relics, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of China's rich history, culture and picturesque landscapes,"" Liu said.
Just displaying beautiful old cultural relics from thousands of years ago might result in aesthetic fatigue among inbound tourists, said Semone. ""I think this is an opportunity for China to allow the tourists to start to engage a bit more in the culture,"" he said.
Semone added that China, with its vast market and extensive experience in managing a significant influx of tourists, has the potential to not only benefit from inbound travel but also export smart technologies to enhance global tourism.

High-speed rail showcasing China's rapid modernization
By Liu Zhiqiang, Li Xinping (People's Daily) 15:25, September 14, 2024
China's railway sector has achieved leapfrog development over the past decades, as evidenced by a range of impressive statistics.
In an hour, the Fuxing bullet train travels 350 kilometers, making it the fastest train service in the world. Besides, China is developing a new high-speed train model CR450, which will be able to operate at speeds of 400 kilometers per hour, showing strong innovation dynamism.

In a single day, China's railway network transports over 10 million passengers, making it the busiest rail system globally. These bustling services demonstrate China's vitality, with the railway network reaching 99 percent of cities across the country, each with a population of over 200,000, and the high-speed rail network covering 96 percent of cities, each with a population surpassing 500,000.
In a year, China's modern railway network expands by about 3,600 kilometers, marking the most significant growth worldwide. China has built the most modern railway system and the most advanced high-speed rail network in the world. The operating mileage of China's railway network is expected to surpass 160,000 kilometers, and the total length of China's operating high-speed rail tracks is set to approach 46,000 kilometers, the longest in the world.
In front of the archive of the China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited (CARS), there is a 100-meter-long railway track made up of different types of sleepers.
""Each kind of sleepers used in China's railway, starting from wood and cement to integral track beds, marks significant milestones in the country's railway modernization,"" said Li Xuefeng, general manager of CARS.
""The goal of building 160,000 kilometers of railway, a vision proposed over a century ago, is now becoming a reality in the new era,” said Fu Meisheng, deputy head of the China Railway Museum.
The newly launched high-speed railways in China are equipped with state-of-the-art heavy-duty tracks to accommodate the speed of 350 kilometers per hour, with each track spanning 100 meters.

""If you want the trains to be fast and steady, it is necessary to use 100-meter heavy-duty tracks and reduce the number of welding lines on the tracks,"" said Zeng Xianhai, head of the department of track, communication & signaling and power supply of China Railway.
To extend 25-meter steel rails to 100-meter heavy-duty tracks, Chinese enterprises, universities and research institutes have collaborated extensively, achieving more than 100 technology patents in China and around the world.
For instance, to overcome the challenge, the CARS performed extensive tests to find the best technical parameters for the tracks. Leading steel companies in China have collaborated on research and development and conducted trial production at the same time.
Today, China's high-speed heavy-duty rails boast world-leading performance, with a straightness deviation of no more than the thickness of three A4 sheets per meter.
A high-speed train running at 350 kilometers per hour consists of approximately 40,000 parts, with the network control system considered the train's ""brain."" China used to rely on foreign technology in this regard, which limited the technological iteration and advancement of the trains.
To tackle the technological challenge, China Railway managed to develop the testing platform and produce network chips independently. From technical documents to system architecture, from diverse hardware specifications to component testing and code debugging, it took five years for the company to break through key technologies of this network control system.

Today, this advanced, independently developed ""brain"" boasts a data transmission speed 60 times higher than existing products, with a transmission capacity 100 times greater. It is reported that of the 254 important standards adopted by the Fuxing bullet train, 84 percent are Chinese standards.
Innovation knows no bounds. The prototype of the next-generation Fuxing bullet train CR450 is being manufactured on the production lines of China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation's Changchun and Qingdao bases. It will roll off the assembly line later this year, expected to break new ground in several areas of high-speed railway technology.
The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway marks the first time that all systems, all elements, and the entire industrial chain of China's high-speed railway are landed overseas. It also serves as a vivid example of China's openness and inclusiveness.
During the railway's construction, over 75 percent of services and procurement are local to Indonesia, creating 51,000 jobs for local communities. During the operation, China provided on-site training for over 160 local drivers and technicians. The project has significantly boosted the development of Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway economic belt, serving as the path to prosperity and happiness for local communities.
Chinese railway technology is rapidly advancing on a global level, contributing Chinese wisdom to the global modernization. For instance, China-Europe freight trains have reached 223 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries. The China-Laos Railway has transported over 4.3 million tons of cargo since it was put into operation in 2021.
So far, China's high-speed railway network has handled a total of over 20 billion passenger trips. More than 8,700 Fuxing bullet trains are in operation every day in China. Known for its exceptional safety performance, China's high-speed railway network is widely recognized as the safest railway system worldwide.

China's super microscope broadens understanding on how cells interact in mammals
 (Xinhua) 14:55, September 14, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists crafted a super intravital microscope that is capable of seeing clearly the entire three-dimensional (3D) interactions of a large-scale cell's network at the mammalian organ level.
The instrument, developed by Tsinghua University, is designed to enhance innovative research in oncology, immunology and neuroscience, in order to provide a systemic understanding on how organs are organized and functioning at the single cell resolution.
This microscope called the RUSH3D system offers a centimeter-scale field of view and subcellular resolution. It is capable of high-speed 3D imaging at a rate of 20 frames per second, while also enabling continuous observation for dozens of hours with low toxicity, according to the study published on Friday in the journal Cell.
In neuroscience, for instance, the intricate interactions among a large population of neurons are responsible for complex functions like intelligence and consciousness. Understanding the architecture and operational dynamics of neural circuits is crucial for deciphering the inner workings of the brain.
The research team utilized the system to achieve high-speed 3D observation covering layers of the cerebral cortex in live mice at single-cell resolution.
They captured the distinct response patterns of various cortical regions under multi-sensory stimulation and tracked large-scale neural responses with single-neuron precision across several consecutive days, according to the study.
""The traditional fluorescence microscopy allowed us to observe only part of an organ, such as a specific brain region in a mouse,"" said Dai Qionghai, the paper's corresponding author from Tsinghua University.
""The RUSH3D system, however, is akin to using 100 microscopes simultaneously, providing complete coverage of the mouse cortex and capturing the dynamic interactions of hundreds of thousands of neurons,"" said Dai.

How a made-in-China refrigerator reduces carbon footprint
By Lin Lili (People's Daily) 14:08, September 14, 2024
A ""smart"" refrigerator made in China has recently been granted an online product carbon footprint certificate from the China Quality Certification Center, the first of its kind issued by the center.
The refrigerator, made by Qingdao Haier Refrigeration Appliance Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Chinese home appliance giant Haier, can automatically adjust energy consumption based on the food volume it stores.

The certificate tracks the carbon emissions of the refrigerator across different stages, including raw material sourcing, production, distribution, usage, and disposal.
Refrigerants are an essential raw material for refrigerators. In the past, freon was commonly used as a refrigerant, but when released into the atmosphere, it causes ozone depletion.
""We are focusing on low-carbon alternatives for insulation materials in refrigeration equipment, and collaborating with suppliers to promote the use of environmentally friendly refrigerants and other new technologies to reduce fluorine emissions,"" said an executive with the company.
According to the executive, this frost-free refrigerator prioritizes the use of renewable, recyclable, and eco-friendly materials with minimal environmental impact. It exceeds Chinese national standards by being over 90 percent recyclable.
""Insulation foaming is one of the most critical processes in refrigerator manufacturing. We adopted innovative foaming technology to fill the space between the inner and outer walls of the refrigerator, significantly improving insulation performance and energy efficiency,"" said Hou Tingyi, an executive with the company.
Around Hou, many refrigerators are being manufactured on the production line. ""Look, each of the refrigerators has five material injection guns working on its back simultaneously. We use a cutting-edge high-precision flexible injection technology that allows for multi-point injection, an upgrade from the previous single-point injection method. This technology can help reduce the use of foam material by 5 percent, increase the refrigerator's volume by 15 percent, and cut energy consumption by 3 percent,"" said Hou.

In the distribution phase, the company has been able to reduce carbon emissions more efficiently across the entire process of warehousing, transportation and delivery by adopting new technologies such as smart warehousing, intelligent logistics, and eco-friendly packaging.
In the warehousing stage, unmanned operations have reportedly been implemented in multiple Chinese smart warehouses, which allow for automatic reception and dispatching of large items. The warehouses do not even need lighting, thus saving electricity.
In the transportation stage, an intelligent logistics system can automatically optimize delivery routes, while using new energy vehicles to reduce carbon emissions.
In the delivery stage, with a primary focus on biodegradable or recyclable green packaging materials, the company used reusable packaging while reducing the use of cardboard boxes to minimize the consumption of packaging materials.
Overall, by adopting reusable packaging materials, the company has reduced foam plastic usage by 32 percent and cardboard material usage by 83 percent.
More than 80 percent of a refrigerator's total carbon emissions come from its operational phase. How can carbon emissions be reduced during this phase? This challenge tests the product's design and technology.
It is learned that this smart refrigerator is equipped with multi-dimensional sensors that can detect changes in internal and external conditions. Based on data collected by the sensors, energy consumption can be reduced through an intelligent algorithm.

""We have accumulated refrigerator manufacturing data in the past 40 years and built a big database and energy-saving models. By using different parameter combinations based on the refrigerator's load, we dynamically match the most suitable cooling conditions, which saves about 15 percent more energy than single-mode refrigerators,"" said Chen Jianquan, an executive with the company.
A refrigerator's service life is typically 10 to 15 years. When the refrigerator reaches the end of its life cycle, users can submit recycling or trade-in requests through different channels, such as the official app or mini-programs. Within 48 hours of placing an order, service personnel will collect the old refrigerator.
""The dismantled raw materials will re-enter the industrial chain in a new form,"" said Li Xiuqing, general manager of the company's home appliance recycling division. For example, plastic goes through dozens of processes, including cleaning, sorting, granulation, and modification. The purity of the recycled new material can reach 99.9 percent, enabling high-value applications across sectors such as home appliances, automobiles, and everyday chemicals.
According to statistics, an old refrigerator with a volume of around 220 liters can yield about nine kilograms of plastic, 38.6 kilograms of iron, 0.6 kilograms of aluminum, and 1.4 kilograms of copper when dismantled. Recycling 10,000 refrigerators can reduce carbon emissions by 65 tons.

In a light drizzle, two playful Yangtze finless porpoises darted through the waters of Xin-Luo Baiji National Nature Reserve, occasionally surfacing as they hunted for fish. The Global Times observed their rewilding process in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province.
The Yangtze finless porpoise, famous for its playful smile and intelligence comparable to that of a 3-4-year-old child, is a small mammal native to China's Yangtze River. As a top-level protected species, it serves as a unique symbol of the river and a key indicator of its health.
Balancing the economic development of the Yangtze River with the survival of endangered species remains a critical priority. ""Overfishing has led to many porpoises getting trapped in nets, while the noise from boats disrupts their echolocation, making it difficult for them to find food,"" Wang Ding, president of the Wuhan Baiji Conservation Foundation (WBCF) and research professor at the Institute of Hydrobiology (HIB) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday.
Human activities have caused a sharp decline in the Yangtze finless porpoise population, leaving only around 1,012 individuals by July 2018. To combat this decline, conservation institutes have relocated some porpoises to safer areas for ex-situ conservation. In these controlled environments, they are trained to improve foraging skills and monitored for reproduction, before being reintroduced into the more complex waters of the Yangtze River.
Resulting from a 10-year fishing ban in the Yangtze waters since 2021 and scientific measures, the population had increased to 1,249 in 2022, a 23.4 percent rise over five years, with an average annual growth rate of 4.3 percent, marking initial success in conservation efforts, according to official data.
High-tech protection
Advanced technologies play a crucial role in tracking the population and living conditions of the Yangtze finless porpoise. ""Our monitoring system has been in place for 20 years, but intelligent detection technology has only been introduced in recent years,"" Wang told the Global Times on Friday.
Wang noted the current intelligent monitoring system allows 24/7 automated surveillance, complementing traditional methods by enabling long-term monitoring of animal activity in specific areas. By accurately identifying porpoise vocal signals, the system analyzes their frequency and direction, providing essential data for research and conservation. Additionally, it can automatically deploy drones to monitor the animals when they surface, enhancing real-time observation and protection efforts, according to Wang.
""The intelligent system first put in place in 2022 allows for more accurate monitoring of the porpoise population. We aim to make it smarter and expand its coverage,"" Hu Hongxia, head of the finance department at Tian'ezhou Nature Reserve, told the Global Times on Friday.
High-tech equipment has also been developed to help the rewilding process of porpoises. ""We fitted the rewilded porpoises with small, lightweight, detachable vests. Using satellite tracking and radio signals, we monitored their adaptation and integration after release. Within days, they showed no signs of discomfort and quickly joined the group,"" said Mei Zhigang, deputy secretary-general of the WBCF and associate researcher at HIB.
Mei noted that because the vests can easily detach, they have implanted tiny, rice-sized microchips in the rewilded porpoises for long-term tracking. So far, four porpoises have been successfully released, marking a global first in rewilding an endangered aquatic mammal and showcasing China's unique contribution to biodiversity conservation.
Digital support
In addition to high-tech monitoring, raising public awareness about porpoise conservation through digital outreach is equally important. The Wuhan government, in collaboration with other agencies and businesses, launched a digital Yangtze porpoise IP, created the ""iPorpoise"" WeChat mini-program, and produced porpoise-themed merchandise.
The live stream of the Yangtze finless porpoise ""Xiao Jiujiu"" giving birth in 2022, co-hosted by the WBCF and Xinhua, garnered over 220 million views, while the global naming campaign for ""Hanbao"" attracted 100 million participants. These events highlight the growing public interest in Yangtze porpoise conservation, showcasing how digital platforms can effectively engage and inspire support for endangered species.
China's tech giant, Lenovo, officially announced on Thursday that it has adopted a female Yangtze finless porpoise undergoing rewilding training, named No. 1575, making it the first company to adopt a porpoise.
Lenovo unveiled a digital avatar and merchandise inspired by the Yangtze finless porpoise ""No. 1575"" and, in collaboration with relevant government agencies and businesses, developed a soon-to-be-released digital ""Porpoise Tracking Map"".
Liu Wei, director of Smart Devices and Solutions at Lenovo Research, said the initiative aims to raise public awareness of endangered species, promoting conservation efforts and shifting the focus from ex-situ conservation to the broader goal of restoring wild populations.
Lenovo will apply AI technology to monitor and study the Yangtze finless porpoise, offering data to support rewilding and habitat restoration efforts. Their smart devices are also helping teams work more efficiently, Liu said.
Balancing economic development, technological progress, and environmental harmony has been a long-standing challenge for humanity. ""We will continue to prioritize a people-centered approach, exploring advanced technologies that promote harmony with nature. As a tech company, we are committed to contributing to biodiversity conservation and improving the well-being of society,"" Liu said.
In early 2024, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment released the China Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2023-2030), making biodiversity protection a national priority. In August, four ministries issued the 2023 Report on Aquatic Resources and Habitats in the Yangtze River Basin. Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs emphasized the urgency of protecting endangered species in the Yangtze River.
The greater collaboration between the government, research institutions, and businesses is essential to safeguarding these vulnerable species like the Yangtze finless porpoises.

According to the booth staff, this human-machine interaction system could be utilized with any machine equipped with a programmable logic controller, allowing users to check machine status as casually as having a conversation, without physical operations or code inputs.
During the summit, the vast potential of AI technology for improving the life of humanity is evident.

However, company representatives told Xinhua that most companies have concentrated mainly on European and North American markets, making AI services seem quite far off for many developing countries, particularly those struggling financially.
According to Deemah Al-Yahya, secretary-general of the Digital Cooperation Organization based in Riyadh, AI projects require significant amounts of energy. Addressing the energy constraints that hinder AI development poses a challenge even for developed countries, let alone for impoverished nations that cannot reliably secure their daily electricity supply, she noted.
""The uneven digital landscape threatens to create an AI divide further magnified by the existing digital divide, leading to a new form of exclusion... We need cooperative actions to ensure AI bridges these divides rather than making them worse,"" she said.
""We need global coordination to build safe and inclusive AI that is accessible to all,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres previously appealed, echoing a similar sentiment.

On July 1, the 78th UN General Assembly reached a historic consensus by adopting a resolution spearheaded by China on enhancing international cooperation for AI capacity building, with over 140 countries saying yes.
This resolution outlines a series of practical measures to strengthen international collaboration, intending to help all countries, especially developing ones, benefit equally from AI development, bridge the digital divide, improve global AI governance, and accelerate the fulfillment of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As Vilas Dhar, president and trustee of Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, a nonprofit focused on AI, has said, ""The future of AI should belong to all humanity.""

KUNMING, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- In a country with a rich tea-drinking tradition spanning thousands of years, China saw its first cohort of university students majoring in coffee science and engineering start the new semester in September.
This groundbreaking initiative at Yunnan Agricultural University (YAU) aims to provide undergraduate training in coffee-related expertise to meet the growing demand for professionals in a country where coffee consumption is rapidly rising.
A total of 100 students have enrolled in the program this year. They will study at the university's campus in Pu'er City in the southwest Yunnan Province, where the first coffee seeds were introduced around 130 years ago.
Speaking to Xinhua, Chen Siyuan said that her interest in coffee started when she was a grade 12 student preparing for the university entrance exam.
""I need something refreshing to help me focus on my studies, so I chose coffee for its stimulating effect,"" she said, adding that the more she learned about coffee, the more it fascinated her.
Chen's father, who was involved in the coffee industry, also inspired her to pursue a major in coffee science and engineering.
After attending her first class this week, she realized the major was more challenging than she had expected. ""Hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to further study coffee tasting, technology and trade,"" she said.
Shen Yize, from Hebei Province in northern China, began drinking coffee for the same reason -- to stay refreshed while studying. He started with instant coffee and gradually learned more about the beverage and the culture behind it.
""Today in class, I saw the entire process of how raw beans are transformed into a cup of coffee for the first time,"" he said, adding that he also found friends in his department who share his passion for coffee.
During their four years in college, undergraduates will take foundational courses like math, chemistry and English. After introductory classes on coffee, they will advance to specialized courses such as coffee flavor chemistry, coffee engineering principles, roasting and evaluation, and world coffee trade. They are also encouraged to pursue certifications, like the Q-Grader exam.
""From metropolises to small cities in China you can always see a lot of cafes, but we lack professionals who know both coffee growing and production, as well as sales,"" said Chen Shiwei who is in charge of the major in the College of Tropical Crops at YAU.
He noted that they want to cultivate interdisciplinary talent in the coffee sector to support the high-quality development of China's coffee industry.
China surpassed the United States last year to become the country with the most coffee outlets in the world. It has now emerged as East Asia's fastest-growing market for coffee consumption. Between 2010 and 2022, coffee consumption per person in China rose fourfold, according to the International Coffee Organization.
Yunnan, China's largest coffee-producing region, accounts for about 98 percent of the country's coffee production, with Pu'er -- known as China's ""coffee capital"" -- producing half of Yunnan's total output.
According to Yang Xuehu, head of the College of Tropical Crops, Pu'er was chosen as the site for the coffee science and engineering major because the city boasts a complete coffee industry chain, from seed to cup.
The college has partnered with over 20 institutions, including the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences and coffee giant Nestl, to create off-campus practice bases. They have also established international cooperation with universities in Thailand and New Zealand to broaden the horizon of students.
""China has both coffee-producing areas and a huge consumer market so students pursuing this major have the opportunity to learn about the entire industrial chain,"" said Zhao Xuemei, head of brand communication, innovation and renovation at Nestl China, noting that as the coffee industry's potential continues to expand, the demand for skilled professionals is increasing significantly.
Liu Haifeng, executive deputy general manager of the Yunnan International Coffee Exchange, expressed high expectations for the undergraduate program in coffee studies.
He said he hopes that by studying at the university, students will gain insights into industry trends and develop the skills to create new products and technologies for coffee. ""In the future baristas might be replaced by machines, but those who design the machines will not be replaced.""
The university newcomer Chen Siyuan shares similar sentiments. ""In the future, I hope to uncover the mysteries of coffee that remain unsolved and engage in a deeper exploration of this beverage through my studies,"" she said.

Ultra fast maglev train clears trial in Shanxi,2024-09-13,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0913/c90000-20219034.html,"Home>>
		
Ultra fast maglev train clears trial in Shanxi

A novel ultra high-speed maglev transportation system under development recently passed a trial run in Datong, Shanxi province.
The successful demonstration test brings the train another step closer to market, where it could significantly reduce travel times and boost cross-regional economic exchanges.
With a maximum designed speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour, the T-flight system is about three times faster than current high-speed trains and even faster than airplanes. If put into operation, travel time between Beijing and Shanghai will be shortened to about an hour, a fraction of the time of the current fastest train trip between the metropolises — 4 hours and 18 minutes — and about half as long as a flight, which takes roughly two hours.
""As socioeconomic development continues, people's demand for faster, more comfortable transportation is increasing,"" said Zhao Ming, a technician from the Institute of Maglev and Electromagnetic Propulsion of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, which develops the train. ""The T-flight will play a role in creating a 'one-hour economic circle' among core urban clusters in China, and together with high-speed rail, civil aviation and other modes of transportation, it will form a comprehensive three-dimensional transportation network in the country.""
The train's ultra high speed is due to a low vacuum tube and magnetic levitation system, which enables it to achieve ""near-ground flight"" — a revolutionary technology, he said at the China (Taiyuan) International Energy Industry Expo 2024 in Taiyuan, Shanxi, on Wednesday.
By extracting air from the tube to create a low vacuum environment, the train can operate with minimal air resistance. At the same time, maglev technology ensures the train and the track keep from touching, further reducing frictional resistance. The combination of the vacuum and maglev technology increases the train's speed and also reduces noise and vibration, according to Zhao.
The superconductive maglev technology used in the project can elevate the train by 100 millimeters — compared with the 10 mm separation currently used in maglev trains operating in China — to increase speed and stability, he added.
Since its launch in September 2021, the project has made significant progress. During the recent test conducted in Yanggao county, Datong, once the project team established a low vacuum environment within a 2-km tube, the maglev train set off along the designed route, maintained stable levitation and safely came to a stop.
The maximum speed and levitation height met the preset values, all systems worked correctly, and the actual trajectory matched well with the theoretical one, meaning the experiment was successful, according to the company.
