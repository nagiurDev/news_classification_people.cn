China's Fengyun meteorological satellites contribute to global disaster prevention, mitigation
 (People's Daily Online) 13:52, January 12, 2024
Dubbed ""the satellites closest to the people's daily lives,” China's homegrown Fengyun meteorological satellites monitor meteorological conditions on the planet 24/7, making important contributions to global disaster prevention and mitigation efforts.
Since the launch of China's first meteorological satellite in 1988, the country has successfully sent 21 Fengyun meteorological satellites of two generations into space. Nine of them are currently in orbit, providing data and products for 129 countries and regions around the world.

From simply ""taking photos"" of the atmosphere to ""performing computed tomography (CT) scans"" of the atmosphere, Fengyun satellites have evolved from lagging behind internationally to running alongside, and even leading the way in some areas.
China is the only country in the world that operates four near-Earth orbit meteorological satellites simultaneously—covering dawn, morning, afternoon, and oblique orbits.
With multiple satellites in orbit conducting networked observations, the country's Fengyun meteorological satellites are able to provide three dimensional, quantitative, global, all-weather, all-day, hyper-spectral, and timely precision monitoring data. They have become the backbone of the global network of Earth observation satellites.
Fengyun satellites are widely applied in such fields as weather forecasting, climate prediction, natural disaster and environmental monitoring, scientific research, and various industries including meteorology, oceanography, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, aviation and aerospace.
They have contributed significantly to disaster prevention, climate change response and sustainable economic and social development.
In July 2023, after Typhoon Doksuri was formed in the northwest Pacific Ocean, Fengyun satellites monitored the typhoon throughout its life cycle, providing strong support to decision making at thematic consultations on the typhoon and rainstorms, as well as the accurate monitoring of extremely heavy rainfall triggered by the typhoon.
In recent years, data obtained from instruments on the Fengyun meteorological satellites have been playing an increasingly important role in the data assimilation of the numerical weather prediction models of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), according to Niels Bormann, a Principal Scientist in the ECMWF Research Department.
In the past few years, Fengyun meteorological satellites have been used to monitor extreme drought events in Central Asia and facilitate studies on drought mechanisms, climate change and its impacts, identify affected areas, and then help these areas reduce adverse impacts and enhance climate resilience, said Sanjarbek Muratov, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) representative to Uzbekistan.
In November 2023, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) launched the international version of FengYun Earth, a Fengyun meteorological satellite-based platform, to provide customized services to international users.
The platform satisfies the specific requirements of users by providing more than 100 products in five categories covering cloud pictures, key elements, disaster events, climate, and model verification.
In an effort to better serve international users, the CMA established an emergency support mechanism on disaster prevention and mitigation for international users of Fengyun satellites in April 2018. A total of 34 countries had registered for the mechanism by 2023.
Since 2023, Fengyun satellites have responded 28 times to global demands for emergency support services. They have observed tropical cyclones Lola and Mocha, providing meteorological support to countries like Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Bangladesh.
The satellites have also helped monitor concentrated ignition points of devastating forest fires from the northern coast of Algeria to northwest Tunisia, offering important assistance for the fire prevention and control efforts of local authorities.
Over the past five years, the CMA has trained more than 1,000 international users to better use the products of Fengyun meteorological satellites, and provided support for the application software for Fengyun satellites' remote sensing services, and held video consultations on relevant services and products for over 20 countries and regions more than 50 times, according to statistics from the CMA.
The ""circle of friends' of Fengyun satellites will be further expanded through international cooperation and multilateral and bilateral exchanges, reliable sources said.
China's National Satellite Meteorological Center (NSMC) is going to deepen international market research for Fengyun satellites, actively take part in international exchanges with foreign counterparts, and enhance international cooperation with other operators of meteorological satellites, said Wang Jingsong, director general of the NSMC.
""We will work with our international peers to further advance sci-tech innovations for Fengyun satellites to better serve global disaster prevention and mitigation efforts, jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind, and contribute Chinese solutions to the goal of the sustainable development of human society,"" he noted.

Scientists identify immune cells as potential target in cancer treatment
 (Xinhua) 13:42, January 12, 2024
SHANGHAI, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese and Singaporean scientists have determined that a type of common immune cell could become an accomplice aiding cancer, and therefore it might be useful to target it in a potential anti-cancer therapy.
Neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cell population in the body and which serve as first responders to infection and injury and also tend to gather around tumors, are shown to support tumor growth, according to the study published on Friday in the journal Science.
Using an experimental pancreatic cancer mouse model, the researchers from Renji Hospital under Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and Singapore Immunology Network, found that when infiltrated by a tumor, neutrophils are modified into a long-lived cell subset called T3.
These T3 cells become ""traitors"" to the body by promoting the growth of new blood vessels, which help the tumor survive in areas with low oxygen and limited nutrients. Depleting T3 cells or weakening their ability to function can inhibit tumor growth, according to the study.
""This discovery can be used to develop immunotherapeutic strategies targeting neutrophils, which can inhibit their tumor-promoting effects while retaining their basic immune functions by intervening in their pathological reprogramming process,"" said Zhang Zemin, a professor of Peking University, who was not involved in the study.

Freshwater snail species spotted in south China after over 100 years,2024-01-12,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0112/c90000-20121234.html,"Home>>
		
Freshwater snail species spotted in south China after over 100 years
 (Xinhua) 13:36, January 12, 2024
KUNMING, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of international scientists has rediscovered a sessile freshwater snail endemic to China after it had disappeared for more than 100 years.
The discovery was made jointly by researchers from institutions including the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany, and China's Peking University, according to the latest edition of the biological research journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.
The snail, known as the Helicostoa, was found on river limestones in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. According to Zhang Lejia, a researcher from the Museum für Naturkunde, the Helicostoa is a unique freshwater gastropod species with sessile habits and it can stick to rock surfaces like oysters. First spotted by French scientists more than 100 years ago, it was never collected again.
After comparing the newly discovered Helicostoa species with the previous specimens based on molecular systematic, morphological and anatomical studies, researchers named the new species Helicostoa liuae to distinguish it from the former Helicostoa sinensis.
The researchers found that only the adult female is sessile, resulting in an opening on the body whorl that performs the roles of the original aperture, such as eating, excretion and mating. In comparison, the male is vagile, with a normal aperture.
Zhang, who led the research team, told Xinhua that they believe the sessility of female Helicostoa was a result of the adaptive evolution of the gastropod to the environment in the rapids, and the secondary aperture and sexual dimorphism are the evolutionary innovations to conquer the challenges of survival and reproduction.
""Helicostoa is a good case for in-depth study of adaptive evolution and evolutionary innovation,"" he said, noting that the habitats of the species are close to urban areas and hydropower stations, so protection will be needed for the Helicostoa.

Commercial aerospace company CAS Space and the Chinese Academy of Sciences Microsatellite Innovation Research Institute have confirmed a plan that the low-cost cargo spacecraft product developed by the Microsatellite Innovation Institute will be launched by the company’s Kinetica 2 liquid carrier rocket and will undergo the first flight mission in 2025 for comprehensive on-orbit assessment and verification, the Global Times learned from the company on Friday.
The first flight can also carry low-orbit internet constellation satellites.
To further reduce the cost of transporting cargo to the space station and enhance the flexibility of cargo transportation, the China Manned Space Agency issued in May 2023 the call for proposals for the overall plan of the low-cost cargo transportation system for the Chinese space station.
The CAS Space and the Microsatellite Innovation Institute jointly conducted ship-rocket integration verification and key technology research. Its design of an integrated ""Ship-Rocket-Cargo"" space-to-ground transportation system utilizes a low-cost cargo spacecraft and the Long March 2 liquid carrier rocket to provide a solution.
The proposal successfully won the qualification bidding organized by the China Manned Space Agency and entered the detailed design phase.
Kinetica 2 is a medium-sized liquid carrier rocket independently developed by CAS Space. Inheriting the technology of its previous generation of rocket, Kinetica 2 adopted a CBC (Common Booster Core) configuration, with a common core diameter of 3.35 meters, a total length of 53 meters, a takeoff mass of 628 tons, and a takeoff thrust of 766 tons.
The rocket has a SSO (single sign-on) payload capacity of 7.8 tons and a LEO (low Earth orbit) payload capacity of 12 tons. It has the capability to launch satellites into sun-synchronous orbit, low Earth orbit, and transfer orbit. With its large carrying capacity and low cost, it can be the main rocket for China's low-cost cargo spacecraft, satellite internet networking, space science satellite launches, and deep space exploration missions.
The three core requirements of the cargo transportation system for the Chinese space station are high payload, high efficiency, and low cost. The research team, through the ""Ship-Rocket-Cargo"" plan to meet these requirements, focused on key technologies such as low-orbit batch production design, multi-method weight reduction and quality assurance, high-intelligence assistance in packaging, and fully digitalized design. The solution has flexible configuration, high efficiency, and cargo transportation guarantee, resulting in five features: ultra-cost effective, ultra-fast, ultra-load capacity, ultra-safe, and ultra-comfortable.
The planned Kinetica 2 launch is the first time that a Chinese commercial aerospace company participates in the development and launch of the low-cost cargo transportation project for the Chinese space station. This mission is of great significance in enhancing China's aerospace sector's innovation vitality and market competitiveness.

Chinese scientists develop ultrastrong, high thermal insulating ceramics
 (Xinhua) 11:26, January 12, 2024
GUANGZHOU, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have created a new porous ceramic that is ultrastrong at elevated temperatures and simultaneously high thermal insulating, two properties needed for making the shell of hypersonic aircraft.
The team, led by Chu Yanhui from the South China University of Technology, developed porous high-entropy diboride ceramics exhibiting remarkable load-carrying capability, high thermal insulating performance, and superior thermal stability of up to 2,000 degrees Celsius.
Such properties have made it an attractive option for reliable thermal insulation under extreme conditions, according to the university.
Searching for a porous ceramic that is both strong and resistant to extreme heat has been a holy grail for material scientists with the advent of hypersonic flight technologies. The two features, however, are difficult to achieve simultaneously in conventional porous ceramics, whose previous record of maximum temperature stood at 1,500 degrees Celsius.
Researchers said the new material has broad application prospects in the aerospace, energy, and chemical industries.
The study has been published in the journal Advanced Materials.

Guideline cleans up pollutants
By Hou Liqiang (China Daily) 10:32, January 12, 2024
Three national government bodies made public a guideline on synergizing sewage treatment and carbon emission control, vowing to build 100 exemplary low-carbon sewage treatment plants by 2025.
The country also aims to raise the utilization rate of recycled water to over 25 percent in all prefecture-level cities that suffer water scarcity by that time, according to a document issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.
The guideline details a series of measures to enhance energy efficiency and bolster greenhouse gas control in the sewage disposal sector. The country, for instance, will optimize the layout of sewage treatment plants to avoid lengthy transportation of wastewater for disposal, it said.
More underground sewage treatment plants will be built in cities with scarce land resources, it notes.
The spaces above such facilities will be used to build parks so as to improve the urban living environment and increase carbon sink capacity.
It also vows to accelerate the phasing out of sewage treatment facilities with low energy efficiency while promoting the application of energy-efficient ones.
China will also make efforts to tap the application of heat pumps in sewage treatment plants to provide air conditioning for nearby communities, it said.
A heat pump extracts heat from a source, such as geothermal energy stored in the ground or waste heat from a factory, and transfers the heat to where it is needed.
Transferring rather than generating heat is far more efficient than traditional air conditioning technologies.
According to the guideline, China will also promote the application of solar photovoltaic power generation systems in sewage plants in regions with rich solar resources, making full use of available spaces such as rooftops.
Another major concern in the document is the disposal of sludge.
Instead of turning to landfills for sludge disposal, China will make greater efforts to promote the utilization of sludge as a resource, it said.
The country will ramp up efforts to collect more methane, a heat-trapping gas much more potent than carbon dioxide, from sludge for utilization. More power generation stations fueled by the flammable gas will be built in sewage treatment plants.
Some sewage treatment plants across the country have built up such power stations to control methane emissions and generate green power.
The Beijing Drainage Group, for instance, has put such a power station go into operation in its Gaoantun sewage treatment plant in the capital in October.
Making full use of the 20 million metric tons of methane generated in sludge disposal, the station can produce 30 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, equivalent to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 18,000 tons.
The document said China will promote the consumption of reclaimed water in high water-consuming sectors, including car washes, golf courses and skiing facilities.

CHENGDU, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Workers on Thursday broke ground on what is set to be the world's highest-altitude pumped-storage power station in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
With an altitude of 4,300 meters, the facility is located in Daofu County in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Garze, according to the Yalong River Hydropower Development Company, Ltd.
Upon completion, the Daofu pumped-storage power station will feature a total designed installed capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts, generating over 2.99 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.
With an expected investment of 15.1 billion yuan (2.11 billion U.S. dollars), it is expected to be the pumped-storage power project with the largest installed capacity in Sichuan, and the world's highest-altitude mega pumped-storage power station, the company said.
Pumped-storage power stations use off-peak electricity to pump water to higher locations, where it is stored and then released to generate electricity when the power supply is strained. They can complement wind and solar power generation, which brings bigger fluctuations to the grid.
The Daofu pumped-storage station is expected to store 12.6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity daily, meeting the power consumption needs of approximately 2 million households in Sichuan.
The station will be of great significance for optimizing the power structure and boosting the complementary development of new energy sources.
At present, the highest-altitude pumped-storage power station in the world is the Yamzho Yumco Lake pumped-storage power station in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, situated at an altitude of about 3,600 meters.

In recent years, with the rapid development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and big data, autonomous driving has been increasingly applied in the transportation sector in China. From being tested in closed test fields and on designated roads, it is now being piloted and employed in commercial trial operations.
China's Ministry of Transport recently issued a trial safety guideline on the use of driverless vehicles in the public transportation sector. It marked the first time for China to state in a national policy that intelligent connected vehicles can be used for commercial transportation, and is believed to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving technology across the country.
In recent years, the autonomous driving industry in China has experienced rapid growth, along with an expanding market. Currently, there are 17 national-level autonomous driving demonstration zones and 7 national-level pilot zones for intelligent connected vehicles across the country. These zones have opened up over 22,000 kilometers of roads for testing, accumulating a total test mileage of over 70 million kilometers.
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and some other cities have introduced policies allowing autonomous vehicles to engage in commercial trial operations in specific areas and during specific time periods, including urban public transportation, taxi services, and logistics delivery. The scale of application continues to expand in these cities.
It is reported that in Shunyi district of Beijing, the autonomous delivery vehicles of Meituan, a Chinese shopping platform for locally found consumer products and retail services, are delivering thousands of orders per day.
With an Apollo Go mobile application, passengers in Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone, central China's Hubei province, can hail a fully autonomous vehicle after a few taps on their phones to set their pick-up and drop-off locations in the app.
Once a destination is confirmed, the vehicle will drive according to the predetermined route. Equipped with fisheye cameras and laser sensors, the vehicle can accurately avoid obstacles and automatically adjust its speed based on traffic conditions.

Wuhan has launched 300 unmanned vehicles since it initiated the fully driverless robotaxi service in August 2022, which serves a population of over 4 million people.
Currently, there are over 200 autonomous city buses, more than 1,500 autonomous taxis, and approximately 1,000 autonomous trucks operating nationwide. Apollo autonomous driving, developed by Chinese tech giant Baidu, has accumulated a test mileage of over 78 million kilometers, providing transportation services in over 10 cities.
Continuously enhancing safety capabilities is the primary goal of transportation services and a fundamental requirement for the widespread application of autonomous vehicles in the transportation sector. The concept of safety is consistently emphasized in the measures proposed by the guideline.
Overall, the guideline has established a safety assurance system from six aspects: safety production system, transportation safety protection, operational status information management, vehicle dynamic monitoring, safety notification, and emergency response. This provides regulatory compliance for autonomous vehicles to engage in road transportation operations safely.
The guideline specifically proposed the concept of ""security inspector"" - the person responsible for overseeing the safe operation of an autonomous vehicle in-cabin or remotely.
Li Bin, deputy director of the Research Institute of Highway under China's Ministry of Transport, noted that the guideline fully considers the commercial models of autonomous driving in different forms. While ensuring safety, the guideline sets regulations on the allocation of safety personnel, skills, and qualifications for different transportation operations.
According to the guideline, the safe operation of fully autonomous taxis can be ensured by remote security inspectors. The guideline said that with the approval of local governments, fully autonomous taxis could be operated over designated areas with one security inspector overseeing them remotely, and the ratio of remote security inspectors to taxis shall not be lower than 1:3.

The guideline specifies the application scenarios for autonomous driving vehicles to provide road transportation services.
For autonomous city buses, relevant passenger transport operations can be carried out in physically enclosed, relatively enclosed, or fixed routes with simple traffic conditions where traffic safety is controllable.
Autonomous taxis are allowed to carry out passenger transport operations in scenarios with good traffic conditions and controllable traffic safety.
Besides, autonomous vehicles are prohibited from engaging in road transportation operations for dangerous goods.
The guideline also clarifies the responsibilities for the providers of autonomous transport services. For instance, the operators of autonomous taxis and other passenger vehicles should purchase carrier's liability insurance according to laws.
""The increasingly improved environment for industrial development provides possibilities for the accelerated application of autonomous vehicles in the transportation service sector,"" said Wang Xianjin, vice-president of the China Academy of Transportation Sciences, which is a part of the Ministry of Transport.
The release of the guideline has laid a solid foundation for the safe application of autonomous driving vehicles and also leaves ample room for innovative applications, Wang said, adding that this will further promote the application of autonomous driving technology in the transportation sector.

China's Martian probe found clues about the geological and climate changes that the planet underwent about 400,000 years ago. The findings suggested that the southern Utopian Plain of the red planet probably experienced a change in climate marked by a wind direction change, coinciding with the end of the Mars ice age.
Also, the country's FAST telescope identified key evidence for the existence of nanohertz gravitational waves, which can help solve puzzles in supermassive black holes, the history of galaxy mergers, and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.
Using the world's largest single-dish and most sensitive radio telescope, the scientists monitored 57-millisecond pulsars with regular cadence for 41 months and discovered quadrupole correlation signatures compatible with the prediction of nanohertz gravitational waves at a 4.6-sigma statistical confidence level.
To utilize more clean energy, China has made a milestone advance in its effort to build a solar power station in space to convert the sunlight in outer space into an electrical supply to drive the satellites in orbit or transmit power back to the Earth.
A Chinese research team has wrapped up the world's first full-chain, system-wide ground verification for space solar power stations, displaying multiple key know-how for the futuristic project known as Zhuri or chasing the sun.
China's home-grown nuclear power facilities also stole the limelight. The world's first fourth-generation nuclear power plant, China's Shidaowan high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) nuclear power plant, has officially gone into commercial operation.
The reactor can maintain a safe state and steer away from a meltdown or leak of radioactive materials. This capability is maintained even in the event of a complete loss of cooling capacity, without any intervention actions.
In the field of agriculture, a team in China found a key gene in a crop that might, via genetic engineering, substantially improve crop yields in alkaline soil.
The breakthrough in agriculture could increase the production of crops, including rice and maize, by at least 250 million tonnes should the newly identified gene be applied to 20 percent of global under-utilized saline and alkaline soil.
The construction of an 11,100-meter deep well for geological research, the world's fastest two-dimensional transistors with the lowest energy consumption, the first discovery of superconductivity near 80K in a nickelate, and the structural basis of mammal's odorant perception are also included in the country's scientific advances last year.
In the global landscape of breakthroughs, the launch of GPT-4 and AI-generated proteins highlighted the tech trend of artificial intelligence.
The mapping of insects' brains and cell types across the adult human brain, the world's first eye transplant surgery, and a draft human pangenome reference were selected into the world's advances in the field of biology.
The operation of the world's largest experimental nuclear fusion reactor, the smallest particle accelerator, the single-atom X-ray detection, and the energy supply to Earth from satellite ranked among the global top 10 in 2023.
This year's list is the 30th annual event of its kind. The event has gained widespread media attention at home and abroad and helps to promote the understanding of science and technology among the public.

Chinese scientists design swimming robot to detect contaminants, pathogens
 (Xinhua) 16:13, January 11, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a tiny, battery-free and wireless soft swimming robot that can detect contaminants and pathogens in confined spaces.
The study published on Thursday in the journal Science Advances describes the miniaturized mobile electronic system powered with external radio frequency signals.
The arrow-shaped device can sense temperature, and detect and quantify chloride, ammonium and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in water passing through narrow pipes that are difficult to reach.
Simultaneously, the in-situ measurements can be transmitted, via near-field communication, to a nearby smartphone for readouts, according to the study.
The researchers from City University of Hong Kong, Dalian University of Technology and Beihang University attached magnets and coils to flexible tails that oscillate when an antenna receives electromagnetic frequencies, allowing the device to flap up and down to propel itself forward, like a dolphin.
The team also incorporated specific electrodes to detect chloride and ammonium ions in water with a high degree of accuracy and added an antibody-modified graphene layer onto another electrode to capture SARS-CoV-2 virus particles.
""This wireless smart system demonstrates broad potential for confined-space exploration, ranging from pathogen detection to pollution investigation,"" said Yu Xinge from City University of Hong Kong, the correspondence author of the paper.

Chinese scientists propose new method for highly efficient tumor therapy,2024-01-11,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0111/c90000-20120747.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists propose new method for highly efficient tumor therapy
 (Xinhua) 15:01, January 11, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have introduced a metal-free nanozyme based on graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient tumor therapy.
The study, conducted by a research group led by the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published Thursday in the journal Matter.
According to the study, GQDs presents a promising and cost-effective means in tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, the limited catalytic activity of GQDs has posed great challenges for their clinical application, particularly under the challenging catalytic conditions.
To enhance the catalytic performance of the GQD-based nanocatalytic adjuvant, the researchers designed GQDs using a diatomic doping strategy.
According to the study, the GQDs have been shown to possess impressive peroxidase-mimicking activity. As a result, the GQDs are highly effective at inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis of cancer cells in vitro. They also selectively target tumors, with a tumor inhibition rate as high as 77.71 percent for intravenous injection and 93.22 percent for intratumoral injection, with no off-target side effects.
""The obtained GQDs, which are made from red blood cell membranes, are highly effective in treating tumors with few side effects,"" said Liu Hongji, a member of the research team.
""One of the advantages is that they are metal-free. In addition, they function as excellent peroxidase-like biocatalysts,"" Liu added.
This drug-free, target-specific, and biologically benign nanozyme has great potential as a potent biocatalyst for use in safe cancer treatment, according to the study.

China's Yunnan brews pour-over coffee using novel technologies
 (Xinhua) 13:45, January 11, 2024
KUNMING, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- An AI-powered robot was showing off its coffee brewing skills, while intelligent roasters were roasting various flavors of coffee beans and waterless husking machinery automatically separating green and red coffee fruits, at a recent coffee expo held in China's Yunnan.
More than 200 technology companies from across the globe were represented at the three-day China (Pu'er) International Coffee Expo which opened on Jan. 5 in Pu'er, southwest China's Yunnan Province. These companies showcased their new coffee products and production equipment.
Among them, the 5G cloud intelligent robot designed by China Mobile served freshly brewed coffee to visitors -- an idea novel enough to hog the limelight.
The robot adopts 5G Internet of Things for its data transmission and can automatically complete the coffee production process from bean extraction, grinding, brewing, and cleaning. Within minutes, the futuristic barista finished making a cup of fragrant coffee.
With the help of AI technologies, the robot has commanded the necessary brewing techniques from the Coffee Masters champions. It now can perfectly reproduce the coffee made by the masters. ""Every cup of coffee made by this robot can be of the same quality,"" said a staff member of China Mobile at the expo.
As one of China's major coffee production areas, in 2022 alone, Yunnan had a total coffee cultivation area of about 1.27 million mu (about 84,600 hectares) and its annual output of raw coffee beans exceeded 114,000 tonnes, making a comprehensive output value of more than 41.8 billion yuan (about 5.88 billion U.S. dollars).
Yunnan is now tapping into novel science and technology breakthroughs to turbocharge the development of its rising coffee industry. The introduction of advanced coffee production and processing machinery has helped greatly in improving the local coffee quality.
Li Yulei, sales director of a local coffee production machinery and equipment company in Pu'er, brought a waterless coffee bean husking machine, independently designed by his company to this year's expo.
With the latest technologies, the equipment can separate red coffee fruit from the green automatically, which helps improve efficiency in producing more high-quality coffee beans.
In a coffee manor in Pu'er, Liao Xiugui, who has more than 20 years experience of planting coffee, has recently begun to lead local farmers to develop high-quality coffee with the aim of transforming their approach from merely ""growing coffee"" to ""growing good coffee.""
In addition to promoting ecological planting, Liao also purchased a large number of advanced roasting and processing equipment. The coffee fruits grown in the manor are turned into high-quality coffee beans in the workshop thanks to the new machinery.
""We have seen the progress of Chinese coffee, especially Yunnan coffee, and hope to make more exchanges in the future,"" said a Mexican coffee exhibitor after tasting the coffee made by the AI-powered robot barista.
