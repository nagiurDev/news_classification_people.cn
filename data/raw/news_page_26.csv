China says U.S. should remove self-imposed obstacles to lunar research cooperation
 (Xinhua) 09:28, June 28, 2024
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China's space agency on Thursday said the United States needs to remove its self-imposed barriers that have hindered collaborative efforts of the two countries' scientists in the space sector.
At a press conference in Beijing, Bian Zhigang, deputy head of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), responded to an inquiry about the possibility of American scientists investigating the samples retrieved by the Chang'e-6 mission from the far side of the moon.
""China has always been open to exchanges and cooperation with the United States in the field of space,"" said Bian. ""However, the current challenges primarily stemmed from U.S. domestic legislation such as the Wolf Amendment.""
In 2011, the U.S. Congress passed a law known as the Wolf Amendment, prohibiting U.S. government agencies, including NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, from cooperating with China on space activities.
China welcomes researchers from all countries to submit applications according to the CNSA procedures, according to Bian.
""American scientists do hold the prospect of investigating the samples collected in the Chang'e-6 lunar mission. If the U.S. side sincerely hopes to promote cooperation between the two countries, it must take practical measures to remove these obstacles,"" he said.
Noting that China's remarkable achievements in space are a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of its own people, Bian said that the Wolf Amendment had failed to deter China's progress but inadvertently created a stumbling block for the United States itself.
Scientists have published more than 1,900 papers using data from China's lunar exploration missions, according to Bian.
China encourages Chinese and foreign scientists to collaborate on scientific research involving lunar samples and data, striving for more original and groundbreaking results, he said.
Nevertheless, the official cited some examples of the two country's collaborative efforts, such as the establishment of an intergovernmental dialogue mechanism for civil space cooperation.
Also, in response to U.S. requests, the CNSA has initiated an exchange mechanism for Mars probe orbital data, a framework designed to evaluate potential collision risks for all Mars probes in orbit, he added.

China sets to expand int'l cooperation in lunar exploration missions
 (Xinhua) 08:06, June 28, 2024
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China is set to expand its international collaborations in upcoming lunar exploration endeavors following the successful operation of payloads from the European Space Agency (ESA), France, Italy, and Pakistan in China's Chang'e-6 mission.
The country's Chang'e-7 lunar exploration mission will carry six international scientific instruments, and Chang'e-8 will offer 200 kilograms of international payload capacity and has garnered over 30 applications, said Liu Yunfeng, deputy director of the China National Space Administration's (CNSA) international cooperation department.
The Chang'e-7 mission, scheduled for launch around 2026, is poised to survey the lunar south pole region. The Chang'e-8 probe will be launched around 2028 to carry out experiments on lunar resource utilization and, along with Chang'e-7, constitute the basic model of an international lunar research station by 2035.
The CNSA has signed cooperation documents with more than ten countries and international organizations on the International Lunar Research Station project, said Liu at a press conference on Thursday.
In the Chang'e-6 mission, China has fulfilled its commitment to allocate 10 kilograms of payload capacity on the lander and another 10 kilograms on the orbiter for international cooperation, said Hu Hao, chief designer of the Chang'e-6 mission, at the conference.
According to Liu, the international collaborative tasks in the mission have been going well. The French payload DORN worked for 32 hours, and ESA payload NILS worked for 3 hours and 50 minutes on the moon's surface.
Liu also said that the Italian laser retroreflector installed on top of the lander operated normally.
China delivered data provided by a CubeSat aboard its Chang'e-6 spacecraft to Pakistan on May 10. The cube satellite, ICUBE-Q, was developed by Pakistan's Institute of Space Technology and China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
""Despite differences in language, work culture, and developmental protocols, we have worked hand in hand to conduct an extensive array of tests over the past year and more and completed the task successfully,"" said Hu.
""The invaluable experience can enrich our expertise and prepare us to tackle even more sophisticated tasks in the future,"" Hu added.

Chengdu speeds up development of low-altitude economy,2024-06-27,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0627/c90000-20186415.html,"Home>>
		
Chengdu speeds up development of low-altitude economy
By Wang Mingfeng (People's Daily) 14:12, June 27, 2024
A tourist surnamed Yao visiting the Danjing Mountain in Pengzhou, Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan province just experienced the convenience of drone delivery - soon after he stepped into the scenic area, a drone delivered to his hands a cup of hot coffee he had previously ordered on his phone.
Chengdu is among the first batch of pilot cities of China's low-altitude airspace management reform. Striving to build itself into a center of low-altitude economy in west China, the city is strengthening its exploration in development and manufacturing, low-altitude airspace development, scenario innovation, and integrated development.

This year, the city aims to improve the output of its low-altitude manufacturing sector to 6.5 billion yuan ($895.63 million) and expand the size of its low-altitude economy to 26 billion yuan.
""We handled over 500 food delivery orders during the Spring Festival, and we flew more than 100 flights per day when visitors came to enjoy the flower blossoms, which made us internet-famous. The popularity is totally beyond our imagination,"" said Zhou Xiaoming, chairman of a drone tech firm based in Chengdu, the operator of a national-level flight-testing center for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) known as ""Sky Eye.""
According to him, currently the company runs six routes deep in the valleys along the Jianjiang River in Longmen Mountains, Sichuan province, which can not only deliver coffees, but also “paradrop” hotpot food and groceries based on users' demands.
It takes only about 20 minutes for the drones to deliver stuffs from merchants to scenic areas, B&B hotels and camp sites, Zhou added.
Apart from daily life scenarios, drones are also widely applied in industries such as emergency rescue and meteorological observation in Chengdu.
For example, the long-range and multipurpose Wing Loong drones have become a strong force in China's meteorological and emergency support systems, assisting artificial precipitation, monitoring meteorological phenomenon in the sky and ensuring stable cloud communication.
An executive of AVIC (Chengdu) UAS Co., Ltd. noted that the company will continue to innovate in low-altitude application scenarios and actively explore the new field of logistics transportation.
It is reported that Chengdu has now built a complete industrial chain covering raw materials, basic components and systems, complete drone manufacturing, and operational services.
It has gathered more than 110 upstream and downstream enterprises, with products ranging from 10 kilograms to tonnage level, covering 66 application scenarios such as urban governance and production operations.
Statistics show that in recent years, the industrial output of Chengdu's UAV industry has maintained an average annual growth of over 20 percent. Last year, the total revenue of Chengdu's UAV industrial exceeded 10 billion yuan, ranking among the top in China in terms of overall competitiveness.
Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft are also a focus of low-altitude economy. Nicknamed ""flying cars,"" these aircraft are considered one of the most important carriers for the development of low-altitude economy.
As one of the first pilot cities of China's low-altitude airspace management reform, Chengdu has relaxed policies in the low-altitude sector, which has boosted the confidence of companies in launching their products.

In July last year, AEROFUGIA, a tech firm in low altitude transportation and smart industry solutions owned by Chinese car manufacturer Geely, signed an agreement with Sino Jet, the largest business jet operator in Asia-Pacific, for the acquisition of 100 Chinese-made eVTOL aircraft.
The two will work together to promote the application of eVTOL in business aviation. Once the airworthiness certification is completed, Chengdu is expected to be the first city to apply eVTOL in business air travel.
Orderly and compliant opening of the low-altitude airspace is a prerequisite for low-altitude economy to ""take off.""
Every day, industrial drone enterprises would carry out various scientific and research tasks such as signal transmission and river channel inspection in the airspace of the ""Sky Eye"" UAV flight test base, which is below an altitude of 1,200 meters and covers a radius of 5 kilometers.
Zheng Wenqiang, director of a flight base of JOUAV, a Chengdu-based drone company, told People's Daily that over the past five years, he and his team have completed nearly 10,000 test flights of drones in the base.
""Stable time and range, as well as unique terrain and landforms, are necessary conditions for conducting test flights of industrial-grade drones,"" Zheng said.
""Sky Eye"" covers diverse landforms such as mountains, hills, forests, rivers, and lakes, which can simulate the working conditions of industrial drones in actual application scenarios to the greatest extent, he explained.
Zhou said, ""In the national-level flight-testing center for UAVs, you just need to provide notification one hour before takeoff, which greatly improves flight efficiency and helps achieve maximum flight capability.""
It is learned that Sichuan province has designated seven airspaces for coordinated management and eight low-altitude visual flight corridors. Nearly 1/3 of Chengdu's territory is within the scope of the Sichuan low-altitude reform pilot airspace, which is public and open for regular flights.
Up to now, Chengdu's UAVs have completed over 8 million flights, accumulating 600,000 hours of flight time. The efficiency of airspace resource utilization has been significantly improved in the city.

Share new energy, say speakers
By Cheng Yu and Zhang Xiaomin (China Daily) 10:55, June 27, 2024

John Quelch, executive vice-chancellor of Duke Kunshan University, speaks at a forum on the development of new energy vehicles during the Summer Davos Forum in Dalian on Wednesday. (ZOU HONG/CHINA DAILY)
New energy development should be shared and the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment should be renegotiated for mutual benefit, said prominent industry experts and former top government officials at the ongoing 15th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as the Summer Davos Forum.
Their remarks come at a time when China, the world's second-largest economy, has been subjected to protectionist policies by its major trade partners, including the United States and the European Union, in the new energy sector.
Zeng Yuqun, founder of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker, said countries can benefit from new energy by sharing the industry chain.
He proposed what he called a sharing model. Companies can expand their production capacity intelligently, by installing it across the world — for example, 30 percent in Africa that boasts resources, 40 percent in China that has the most intense technology and investment efficiency, and the rest in the US or Europe, which have big markets.
""Through such a sharing model, all countries and regions would benefit and the geopolitical tensions like the tariffs would be left behind… Because, climate change and sustainability are so important for each one of them,"" he said.
Zeng said CATL has already taken some measures to diversify its overseas market share and is willing to share its technology with every country in the world, including those in the EU, South Korea, and the US.
The European Commission said earlier this month it would impose additional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from next month.
As the EU and China have agreed to negotiate, Wan Gang, former minister of science and technology, suggested that the EU should also consider renegotiating the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with China, instead of going ahead with the proposed higher tariffs.
The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was reached in December 2020 to facilitate trade and investment between European and Chinese companies. Under the agreement, EU firms can get better access to emerging sectors like new energy in China. However, the European Parliament voted to freeze the agreement's ratification in May 2021.
""It is necessary for the two sides to negotiate properly to move forward together toward economic globalization. Renegotiating the CAI could be an opportunity,"" said Wan, who is also the president of the China Association for Science and Technology.
The Chinese authorities said at the Summer Davos Forum on Tuesday that given the current bleak global economic growth scenario, countries that prioritize maximizing their own interests without considering the interests of others, or even backtrack by promoting decoupling and erecting barriers, will drag the world into a vicious cycle of competing for a diminishing pie.
Wan said there is a ""common consensus"" all over the world on developing NEVs, and such a trend is unstoppable. ""China will not slow down the development of NEVs just because of some twists and turns. China's auto market is already highly globalized.""
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China exported 1.2 million NEVs in 2023, up nearly 78 percent.
Among such NEVs, around 30 percent are from Tesla's Shanghai factory, Wan noted, adding that a large number of the cars produced last year were from joint ventures of Chinese and foreign companies.

Intellectual property right protection crucial to healthy AI development,2024-06-27,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0627/c90000-20186222.html,"Home>>
		
Intellectual property right protection crucial to healthy AI development
By Gong Wenjing (People's Daily) 09:31, June 27, 2024
Artificial intelligence (AI) creation differs greatly from traditional models of creation. It involves ""feeding"" massive amounts of data for AI training and ""referencing"" existing works. These ""feedings"" and ""references"" raise concerns about potential copyright infringement, sparking extensive discussions in relevant industries.
In April this year, the Beijing Internet Court ruled on China's first AI voice rights case. The plaintiff was a voice-over artist surnamed Yin who found out in May 2023 that her voice was being used in numerous audiobooks online without her consent.

An artificial intelligence-generated painting is exhibited at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) held in Shanghai, east China. (People's Daily Online/Xu Kunde)
After the investigation, it was found that one cultural media company, with whom Yin had previous business dealings, handed over the audio recordings of Yin's audiobooks to another software company which then processed her voice using AI technology and sold it to the operator of the app ""Magic Sound Workshop.""
The court decided that the defendants - the cultural media company and the software company - are jointly responsible for compensating Yin for economic losses of 250,000 yuan ($34,433). The app operator and the software company are also required to issue an apology to the plaintiff within seven days of the judgment taking effect.
Copyright infringement risks are present in every stage of AI creation. During the development phase, there are issues around authorizing training data copyrights. In the utilization phase, there are questions about determining the nature of generated content and attributing copyrights.
Furthermore, because AI-generated content follows the creative patterns of its training works, there may be infringement concerns arising from style imitation, such as paintings in the style of Van Gogh or AI-generated songs imitating famous singers, which has sparked discussions about the legitimacy of style imitation.
In November 2023, the Beijing Internet Court concluded a widely followed copyright infringement case involving AI text-to-image generation between plaintiff surnamed Li and defendant surnamed Liu. The court made a groundbreaking ruling that AI-generated images with a natural person's independent intellectual input should be recognized as copyright-protected works.
""The AI generative cases that the court has been handling typically involve copyrights, personality rights, data rights, and other new types of legal issues, many of which are the first of their kind in China,"" said Yan Jun, a senior judge of the Beijing Internet Court.
The question of whether AI-generated content is eligible for copyright protection is a contentious topic that needs to be addressed promptly given the rising intellectual property (IP) challenges, said Yan.
Is copyright protection valid for all AI-generated content?
""The personalized features in AI-generated content, the degree of creator involvement, and choices made on creative elements vary from case to case, making it impossible to make generalizations,"" said Zhang Ping, a professor with Peking University Law School.
The generated content can only be protected by copyright law if it meets the criteria of originality and copyrightability, Zhang added.

Take the above AI text-to-image copyright infringement case as an example. The plaintiff created the images in question using generative AI technology, showcasing the intellectual input in decisions such as character presentation, prompt order, and parameter settings.
""The plaintiff made a series of aesthetic choices and personalized judgments in creating the images, exhibiting outstanding individualized expression that met the 'originality' criteria. Therefore, the plaintiff holds the copyright to the images,"" said Bai Niannian, a senior partner at Gongheng Law Firm based in Beijing.
Content auto-generated by AI without human originality should not be considered a work nor be eligible for copyright protection, Bai added.
Zhang believes that the current copyright system uses human intellectual achievements as the benchmark, thus lacking comprehensive provisions for AI-generated content. Meanwhile, traditional infringement determination standards also face applicability challenges in AI creation scenarios, presenting new obstacles for judicial practices.
The legal framework for AI-generated content is closely linked to the core interests of copyright holders and has a direct impact on industrial development and technological progress. Finding a proper balance between protection and development tests the governance wisdom of all parties involved.
Zhang said that in general, China's generative AI technology innovation is progressing rapidly, so the formulation of laws and regulations should leave room for technological innovation and adopt an open and inclusive regulatory principle.
On how to accommodate the interests of all parties and fully unleash the vitality of AI creation, Zhang said that first of all, it is important to improve laws and regulations to clarify the scope and standards for copyright protection of AI-generated content and strengthen normative management of the data training process.
Besides, establishing a liability-sharing mechanism adapted to the development of the AI industry is vital, she noted.
Zhang also suggested creating open data-sharing platforms to encourage reasonable use and licensing of data, promoting industry self-discipline and multi-party collaboration to foster healthy development of AI creation.
""The rise of AI creation inevitably challenges traditional IP rules, but this challenge is not insurmountable. The key is to clarify the norms of intellectual property right protection in each stage of the AI creation process and establish interest balancing and sharing mechanisms among relevant parties to protect and drive the development of AI creation,"" said Zhang.

NY-ALESUND, Norway, June 26 (Xinhua) -- In late June, amid Norway's Svalbard archipelago, marking the onset of summer in the Arctic islands, Chinese scientists at a pioneering research outpost delve into uncharted territories while fostering deep friendships with colleagues worldwide, blending scientific exploration with the warmth of human camaraderie.
ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND RESEARCH NEXUS
""You came at a very good time, as tomorrow is the annual litter cleaning campaign,"" Chinese scientist Hu Zhengyi tells this summer's new research fellows at one of the planet's northernmost permanent residences, a town named Ny-Alesund at a latitude of 79 degrees North.
The researchers traveled over the glaciers to the town in a twin-turboprop aircraft.
""The day after tomorrow is our midsummer party,"" Hu tells them, excited about inviting newcomers to the town's upcoming events.
Originally a coal mining settlement, scientific research has been the main activity in Ny-Alesund since the 1960s. The town is currently home to scientists from over 10 countries, including members of China's Arctic Yellow River Station, located on the far east side of the settlement.
Around 40 people live in the community all year round, although more researchers come in the summertime, which can bring the population to up to 180.
Hu, who is the manager of the Chinese station, participates in all aspects of town life, from the Norwegian Constitution Day parade to litter-cleaning campaigns and summer barbecue parties. Sometimes he will drink a beer while chatting with old or new friends, although he says he is ""a lightweight when it comes to drinking.""
Established in 2004, the Yellow River Station is China's first Arctic scientific research station. The facility provides support for scientific monitoring and research in glaciology, terrestrial ecology, marine ecology, space physics, and atmospheric studies.
Earl Sullivan Lester, senior engineer with the Norwegian Mapping Authority, shared with Xinhua how he got to know the head of the Chinese station over chili sauce.
""Back home we call it 'Happy Chef,'"" Lester explained, referring to a Chinese chili sauce which Chinese researchers always bring to the cafeteria as a necessity for daily meals.
Before coming to Svalbard, Lester was not aware of the existence of a Chinese research station here. Now he calls it ""a really special part of this community.""
When a jar of chili sauce becomes the catalyst for a connection between two people, it exemplifies the typical way many friendships are formed in this town.
""The direct, human, one-on-one conversations you can have here really accelerate or amplify the possibilities for collaboration,"" Lester said.
ENVIRONMENTAL CRUSADE IN SVALBARD
In Svalbard, Chinese and Norwegian scientists have been conducting a collaborative project on how microplastics affect polar environments.
""Industry is producing chemicals all the time,"" said Geir Wing Gabrielsen, section leader in Toxicology at the Norwegian Polar Institute, who has worked in Svalbard for over 40 years.
""There are probably 200,000 chemicals on the market and we only have good knowledge of 10 percent of them,"" he said.
It is estimated that over 150 million tons of plastics have accumulated in the world's oceans since the onset of industrial production in the 1950s, according to a study by the Arctic Council's working group Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment in 2019.
Plastic items break down into microplastics, which keep on accumulating in the environment, eventually finding their way into every part of the food chain.
Since 2017, Chinese and Norwegian scientists have been cooperating to collect samples from the air and ocean around Svalbard, attempting to identify unknown chemicals. Samples are sent to Shanghai's Tongji University for analysis.
""It is very important to have good laboratories for doing such analytical work,"" Gabrielsen said.
Gabrielsen noted that Tongji University's ""fantastic lab"" has been used to identify new chemicals as well as to follow their development patterns, thus providing input into an ""important international process.""
To solve a global issue, it takes an attitude of openness and active data sharing, Lu said. ""Based on our sincere and open-minded cooperation, this project has been stable and successful.""
POLAR LEGACY AND CULTURAL CROSSROADS
On the roof of the Yellow River Station, there is a sampling device to capture microplastics from the air, working tirelessly under the midnight sun.
One hundred meters to the west is a monument to famous Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who chose Ny-Alesund as a starting point for his expeditions to the North Pole a century ago.
To the east, the mooring mast for Amundsen's airship ""Norge"" still stands on the tundra.
The work of Amundsen and his contemporaries marked a turning point for polar exploration, when it moved from a search for personal glory through conquering extremes and breaking records, to a focus on systematic scientific inquiry.
Meanwhile, the allure of Ny-Alesund for contemporary tourists lies in the juxtaposition of century-old expedition relics and ongoing scientific endeavors.
Today, when cruise tourists drop by for a few hours in the town, many of them stop in front of the Yellow River Station to take pictures of an ornament of two guardian lions. The ornament is a symbol of Ny-Alesund, said Solveig Roti Dahl, an adviser with the town's management company Kings Bay.
On June 21, Kings Bay organized the traditional summer litter clean-up in the town.
Hu was assigned to group six, tasked with cleaning the port area. His haul included rusty nails from the bygone coal mining era.
""We are guests in Norway,"" said Hu. ""It's just good manners to show our full support and enthusiasm whenever an activity is hosted in town.""
Hu has also often invited his new friends to visit the Chinese station. ""After all, we believe in building relationships, whether personally or professionally.""

Chinese scientists anticipate Chang'e-6 samples to unravel mysteries of Moon,2024-06-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0626/c90000-20186053.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists anticipate Chang'e-6 samples to unravel mysteries of Moon
 (Xinhua) 16:50, June 26, 2024
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- After the Chang'e-6 mission brought home the world's first samples collected from the moon's far side on Tuesday, Chinese scientists eagerly look forward to conducting research on the samples to uncover more mysteries of the moon.
""The Chang'e-6 mission represents a significant milestone in the history of human lunar exploration, and it will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of lunar evolution,"" said Yang Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
""New samples will inevitably lead to new discoveries. Fascination with the moon is rooted in Chinese culture down the ages. Chinese scientists are eagerly anticipating the opportunity to contribute to lunar science,"" Yang added.
Lunar samples brought by the earlier Chang'e-5 mission have already drawn applications for access from international scholars, with the process well underway. The Chang'e-6 lunar probe carried four international payloads that were developed jointly by Chinese and foreign scientists. It is conceivable that the openness of Chinese lunar exploration activities will be mirrored in the study of Chang'e-6 lunar samples, Yang said.
As the moon's revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle, the same side always faces Earth. The other face, most of which cannot be seen from Earth, is called the far side or ""dark side"" of the moon. This term doesn't refer to visible darkness, but rather the mystery shrouding the moon's largely unexplored terrain.
Remote-sensing images show the moon's two sides are very different, including lunar crust thickness, magma activities and compositions.
The reason why the near side and the far side of the moon are so different remains one of the greatest mysteries of the moon, said Lin Yangting, another scientist from the CAS Institute of Geology and Geophysics.
""Through the analysis and research of the Chang'e-6 samples, we could have a comprehensive understanding of the moon, filling many gaps in our knowledge and addressing significant scientific questions,"" Lin said.
The Chang'e-6 probe landed and collected samples in an impact crater known as the Apollo Basin, located within the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin on the far side of the moon.
The colossal SPA Basin was formed by a celestial impact over 4.3 billion years ago and has a diameter of 2,500 km, equivalent to the distance from Beijing to Hainan, and a depth of about 13 km. It is believed to be the largest impact crater found in the inner solar system so far.
Compared to Chang'e-5, the landing and sampling site of Chang'e-6 has a complex geological structure, and the samples collected are likely to be mixtures, including in-situ basalt as well as materials ejected from surrounding areas due to the impact of small celestial bodies, Lin said.
""China's Chang'e-5 mission in 2020 initiated a new phase of in-depth studies on lunar samples after a 44-year hiatus, advancing our understanding of the moon's evolution,"" said Li Xianhua, an academician of the CAS.
However, prior to the Chang'e-6 mission, all ten lunar sampling missions in human history, including the Chang'e-5 mission, took place on the near side of the moon.
""Our current knowledge of the moon primarily comes from research on samples collected from its near side, which does not represent a comprehensive scientific understanding of the whole moon,"" Li said.
For the first time in human history, samples were retrieved from the far side of the moon. The international scientific community has shown unprecedented interest in the samples returned by the Chang'e-6 mission, Li said.
The Chang'e-6 samples will be of great significance in studying the two-faced moon, which is crucial for understanding this celestial body, according to Li.
""We have never conducted a detailed study of the SPA Basin before. The exact time of the impact that formed the SPA Basin and the consequences of the impact are subject to investigation. Scientists have numerous theoretical speculations, but need analysis of the samples to test these hypotheses,"" Li said.
The impact was so huge that materials from the lunar lower crust or even upper mantle deep beneath the surface might have been brought up, which were usually difficult to obtain. ""The Chang'e-6 samples are of great significance for our understanding of the formation and early evolution of the moon,"" Li noted.
In addition, the landing site of the Chang'e-6 mission was on a basalt formed by volcanic activity. Volcanic activities on the far side of the moon were relatively rare compared with the near side, and it would be intriguing to study and compare the volcanic activities on both sides of the moon, Li said.
""We have long anticipated the samples from the far side of the moon. Since the beginning of this year, our institute has organized a team for the research on the Chang'e-6 samples. We held seminars every week to discuss the related scientific questions and plan our research in advance,"" Li added.
""We recently also invited experts from other institutions who specialize in lunar studies to join us for discussions. The venue, which can accommodate 200 people, was packed, with many enthusiastic participants standing,"" Li said.
Scientists have selected scientific problems they deemed most important, such as the origin of lunar asymmetry, the composition of the lunar deep crust or mantle, the formation time of the SPA Basin and the Apollo Basin, the volcanic history of the lunar far side, the water content, and discovery of new minerals or rocks on the moon.

BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a high-density, 1,024-channel neural probe, achieving a full-depth recording of neuronal activities in the brain of a macaque monkey for the first time in the world.
The research team led by Duan Xiaojie at Peking University designed and produced the probe named Neuroscroll, which isolates single neuronal activities simultaneously from 1,024 densely spaced channels flexibly distributed across the probe.
The probe length is tunable from 1 cm to 10 cm, covering the brain sizes ranging from those of rodent species to primates.
The team used the probes to achieve simultaneous monitoring of the activities of over 700 single neurons covering the entire depth of the macaque monkey brain. In addition, they have realized stable neural recording in the rat brain for up to two years, demonstrating the excellent biocompatibility and long-term recording stability of the probe, said Duan.
The achievement was published online on Monday in the journal Nature Neuroscience.
Cheng Heping, director of the National Biomedical Imaging Center at Peking University, said that the breakthrough provides a powerful tool for simultaneously monitoring neuronal activities across multiple brain regions and exploring the relationship between neural activities and behavioral studies.
By implanting multiple probes, it will be possible to further achieve neural recordings from up to tens of thousands of channels, which will bring transformative impacts to basic neuroscience and translational neuroscience research, such as brain-machine interfaces, said Cheng.
