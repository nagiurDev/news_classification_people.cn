Feature: AI system developed by students helps missing children return home,2023-12-07,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1207/c90000-20107148.html,"Home>>
		
Feature: AI system developed by students helps missing children return home
 (Xinhua) 10:13, December 07, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been applied in many fields, and it is now playing an increasingly important role in issues of public interest.
A group of students at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in central China's Hubei Province has developed an AI system that restores old photographs to help families find their loved ones, who had gone missing 10 to 20 years ago.
For the last three years, the volunteer team of students from HUST has been providing technological support to many desperate parents looking for their children by restoring over 1,000 photos, and it has reunited 11 missing children with their families.
The team's AI technology has increased the odds of finding missing children, reduced search times and brought hope to many families, said Zhang Baoyan, founder of baobeihuijia.com, a major non-profit organization that searches for people who have lost contact with their families.
The team was founded by Sheng Jianzhong three years ago, when he was a doctoral student at HUST's School of Software Engineering.
He first thought to restore photographs of missing children when he came across a missing child notice with a poor-quality image in 2020. As he was majoring in digital image processing, he decided to use his skills to help the parents restore their images.
But the development of an image restoration algorithm requires the construction of a large database, which cannot be completed by one person alone. Many like-minded students soon volunteered to join Sheng's project, writing code and testing algorithms.
After six months of intensive technological research and development, they produced an image restoration AI algorithm that solved the issue of unclear faces in photographs.
A restored image can be generated just minutes after a blurry portrait is entered into the system, significantly improving resolution and the clarity of facial features. Parents are then able to print the high-quality images of their missing children onto T-shirts or large posters.
In December 2021, father Sun Haiyang was finally reunited with his abducted son after 14 years of searching. The case had become a media sensation after a movie based on the story was released in 2014. Sheng's team contributed to efforts to find the boy, and Sun expressed his gratitude to them when they met.
The team maintains close relations with public security organs and non-profit organizations. In many cases, they don't have direct contact with the families, and sometimes they don't even know about their involvement. ""But we still feel fulfilled, and we are happy for them,"" said Zhang Shaoyun, a member of the team.
The volunteers have also made tapes and postcards using the restored photos to expand the scale of searches.
""We have created a small community where families can share information, send messages and comfort each other,"" Sheng said.
He has also been exploring AI application in other areas. Ahead of the 2021 Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb-sweeping Day, China's Ministry of Veterans Affairs launched a program searching for relatives of unidentified martyrs. It published information about 100 such martyrs, providing photographs of 68. Sheng's team worked against the clock for three days to release the restored images before the festival.
In the future, Sheng plans to build a more professional team to run the existing non-profit programs. ""It would use technology to help people who have lost their loved ones, and also cultivate more young scholars to work for good causes,"" he said.

China has unveiled a conceptual design for what could potentially become the world's largest nuclear-powered container ship.
The vessel, which has yet to be named, will be powered by molten salt reactors and will have the capacity to carry 24,000 standard containers. In other words, it will be able to hold more than 1 billion boxes of Apple iPhones.
The conceptual design, made by China State Shipbuilding Corp's Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, was published on Tuesday, as the four-day Marintec China 2023 exhibition opened in the city.
The ship's design earned an Approval in Principle certificate from the DNV, one of the world's leading classification societies, at an unveiling ceremony.
A senior researcher at Jiangnan Shipyard, who asked to be identified only as Hu, told China Daily on Wednesday that the idea for a nuclear-powered container ship was the result of the shipyard's endeavor to seek clean energy solutions for its products.
""Shipbuilders around the world have been under huge pressure from shipping businesses, investors and environmentalists to find cleaner fuel solutions. It is only natural for us to take nuclear power into consideration,"" he said.
According to industry statistics, shipping operations account for about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The International Maritime Organization has repeatedly pledged to reduce the emissions caused by shipping businesses.
Hu said the ship will use fourth-generation molten salt reactor technology, which features a very high level of operational safety and an abundance of fail-safe measures.
""Its overall design is based on those of our well-developed container ships. Engineers will only need to modify its power and propulsion systems to fit the nuclear energy,"" he said.
In a news release published on Tuesday, Jiangnan Shipyard said that in addition to the advantages of its nuclear system, the ship will also feature high speed, easy controls and more space for containers.
According to nuclear technology experts, a molten salt reactor is a class of nuclear fission reactor in which both the primary coolant and fuel are a critical concentration of a fissile material dissolved in molten salt.
The International Atomic Energy Agency said that such reactors have been regarded as a promising advanced solution because of the various benefits associated with them. These reactors can operate at higher temperatures, which leads to increased efficiencies in power generation, according to the IAEA.
The low operating pressures inside a molten salt reactor can reduce the risk of a large break and loss of coolant as a result of an accident, thereby enhancing the safety of the reactor. Also, they generate less high-level radioactive waste, and their design does not require solid fuel, eliminating buildup and the need for disposal, the agency said.
Currently, the only nuclear-powered cargo vessel in active service in the world is Russia's Sevmorput, which was built in 1988.

A safety guideline for the use of driverless vehicles in public transportation is expected to further bolster China's leading position in the popularization and commercialization of self-driving technology, experts said.
The guideline, issued on Tuesday by the Ministry of Transport, applies to autonomous vehicles for both passenger and freight transportation services such as taxis, buses and trucks. It covers vehicles with various degrees of automation and mandates that they carry at least one driver or security inspector.
Autonomous vehicles for freight transportation and taxis with conditional automation systems are required to carry one driver. With the approval of local governments, fully autonomous taxis can operate in designated areas with one security inspector remotely overseeing them, the guideline said.
Security inspectors should receive professional training in self-driving technology in a timely manner, master the provisions of road traffic safety laws and regulations, and have the ability to take manual control of such vehicles in case of emergencies, according to the guideline.
It stipulated that one security inspector should not oversee more than three autonomous vehicles at a time, and that these vehicles should operate only in designated areas that have undergone road traffic safety assessment.
Self-driving technology should be used cautiously for passenger transportation services, the document said, adding that driverless buses should operate on fixed routes with simple road conditions and driverless taxis should operate in areas with good traffic conditions, where risks are more manageable.
For freight services, the technology should be employed for point-to-point highway transportation or on safe and controlled city roads. Transporting dangerous goods using autonomous vehicles is prohibited.
Operators using driverless vehicles for public transportation should be certified, and they should ensure their vehicles have eye-catching patterns, colors, signs or words to clearly inform other drivers of the vehicles' autonomous status.
The operators should also notify the passengers about the vehicles' self-driving functions, safety features and emergency escape routes through signs and videos, according to the guideline.
""The guideline is of great significance in promoting the development of autonomous buses,"" Bai Wenxi, chief economist at IPG China, was quoted as saying by Beijing Business Today.
Bai said the guideline will help improve public awareness and acceptance of self-driving technology, as it provides standardized operation procedures and safety measures to make driverless buses safer and more reliable, and also offers policy support and legal protection.
Pan Jun, a senior consultant at Bain & Company, said the popularity of autonomous buses might be influenced by factors such as the comprehensiveness of the legal framework and the technical standard system, market size, cost and economic efficiency.
""With continuous progress in technology and policies, autonomous buses are expected to be widely used in the near future, and even gradually replace traditional buses to become an important part of urban public transportation,"" Pan said.
Acknowledging the long-term prospects, China took self-driving technology as an important direction in the future transformation and upgrading of the automotive industry in 2015, and unveiled a draft strategy for innovation and development of intelligent vehicles in 2018.
The strategy was jointly issued by 11 central government departments, eliminating potential hurdles in cross-departmental collaboration in automotive, telecommunication and mapping services.
As one of the few countries to roll out policies on autonomous vehicles at the national level, China has encouraged local authorities to formulate their respective management regulations and supportive policies, and step up the application and promotion of autonomous vehicles.
As one of the pilot cities for the coordinated development of smart city infrastructure and intelligent vehicles, Shenzhen in Guangdong province issued the first regulation on intelligent vehicle management last year.
Beijing started the construction of autonomous driving pilot areas in 2020, and in 2022, launched China's first demonstration area for commercial self-driving vehicle services in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, where robotaxi operators can charge fares and driverless vehicles can operate with the help of sensing devices and internet of things.

AI governance cannot go without Sino-US cooperation
By Shen Yang (China Daily) 10:55, December 06, 2023

JIN DING/CHINA DAILY
Since the launch of ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, the field of artificial intelligence, especially the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer model, has made significant progress, creating substantial opportunities and, equally substantial, risks. As such, both China and the United States, as global leaders in AI, can play pivotal roles in shaping the AI sector's development.
AI technology is rapidly advancing, particularly in natural language processing, machine learning and complex decision-making capabilities. These advancements signal AI's potential to better understand and emulate human thought processes, fostering greater efficacy across sectors, including improving productivity and driving economic growth.
Yet the transformative impact of AI on the labor market is a double-edged sword. True, AI is creating new employment opportunities. But it is also true that AI could make certain professions obsolete. So it is essential to take measures to prevent or minimize job loss or displacement.
Besides, education and policy adjustments are required to help workers to improve their skills and/or learn new skills, in order to adapt to the changes in the job market. And while governments and educational institutions must collaborate to provide necessary training and resources, and prepare workers to navigate the new work environment, the focus should be on developing strategies that mitigate job losses and harnesses the potential for creating new jobs, ensuring a balanced and inclusive approach to the evolving AI landscape.
To be sure, the future of AI extends beyond its standalone advancement and convergence with diverse fields such as bioscience, materials science and energy. In healthcare, for instance, AI applications can enhance precision medicine, improving treatment and facilitating the discovery of new medicines. As for energy management, AI holds the potential to optimize energy distribution, reduce waste and contribute to environmental protection and sustainable development.
Ethical and moral considerations have become increasingly important due to AI's rapid development, and ensuring transparency in AI decision-making, addressing issues of accountability and preventing the inappropriate use of AI technology have become challenges.
Also, public understanding and acceptance of AI are crucial for the healthy development and responsible use of AI. Education, advanced education in particular, can help individuals better understand the potential and limitations of AI and its social impact.
Governments, educational institutions and businesses should therefore work together to popularize knowledge about AI, so as to foster rational discussions on and responsible use of AI, ensuring it develops robustly and contributes positively to society.
As the impact of AI continues to expand globally, the establishment of an international unified set of AI rules and usage standards has become increasingly crucial. These rules and standards should encompass the demands for transparency in AI decision-making, safeguard data privacy and prevent AI from being used for unethical purposes.
The international community, on its part, must collaboratively strive to formulate and enforce these standards through cross-border cooperation, not least because AI holds immense potential in improving global governance. For instance, using data analysis and pattern recognition, AI can predict and address global conflicts, environmental issues and international economic challenges. So international organizations and governments can leverage AI technology to manage resources more efficiently, respond to crises, and promote global peace and prosperity.
This makes it necessary for China and the US to participate in global discussions on AI governance, because of the significant influence of the two countries in the research and application of AI technology, as well as their crucial roles in shaping relevant policies and standards related to AI.
Since the overarching goal of global AI governance is to ensure technological advancements benefit humankind as a whole while mitigating potential adverse impacts, global cooperation under the framework of a community with a shared future for mankind is paramount for the healthy development of AI. By sharing best practices, coordinating policies and establishing global standards, we can maximize AI technology's global benefits.
The development of AI technology should be inclusive and equitable, and its benefits should extend to all. Hence, considering the needs and interests of different countries and social groups throughout the technological advancement process is crucial to ensuring that.
Also, leveraging AI to optimize resource utilization and environmental protection strategies will have a profound impact on building a sustainable future. The development of AI creates both opportunities and challenges, so it is imperative for the world, especially China and the US, to collaborate to ensure AI development propels economic growth and technological innovation, fosters global cooperation, safeguards social justice, and promotes environmental sustainability.
For this to happen, however, the international community, particularly leading nations in AI technology, needs to make concerted efforts. Through collaboration and strategic policy formulation, the international community can help AI technology become a powerful force driving collective human development, not a source of division and contradictions.
As leaders in AI technology, China and the US play a crucial role in global AI governance and the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind. And global collaboration can help us establish ethical standards, adapt to the changing job market, improve global governance and spread knowledge about AI education. To make such a scenario a reality, governments and businesses need to make collective efforts and implement coordinated policies.
In short, by holding regular dialogue and fostering global cooperation, we can achieve a more equitable, inclusive and sustainable future and make AI technology a positive driver for the common destiny of humankind.

China is proactively reducing its consumption of fossil fuels and is shepherding the research and development of renewable energy, which are solid guarantees that the country will steadfastly achieve its green energy targets, said experts in response to Western media's criticism of China for being silent on promising to phase out the use of fossil fuels.
Countries at the United Nations' COP28 climate conference in the UAE are considering calling for a phase-out of fossil fuels as part of the summit's final deal, according to a draft negotiating text seen by the Straits Times on Tuesday.
Phasing out fossil fuels has become a focal topic in this year's COP. Many foreign media have targeted China, along with other countries, for not acting proactively enough to cut off the use of forms of dirty energy, and for being silent on making promises.
The Straits Times cited a Global Carbon Budget report published on Tuesday which said that CO2 emissions from coal, oil and gas are still rising, driven by India and China. German media Deutsche Welle pointed the finger at both China and the US for being silent on phasing out coal.
China has been active in reducing the consumption of coal and other fossil fuels in recent years, and is shepherding the world in R&D of renewable energy, said Wang Mou from the research center of urban and environment studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He noted that China is definitely on track to meet its target of achieving peak carbon before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060.
China has achieved a significant milestone as its installed capacity of non-fossil energy power generation now accounts for 50.9 percent of the country's total capacity, media reported in June this year.
This achievement surpasses the initial goal of surpassing fossil fuel plants by 2025.
When attending a forum in September this year, Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said that eliminating all fossil fuels is not realistic.
He said that energy transition should respect the national conditions of each country. Moreover, the intermittency of renewable energy should also be considered. In the absence of mature technologies such as large-scale energy storage and transmission, fossil fuels are needed to play a flexible adjustment and backup role to support stable energy supply, and safeguard economic and social development.
Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, who is also attending COP28 in Dubai at the moment, told the Global Times that many countries, especially major economies, are facing great difficulties in phasing out fossil fuels, especially under the current geopolitical tussles, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis, which have stirred up chaos in the global energy market.
Coal demand in Europe went up for the second consecutive year in 2022, led by ""strong growth"" in electricity generation, where it has partly replaced gas as a backup power source, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as Europe cut off gas supply from Russia.
The president of COP28, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, sparked controversies as he claimed during the event that there is ""no science"" indicating that a phase-out of fossil fuels is needed to restrict global heating to 1.5C. He also said a phase-out of fossil fuels would not allow sustainable development ""unless you want to take the world back into caves.""
Wang said that China is still on the road to hasten its energy transition and this direction will not be reversed. But the country, like any other, will strike a balance between economic development and environmental goals.

Int'l conference on vector-borne diseases held in south China
 (Xinhua) 10:23, December 06, 2023
HAIKOU, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on the sustainable control of vector-borne infectious diseases opened Tuesday in Haikou, capital of south China's Hainan Province.
With the aim of coping with global changes, controlling vectors, and protecting the health of all population groups, the conference was attended by more than 300 international academicians, experts, and scholars.
Over the past 10 years or so, China became one of the first countries to eradicate filariasis and was granted by the World Health Organization (WHO) the certification of malaria elimination, as bilharziasis is also currently on the brink of elimination in China, according to the experts.
China has switched its approach to vector-borne diseases from passive emergency control to proactive risk management and control in recent years. The country contributed to building a malaria-free world by sharing its experience, said Liu Qiyong, head of the WHO Collaborating Center for Vector Surveillance and Management and chief expert of vector control at China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Zhang Bike, an official with the CDC, said that back in 2006, there were still over 60,000 cases of malaria and 20,000 cases of epidemic hemorrhagic fever in China, and it took the country just over 10 years to get them under control. He added that China has made historic achievements in preventing and controlling such diseases.
China should continue to innovate its strategy and technology for preventing and controlling vector-borne diseases and further benefit China and the world with the innovative concept of sustainable control of vectors, according to Li Guanglin, an official with the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association.

Chinese researchers invent new nerve electrode for stroke treatment
 (Xinhua) 09:41, December 06, 2023
CHANGCHUN, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese researchers recently developed a new type of implantable hydrogel nerve electrode to improve the recovery of mice after suffering strokes, shedding light on stroke treatment using brain-computer interface technology.
Stroke is one of the main causes of hemiplegia and motor disability. Emerging brain-computer interface technology is expected to achieve regulation of neuron firing behavior, synaptic function and the brain nerve circuit, while promoting the recovery of damaged brain neurons and nerve circuits.
The research team, led by Zhang Qiang with the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed a new type of implantable hydrogel nerve electrode, which can obtain brain nerve information in situ and regulate brain nerves at the single-cell level.
The team monitored brain nerve information for eight consecutive weeks and used photogenetic nerve regulation technology to regulate both neural circuits in the brain and limb responses. The regulation of injured neurons in brain areas of mice damaged by strokes can effectively reduce the brain tissue infarct area and promote the recovery of motor functions.
This technology has made progress in terms of nerve sensing electrode design, nerve signal monitoring, nerve regulation, and stroke treatment, while it also has application value in obtaining brain nerve information and treating brain dysfunction, according to Zhang.
The study was published in the journal Advanced Materials.

Chinese scientists design octopus-inspired, tentacle-like robot arm
 (Xinhua) 09:36, December 06, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to detect unknown environments, a Chinese team created an octopus-inspired flexible robotic arm capable of sensing and manipulating objects in confined spaces and underwater.
According to the study published in the latest edition of Science Robotics, the robot allowed blindfolded human operators to guide its arm, using suction to pick up various objects, including a toy shark and a smooth metal ball, via a single-finger glove.
This new invention created by a team of researchers, led by Wen Li from Beihang University was inspired by the octopus, which whips its soft arms in a characteristic ""bend propagation"" motion to capture its prey with sensitive suckers.
A simple strategy like this can be used as a model for robotic grasping, controllable with a few inputs, as well as a highly deformable arm with sensing capabilities.
Wen's team integrated electronics and circuits into the robots while maintaining their deformability. The researchers presented a stretchable electronics-integrated soft octopus arm with 16 air-driven actuators and multiple degrees of freedom.
The robot's stretchable, liquid-metal-based electronic circuit can withstand uniaxial stretching of 710 percent and biaxial stretching of 270 percent to perform tasks autonomously in a confined environment, findings from the study showed.
The soft arm with two rows of sensory suction cups that connect with the wearer's finger can perform a reaching-grasping-withdrawing motion across a range of up to 1.5 times its original arm length, similar to the biological counterpart, the study revealed.
""This robotic prototype provides new prospects and development ideas for the future interactive applications of flexible robots, including medical auxiliary robots, seabed exploration robots, and bionic external organs,"" said Wen.
