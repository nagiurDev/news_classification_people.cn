Proportion of 'lighthouse factories' from China reaches new high in WEF’s new list,2024-10-09,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1009/c90000-20227264.html,"Home>>
		
Proportion of 'lighthouse factories' from China reaches new high in WEF’s new list
 (Global Times) 13:22, October 09, 2024
The proportion of lighthouse factories from China reached a record high in the new list released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Tuesday, highlighting the continuous efforts of Chinese companies to accelerate technology transformation and upgrading in the manufacturing sector.
The WEF announced that 22 innovative manufacturers have joined the Global Lighthouse Network, including the latest cohort of 19 Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and three Sustainability Lighthouses across 10 countries, such as China, the Czech Republic and Germany.
Of the total, 13 factories are located in China, accounting for nearly 60 percent, a record high.
Among the 19 new lighthouse factories this year, Mengniu Dairy (Ningxia) Co, SANY Renewable Energy in Shaoshan, Sanmen Nuclear Power Co, Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery (Group) Co and Taiyuan Heavy Industry Railway Transit Equipment Co are the world's first lighthouse factories in their respective sectors - dairy, wind energy equipment, nuclear power, coal mining machinery, and rail transit equipment.
Additionally, a Chinese company established the first overseas lighthouse factory. Foxconn Industrial Internet Viet Nam Co overcame challenges like reliance on imported materials and focused on developing local talent. By implementing 40+ 4IR use cases, including advanced planning and AI-driven automation, the site increased labor productivity by 190 percent, achieved 99.5 percent on-time delivery and cut manufacturing costs by 45 percent.
Digital technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and machine learning are key features of this batch of the ""lighthouse factories.""
The listed Hefei Midea Washing Machine Co told the Global Times that it has continued to explore and reconstruct new end-to-end green and sustainable capabilities, and has extensively deployed digital technologies to apply artificial intelligence in the product designing, manufacturing, and broad logistics.
Zhang Xiaoyi, vice president and CDO of Midea Group, said that the in-depth application of AI in the entire factory process covers 457 sub-scenarios, mainly through self-developed small sample intelligent algorithms and AI development cloud platforms, as well as IT&OT compound organizational construction guarantees, to cut large-scale promotion and operation and maintenance costs, which has helped cut energy consumption by 37.6 percent, and optimize logistical efficiency by 29 percent.
The latest cohort of Lighthouses reported an average 50 percent boost in labor productivity, due to various digital solutions such as interactive training programs, smart devices and wearables, and automated systems combining robotics, AI, and machine vision.
Process modelling and root-cause analytics have also unlocked efficiency gains across Lighthouses' end-to-end supply chains, on average reducing energy consumption by 22 percent, inventory by 27 percent, and scrap or waste by 55 percent, WEF said.
Karel Eloot, a global senior partner at McKinsey, said that the ""lighthouse factories"" have truly surpassed the pilot stage, and currently nearly 60 percent of core application cases use advanced artificial intelligence technology, comparing to just 11 percent in 2019. This reflects that artificial intelligence is reshaping manufacturing and has reached an unprecedented level of maturity.
Lighthouse factories are known as ""the most advanced factories in the world"". McKinsey defines them as factories that have successfully transitioned Fourth Industrial Revolution technology from the pilot stage to large-scale integration, achieving significant financial and operational benefits.
Since the first selection in 2018, a total of 172 ""lighthouse factories"" around the world, with 74 factories located in China, representing 43 percent.
The Global Lighthouse Network is a global initiative created by the WEF and McKinsey in 2018. It has since released twelve lists of 'lighthouse factories'.

Chinese hospital promotes heart disease treatment without radiation
 (Xinhua) 15:29, October 07, 2024
BEIJING, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese hospital specializing in cardiovascular care has widely applied a radiation-free percutaneous intervention method in its treatment of heart disease.
The treatment, introduced by Fuwai Hospital under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), is guided by ultrasound images and involves sending the treatment instruments from the peripheral blood into the heart in a minimally invasive manner.
This method avoids the use of surgery and radiation, and even allows patients to remain awake during the treatment process.
Pregnant women, allergy sufferers and cancer patients can also receive this treatment, and the technical difficulty has been reduced as expensive imported large devices are not required, according to the hospital.
This procedure is expected to enhance the capacity of primary medical services and make effective heart disease treatment available to outpatients. Therefore, access to heart disease treatment in countries and regions with limited medical resources will be improved.
This form of heart treatment has received funding from the United Nations.
Thus far, Fuwai Hospital has invented more than 17 new treatments to deal with different types of cardiovascular diseases such as congenital heart disease, valvular disease and arrhythmia -- achieving 65 patents.
In addition, the hospital has also developed a series of therapeutic instruments and equipment, including an ultrasonic catheter and a surgical robot. Of these items, 23 are available both in China and abroad.
Medical teams from the hospital have been invited to conduct surgeries and introduce Chinese treatment solutions in more than 30 countries, including France, Germany, Canada, Russia and Kenya.

Study indentifies 9 species of critically endangered Chinese salamander
 (Xinhua) 10:14, October 07, 2024
LONDON, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- The latest cutting-edge research has confirmed that there are nine different species of the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander.
Published recently in the Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society, the research led by the conservation charity that runs London Zoo has shone a new light on the ancient animal.
A team from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), an international conservation charity driven by science, working with partners in China, used genetic data to study the world's largest amphibian, once thought to be a single species found across central and southern China.
Chinese giant salamanders can grow up to 1.8 meters long. Their loose, baggy skin helps them absorb oxygen from the water, while tiny sensors across their bodies detect vibrations from worms, crustaceans, small fish, and frogs, compensating for their poor eyesight.
""There is a high likelihood that Chinese giant salamanders face extinction in the wild, and it is extremely important to work collaboratively to prevent extinction being the fate of these ancient animals,"" Ben Tapley, curator of reptiles and amphibians at London Zoo and one of the paper's co-authors, told Xinhua.
""Our research shows that there are up to nine different species of Chinese giant salamander, but only four have been named by scientists, and only two have had their conservation status assessed, with both being categorized as critically endangered,"" Tapley added.
""Chinese giant salamanders are recognized as critically endangered. All of the species we've now identified are at high risk of disappearing forever,"" said Samuel Turvey, a researcher at ZSL and an author of the paper. ""If we are to avoid losing the world's largest amphibians, we need to act urgently to ensure that these newly-recognized species are formally recognized and legally protected.""
""The possibility that Chinese giant salamanders may not be a single species has been suggested by researchers for 20 years, but by comparing levels of genetic difference seen across giant salamander populations with differences shown by other known salamander species, we can now confirm this for sure,"" said Turvey.

A glimpse into China's 75 years of innovation through intellectual property endeavors,2024-10-05,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1005/c90000-20226189.html,"Home>>
		
A glimpse into China's 75 years of innovation through intellectual property endeavors
 (Xinhua) 10:40, October 05, 2024
BEIJING, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- The evolution of intellectual property (IP) in China provides valuable insights into the country's 75-year journey of innovation.
Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, IP initiatives have been vital in protecting individual inventions, fostering enterprise competitiveness, and driving scientific advancement and economic growth.
RECOGNITION OF KNOWLEDGE
Thirty-nine years ago, when Hu Guohua applied for an invention patent, he had to queue overnight outside a national office of patents. The following day, April 1, 1985, marked the enactment of China's Patent Law, leading to over 3,400 applications from both domestic and international sources, setting a daily record in patent history at that time.
Eight months later, Hu received a patent certificate for his invention, a color display device to help analyze satellite images. Newspapers splashed photos of the spectacled aerospace engineer, who became China's first patent rights holder.

Hu Guohua (1st R), who submitted China's first invention patent application, shows his patent certificate at a press conference held in Beijing, capital of China, Dec. 11, 2018. (Xinhua)
The inventor, now 83, continues his relentless pursuit of innovation. According to a report in China Intellectual Property News, last week an astronomical observatory installed a patented solar simulator luminescent device he invented.
""The patent system has recognized the value of knowledge, thereby stimulating innovation,"" Hu said.
In the 1960s, most Chinese people were unaware of IP. Through recommendation letters, sci-tech researchers could gain access to each other's inventions. While such practices helped popularize technologies, they failed to protect individual work and ideas adequately, ultimately hindering long-term innovation, Hu noted.
Since the 1980s, China has implemented a series of laws relating to intellectual property, including Trademark Law, Patent Law and Copyright Law. These laws have undergone constant revisions based on practical experience to ensure stronger legislative protection. Particularly noteworthy is the newly enacted Civil Code, which has established a punitive damage system for infringement that is considered to be of high standard internationally.
The central government has also put IP protection high on its agenda, carrying out a series of measures to enhance efficiency and combat improper behavior.

Hu Guohua (1st R) speaks to journalists after submitting his invention patent application outside a national office of patents in Beijing, capital of China, April 1, 1985. (Xinhua)
Hu's first patent certificate is now part of the National Museum of China's collection since the patent has expired. Today, patent certificates are far more common in China.
By the end of 2023, China became the first country in the world with more than 4 million valid invention patents.
From only 98 patent applications filed through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1994 to 59,000 in 2019, China also rose as the leading global source of international patent applications and has stayed at the top ever since.
PROTECTION FOR ENTERPRISES
Enterprises are the main contributors to China's position as the world's largest patent filer. While cost-effectiveness was once their primary competitive advantage for market penetration, the growing trend of international expansion has prompted a shift toward IP competitiveness. They now acknowledge that prioritizing innovation is essential for achieving sustainable development.
Goodbaby serves as a prime example. In 2014, the Chinese child products company filed a design patent application for a stroller that revolutionized the industry. The product, made from lightweight aerospace-grade aluminum alloy, weighs only 4.6 kilograms and has been acclaimed as the ""pocket stroller"" since its launch as it can fit easily into a backpack. In the same year, the company entered the global market through international mergers and acquisitions.
However, the product faced intense patent infringement upon entering the market. The company successfully defended its rights and won lawsuits at home and abroad. Currently, the core patents for this China-designed stroller have been authorized in over 30 countries.

""Having our own brand gives us control over development destiny, and strong IP protection ensures a solid guarantee,"" said the company's IP officer Tu Zuhong.
Nihat Deniz Bayramoglu, at Bayramoglu Law Offices LLC based in Las Vegas, the United States, has been providing IP consultation services in China since the 2010s. The company helps Chinese clients file around 3,000 patent and trademark applications each year. He found that Chinese enterprises are increasingly recognizing the importance of IP protection.
""In the past, only large Chinese multinationals were interested in applying for IP rights abroad, and now much smaller Chinese companies are also trying to protect IP rights,"" the attorney told Xinhua at the 13th China Intellectual Property Annual Conference held in Beijing in September.
""In the past, many of the Chinese companies I represented were only defendants in court cases, and now many of my Chinese clients are plaintiffs in the United States suing American companies for patent infringement,"" he said.
He added that the perception in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s that China was involved in producing counterfeit products and did not respect IP rights will gradually be replaced by the reality that ""Chinese companies are now at the forefront of cutting-edge technological innovation.""

As China accelerates its global expansion, the world has increasingly engaged with the Chinese market.
China is committed to providing equal IP protection for both domestic and foreign enterprises. More than 5,000 foreign and joint venture companies have been registered in the country's state-level IP protection centers, and over the past decade, China's IP regulators have resolved several IP disputes involving companies from countries like the United States, Germany and France.
According to the China National Intellectual Property Administration, by the end of June, the number of valid foreign invention patents and registered trademarks in China showed year-on-year increases of 3.9 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, demonstrating the strong commitment of foreign enterprises to the Chinese market and their confidence in China's IP protection work.
CONTRIBUTION TO MODERNIZATION
According to the WIPO's Global Innovation Index 2024, which serves as a critical benchmark for global innovation trends, China has climbed to 11th place in the ranking of the world's most innovative economies.
The WIPO director general, Daren Tang, attributed China's progress to its focus on research and development and scientific innovation.

China's IP now extends to almost every field of cutting-edge innovation, from supercomputers to artificial intelligence. An exemplary achievement in this regard is China's role in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a large scientific project that aims to replicate the sun's fusion process to produce clean energy. In April 2021, ITER reached a milestone with the installation of its first large superconducting coil.
At the heart of this technological breakthrough lies a Chinese patent invention about the manufacturing of superconducting magnets for nuclear fusion. Song Yuntao, one of the patent holders and the director-general of the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the patent ""demonstrates the contribution of Chinese wisdom to advancing humanity's quest for fusion energy.""
IP has not only boosted sci-tech advancements but also propelled economic growth.
With an average annual growth rate of 12.4 percent since 2021, the added value of China's patent-intensive industries reached 15.32 trillion yuan (about 2.19 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2022, contributing 12.7 percent to the GDP of the world's second-largest economy.

In the digital economy sector, in particular, 406,000 invention patents were authorized in core industries last year, representing 45 percent of the country's total. Over the past five years, this sector has seen an average annual growth rate of 21 percent.
Starting from humble beginnings, China has emerged as the world's largest patent filer and is advancing toward becoming an IP powerhouse. The government has pledged to continue leveraging intellectual property to boost innovation and support Chinese modernization.

Scientists discover thickest glacier on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau
 (Xinhua) 14:52, October 01, 2024
LHASA, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have identified the thickest glacier on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, known as Asia's water tower, following the discovery of a nearly 400-meter-thick ice field.
The ice field, with a maximum measured thickness of nearly 400 meters, is part of the Purog Kangri Glacier in Tsonyi County, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, according to researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
The measurement has determined that the Purog Kangri Glacier is now the thickest glacier on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, replacing the Guliya Ice Cap in Ngari Prefecture.
Researchers employed radar equipment in the measurement and determined the thickness of the ice by reading the reflection of electromagnetic waves.
Glaciers contain important information about the Earth's climate history. Previously, scientists drilled a 308.6-meter ice core from Guliya, which was formed over a period of more than 700,000 years.
Scientists are currently extracting ice cores from the Purog Kangri Glacier, which they believe contain older ice.
""Thickness measurement and ice core analysis help us better understand bygone environmental changes, as well as how global warming affects glaciers, which impacts lakes, rivers and people's living environment,"" said Yao Tandong, an academician of the CAS.
The measurement is part of China's second scientific expedition and research project on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, initiated in August 2017 and headed by Yao.
""Currently, glaciers worldwide are retreating. Once they melt, the historical records encapsulated within them will also disappear,"" said Lonnie Thompson, a foreign academician of the CAS and a member of the American Academy of Sciences.
""Therefore, extracting and preserving ice cores is crucial for retrieving historical information,"" added Thompson, who took part in the measurement process.

A team of Chinese researchers has developed a new biological vascular graft that could revolutionize cardiovascular procedures, potentially reducing infection rates and medical costs.
Cardiovascular disease remains a major global health issue, with higher incidence and mortality rates compared to many other diseases. Vascular replacement, bypass surgeries and arteriovenous grafts for hemodialysis are increasingly common procedures requiring vascular grafts.
The innovative graft, composed of degradable polymer materials and extracellular matrix, was developed by a team led by Professor Kong Deling at Nankai University.
Cheng Quhan, a Ph.D. candidate on Professor Kong's team, told People's Daily Online that the biological vascular grafts can replace or bypass diseased blood vessels in cardiovascular patients, establish hemodialysis access in patients with end-stage renal disease and repair vascular trauma caused by accidents or other reasons. The use of these grafts is expected to reduce infection rates, decrease the risk of thrombosis and lower medical costs.
Professor Kong's team is currently conducting large-scale phase III clinical trials to gain regulatory approval for commercial use. They have also published research papers and filed several patents.

GUANGZHOU, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have discovered a new cyprinid fish species, Opsariichthys rubriventris, in Huizhou City in south China's Guangdong Province.
In a paper published in the international journal Diversity, Opsariichthys rubriventris is described as a unique species endemic to Guangdong, residing in the upper reaches of rivers in the Pearl River basin.
The species can be distinguished from its relatives by several characteristics, including 13 to 14 predorsal scales, a lower jaw that projects slightly beyond the upper jaw, and cheeks featuring two mainly longitudinal rows of tubercles. Additionally, adult males exhibit reddish-orange coloration on their lower jaw, belly, pectoral fin and the anterior margin of their anal fin.
Zhou Jiajun, a co-author of the paper, noted that the discovery is significant for understanding the evolution of the Opsariichthys genus and for the protection of fish diversity in the Pearl River streams.
According to Zhou, the species has a narrow distribution range and small population size. With its vibrant colors and high ornamental value, it has become sought after in the ornamental fish trade. However, some habitats have become difficult to locate due to overfishing, highlighting the need for increased attention and protection.

Chinese researchers achieve breakthrough in DNA-based storage of brain MRI data
 (Xinhua) 09:52, September 30, 2024
TIANJIN, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin University's Frontiers Science Center for Synthetic Biology, in collaboration with Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, has made a major breakthrough in DNA-based data storage, introducing the innovative DNA Palette coding scheme.
This new method enables the successful encoding of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data into DNA, as well as lossless decoding and the 3D reconstruction of imaging data, paving the way for the development of advanced medical data storage technologies.
The results of the study that saw this breakthrough have been published in the National Science Review.
Brain MRI scans are an essential tool for clinical diagnosis, surgical planning and treatment evaluation. However, the vast amounts of data generated during these scans pose significant challenges for long-term storage methods.
This issue is particularly critical for diseases such as juvenile Parkinson's, epilepsy and neurogenetic disorders, as lifelong data accumulation and analysis are essential in such cases. Current storage mediums struggle to meet the high demand for large-scale, long-term data storage.
DNA, known to have exceptional stability and storage density, has emerged as a promising medium for data storage. The Tianjin University research team successfully encoded 11.28 megabytes of brain MRI data into approximately 250,000 DNA sequences, achieving an impressive data density of 2.39 bits per base.
The encoded oligos, which are single strands of synthetic DNA, are stored in dry powder form, weigh just 3 micrograms and support over 300 read operations under current technical standards. This breakthrough demonstrates DNA's potential as a long-term, efficient, secure storage medium for medical data.
This study marks a crucial step toward the practical application of DNA data storage, offering a new technical route for the secure storage of large amounts of medical data and accelerating the broader adoption of DNA-based storage technologies.

BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- China launched its first satellite, Dongfanghong-1, on April 24, 1970, ushering in the nation's exploration of the universe and its peaceful use of outer space. Five decades on, China's unremitting space exploration efforts are unlocking a wealth of insights concerning the cosmos.

This image taken from video animation at Beijing Aerospace Control Center (BACC) on June 2, 2024 shows the lander-ascender combination of Chang'e-6 probe landing on the far side of the moon. (Xinhua/Jin Liwang)
LUNAR EXPLORATION
A recent study of the lunar samples returned by the Chang'e-5 probe revealed that the moon might have been geologically active as recently as 120 million years ago, while another fresh research finding indicated that samples obtained via Chang'e-6 exhibit ""distinct characteristics"" compared to previously obtained lunar samples.
This deepening understanding of the moon stems from China's unwavering commitment to its lunar exploration program.
""We have been actively developing relevant technologies and cultivating talent for research on lunar samples since 2004,"" said Li Qiuli, a researcher who led the aforementioned study of the Chang'e-5 lunar samples at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
In December 2020, the Chang'e-5 probe brought back the country's first samples collected from the moon, which marked a successful conclusion to China's three-step lunar exploration program of orbiting, landing and returning samples, which began in 2004.
""The samples collected so far mainly come from the lunar surface. We are looking forward to obtaining deeper core samples, ideally reaching the unaltered bedrock beneath the impact-modified layers, allowing us to further explore the history of the moon's transformation,"" said Li.
China is now focusing on the fourth phase of its lunar exploration program, which includes the completed Chang'e-4 and Chang'e-6 missions, and the upcoming Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 missions.
In 2024, the Chang'e-6 mission achieved a historic first by collecting 1,935.3 grams of lunar samples from the far side of the moon. China is scheduled to launch the Chang'e-7 lunar exploration mission in around 2026 and Chang'e-8 in about 2028.
In addition, China in 2023 initiated the lunar landing mission of its manned lunar exploration program, aiming to realize a manned lunar landing by 2030.
China is also advancing the construction of an international lunar research station (ILRS), and Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 will form part of the basic model of the ILRS.

SPACE LABORATORY
In the early hours of May 1, 2024, just hours after the Shenzhou-17 crew touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 20 scientists, over a thousand kilometers away in Beijing, eagerly awaited the arrival of experimental samples brought back from space.
Weighing approximately 31.5 kilograms, these samples included human osteoblasts, protein crystals, seeds and high-temperature materials. The scientists affectionately referred to these returned samples as ""space specialties.""
China's orbiting Tiangong space station, which serves as a national space laboratory, is T-shaped with the Tianhe core module at the center and the Wentian and Mengtian experiment capsules located on the sides.
The Tianhe core module primarily focuses on space medicine, space science experiments and technology testing, while the Wentian lab module is dedicated to research in the field of space life sciences. The Mengtian lab module mainly serves microgravity science research.
""The space laboratory provides excellent research conditions, such as long-term microgravity and radiation environments, allowing us to explore the mechanisms behind new phenomena and understand the measures necessary for humanity's long-term survival in space,"" said Zhang Wei, a researcher at the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization under the CAS.
According to a press conference held by the China Manned Space Agency in April 2024, China had conducted over 130 scientific research and application projects in its orbiting space station, while 300 scientific experiment samples had been brought back from space by manned missions in five batches.
In addition, more than 500 scientific research institutes worldwide had participated in these projects, achieving significant results in space life science, space medicine, space material science and microgravity fluid physics -- with over 280 papers published in top international journals, the agency said.

ASTRONOMICAL SATELLITES
China's Einstein Probe (EP) astronomical satellite beamed back X-ray images of the moon from space on Sept. 17. These images were captured by the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) aboard the EP, marking the first time Chinese scientists had obtained a comprehensive X-ray scan of the moon with an independently developed space telescope.
Compared to other X-ray satellites currently in operation internationally, the FXT offers a superior X-ray energy resolution and high effective area, enabling it to reveal the distribution of lunar surface elements such as oxygen, iron, magnesium, aluminum and silicon.
Thirty years ago, Yuan Weimin, who is now principal investigator of the EP, was thrilled to learn from an academic report by Li Tibei, an academician of the CAS, that China was set to develop its own astronomical satellites.
""Before that, I never imagined our generation would have the capability to develop the country's own space science satellites. From that moment on, I heartily anticipated the implementation of the plan,"" said Yuan, who is also a researcher at the National Astronomical Observatories under the CAS.
China now boasts a fleet of space science satellites in the vast expanse of space, including the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, the Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (the world's first quantum satellite), the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), and the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S).
These space science satellites have contributed to a slew of scientific achievements. In 2020, scientists, using the HXMT, discovered the strongest magnetic field ever observed in the universe, located on the surface of a neutron star named GRO J1008-57, while the ASO-S has detected more than 100 solar white-light flares since its launch in 2022, which is of scientific significance for space weather forecasting.
""While Europe and the United States have been developing space science for more than half a century, China is still in its initial stages of development. However, we have made remarkable progress over the past 20 years and have entered the international forefront in certain fields,"" Yuan added.

Profile: Wang Yongzhi, visionary rocket designer and manned spaceflight planner
 (Xinhua) 14:23, September 29, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yongzhi, a visionary rocket expert and pioneer of China's manned space program, was recently awarded the Medal of the Republic, about three months after his passing away.
Wang was one of the 15 individuals honored with national medals and honorary titles on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In 1932, he was born to a poor rural family in northeast China's Liaoning Province. During his time in middle school, he aspired to become an agronomist.
However, after the outbreak of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, frequent incursions by American warplanes in eastern Liaoning Province transformed this young man's dreams. He decided to devote himself to national defense.
In 1952, he was admitted to Tsinghua University, majoring in aircraft design. In 1955, he was sent to study in the department of aeronautics at the Moscow Aviation Institute.
After returning to China, he started working on rocket design and development.
ROCKET DEVELOPMENT IN 18 MONTHS
In 1986, the U. S. Challenger space shuttle, Titan rocket and Delta rocket all suffered launch failures, leading to a shortage of launch capabilities in the international market.
At that time, Wang, who was head of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), found this market opportunity and immediately proposed the development of a Long March strap-on rocket to provide international launch services.
In November 1988, China signed a contract for the launch service of an Australian satellite with Hughes Aircraft of the United States. This was the first commercial launch contract signed between China and a foreign company. The CALT was responsible for the design and development of the launch vehicle.
The challenges Wang faced extended beyond the fact that the rocket was still in the blueprint phase. He also had to contend with the fact that time was extremely limited. The design and development had to be completed within 18 months.
Some foreign peers thought he was crazy. In their view, it would usually take several years or even a decade to complete the design and development of a new rocket.
Wang and his colleagues took the challenge head on. They worked around the clock, finished more than 440,000 design drawings, over 120 technical research and development projects, and hundreds of thousands of parts. They also carried out over 300 large-scale ground tests, and overcame 20 technical challenges.
On June 29, 1990, the Long March-2E, China's first carrier rocket with strap-on boosters, finally stood at the launch site of the Xichang Satellite Launch Center one day ahead of the contract deadline, and made its successful maiden flight on July 16, 1990.
Developing a new carrier rocket model in 18 months, Wang and his colleagues set a world record at that time.
PIONEER OF MANNED SPACE PROGRAM
In 1992, Wang proposed a three-step plan of developing spacecraft, space lab and space station for the country's manned space program. After the plan was approved the same year, he was appointed as the program's chief designer.
At the age of 60, he took on one of the most challenging tasks in space exploration. From the very beginning of the program, he aimed for the world's third-generation manned spacecraft and led the team to adopt the mainstream three-person, three-module design scheme.
During the design and manufacturing of the launch vehicle for manned space program, his team made nearly one thousand technical breakthroughs, making the Long March-2F rocket the most reliable rocket in China.
China's manned space program has developed rapidly, and Wang has been awarded numerous honors. In 2010, an asteroid numbered 46669 was named after him for his contributions to the development of the space industry.
Every time he received an honor, he would say that the honor belongs to all the people who have contributed to China's space endeavors.
After retirement, Wang still cared about the manned space program and continued to provide suggestions for the building of China's space station and manned lunar landing program.
His wife Wang Danyang said that in the last months of his life, he could no longer move his body freely, and almost lost his eyesight, ""but he still kept talking about things in space, about lunar landing.""
Wang Yongzhi passed away on June 11, 2024. What he left to his family were only hundreds of notebooks and more than a dozen pieces of oral histories about his work.

Science meets education -- China turns to schools to help build sci-tech powerhouse,2024-09-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0929/c90000-20225053.html,"Home>>
		
Science meets education -- China turns to schools to help build sci-tech powerhouse
 (Xinhua) 13:56, September 29, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-tech show was staged recently at the playground of a primary school in a small county. Students seated in a circle were captivated by a robot dog skilled at flipping over and dancing. It even made a bow and shook hands with the audience.
""I got to touch the robot dog, and it was so interesting. I will work hard and learn more about it,"" said Mou Yuejia, a student at the primary school in Tonghai County, southwest China's Yunnan Province.
The show was part of an activity held to popularize science and technology upon campus. It featured exhibits about ecological protection, sci-tech innovation and some instruments demonstrating how to generate wind power.
""Next we will get in closer touch with schools and present the latest sci-tech results to students to inspire their interest and help increase people's knowledge of science,"" said Ding Chao, chairman of the science and technology association of Tonghai County, which organized the event.
Since mid-September, a wave of science popularity has swept across China, with some 200,000 activities of various types held on the theme of raising scientific literacy among the public and contributing to building a country that leads in science and technology.
Beyond the science popularization activities, Chinese schools are also springing in action on their own. This autumn semester, many schools made adjustments to their science courses in alignment with the frontiers of new technologies and explored new ways to make such classes more attractive.
Pouring water, oil and effervescent tablets into a cup, Feng Jiaqi, a pupil at a primary school in the city of Zhengzhou, deftly conducted a scientific experiment simulating volcanic eruptions. ""As the density of water is bigger than oil, the two will be clearly divided, with oil on top of water,"" Feng explained.
The school in the capital of central China's Henan Province added scientific practice courses and arranged more science classes for its first- and second-grade students this semester.
In east China's Fujian Province, more than 300 university-based laboratories and science and technology museums were engaged in tailoring off-campus science classes for primary and middle school students. They customized the procedures of such classes together with teachers.
""There will inevitably be all kinds of problems in the process of exploring science, from which students can have a real experience of scientific practice,"" said Cai Minggang, a professor at Xiamen University.
In December 2023, Fujian put forward 20 measures to improve science education, including deepening curriculum and teaching reforms, improving education resources and giving play to the public sites that are suitable for science popularization.
In particular, it required opening such sites as science and technology museums, observatories, and memorial halls of scientists to primary and middle school students free of charge. Some research institutes were made open to the public for the first time, covering the sectors of science, agriculture and environment.
These local efforts were made in response to a set of guidelines on strengthening the education of science for primary and middle school students that was released by the Ministry of Education and 17 other authorities last May.
The document urged efforts to mobilize social forces such as universities, research institutes, children's palaces, museums and libraries to open their respective venues, bases, parks or even production lines to students to help underpin scientific practice education.
The latest statistics show that there are 1,683 sci-tech and related museums across the country, of which 1,090 are free to the public.
People's scientific knowledge to some extent determines the country's development in the sector of science and technology. China aims to become a global leader in science and technology by 2035. Taking education and technology as basic underpinnings for Chinese modernization, it is committed to the strategy of invigorating China through science and education.
""Social forces have rich resources for education on science and have widened the boundary of education,"" said Huang Xiao, dean of the College of Education, Zhejiang Normal University, calling for greater efforts to build consensus, do a good job of top-level design and optimize resource layout to further improve science education.

China completes trial run of unmanned heavy-haul train on major coal transport route
 (Global Times) 13:32, September 29, 2024
China completed a trial operation of an unmanned heavy-haul train on the railway connecting North China's Hebei and East China's Shandong provinces, marking a key milestone in advancing from automated to unmanned heavy-haul railway technology.
The test train, comprising 108 cars with a total length of nearly 1,300 meters and a total weight of 10,800 tons, traveled from Huanghua city in Hebei to Dongying city in Shandong in two and a half hours on Thursday, according to China Media Group (CMG). The test route is primarily used for coal transport.
Once unmanned driving is widely adopted, the average operation speed of the nation's trains will be increased by 1.7 kilometers per hour, while the average traction energy consumption will decrease by 2.9 percent, significantly boosting the transportation efficiency of China's west-to-east coal transportation, CMG reported.
Previously, the unmanned train technology was primarily used in urban rail systems both in China and abroad, and has not yet been applied on a large scale on heavy-haul transport railways.
The test train was independently produced and controlled, from key technologies to management models, according to the Economic Information Daily. The research team created China's first smart heavy-haul railway transportation paradigm featuring a centralized station control system and intelligent train driving system.
Three key technologies of the test train - comprehensive support and simulation, remote control and autonomous driving, and integrated safety monitoring from air, space, and ground - fill critical manufacturing gaps in China.
The Line 27 phase I of the subway system in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province, commenced no-load trial operation on September 19, 2024. It will be the city's second fully automated subway line, after Line 9, which launched in December 2020, China News Service reported.
