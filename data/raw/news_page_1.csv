The Tianlai experimental array, China's first dark energy radio detection project, has been successfully certified as a SKA Pathfinder by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) organization, an intergovernmental organization with 10 international member states, the Global Times learned from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Monday. The recognition is expected to offer new opportunities for scientific exploration and test innovative detection technologies for the SKA.
The project is located at an observation station in Hami, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It primarily conducts neutral hydrogen surveys, which are used to study the large-scale structure of the universe, dark energy, and other cutting-edge cosmological topics.
According to astronomical observations, about 70 percent of the universe is composed of mysterious dark energy, which is causing the accelerated expansion of the universe.
The array features both cylindrical and dish-shaped antennas. The cylindrical array consists of three paraboloid reflector antennas, each equipped with 96 feeds, while the dish array includes 16 six-meter diameter parabolic antennas.
As a SKA Pathfinder project, the Tianlai array can test technologies for detecting neutral hydrogen, allowing for the extraction of faint 21-centimeter hydrogen signals. ""These techniques can be applied to the SKA project. Through practical observations and data analyses, we can identify real-world issues that theoretical analyses alone cannot fully address,"" said Chen Xuelei, chief scientist of the Tianlai project and researcher at the National Astronomical Observatories.
Robert Braun, the science director of the SKA, noted that the Tianlai project will pave the way for the SKA radio observatory. Although the organization is in its initial operational phase, the existing radio antennas and experimental projects will continue to provide insights for scientific plans and research foundations, Braun said.
In addition, these technologies can also be applied to future large-scale astronomical telescope projects, the Global Times learned from the National Astronomical Observatories.
The SKA is a next-generation giant radio telescope array currently under construction, representing an intergovernmental collaboration involving 10 countries, including China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. The SKA Pathfinder project includes various large scientific instruments from around the world related to SKA science and technology.

Chinese developer launches multimodal model unifying video, image, text
 (Xinhua) 09:27, October 22, 2024
BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) on Monday released Emu3, a multimodal world model that unifies the understanding and generation of text, image, and video modalities with next-token prediction.
Emu3 successfully validates that next-token prediction can serve as a powerful paradigm for multimodal models, scaling beyond language models and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal tasks, said Wang Zhongyuan, director of BAAI, in a press release.
""By tokenizing images, text, and videos into a discrete space, we train a single transformer from scratch on a mixture of multimodal sequences,"" Wang said, adding that Emu3 eliminates the need for diffusion or compositional approaches entirely.
Emu3 outperforms several well-established task-specific models in both generation and perception tasks, according to BAAI, which has open-sourced the key technologies and models of Emu3 to the international technology community.
Technology practitioners have said that a new opportunity has emerged to explore multimodality through a unified architecture, eliminating the need to combine complex diffusion models with large language models (LLMs).
""In the future, the multimodal world model will promote scenario applications such as robot brains, autonomous driving, multimodal dialogue and inference,"" Wang said.

Domestic AI models tackle unique demands of Cantonese,2024-10-21,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1021/c90000-20231529.html,"Home>>
		
Domestic AI models tackle unique demands of Cantonese
By Oasis Hu (China Daily) 08:30, October 21, 2024

(LU PING/CHINA DAILY)
""Is there a wife in a wife cake?"" Heyson He Lixi, an influencer promoting Cantonese, asked.
""There is no actual wife in a wife cake, as it is just a traditional Hong Kong pastry,"" answered SenseChat, the world's first Cantonese large language model, a ChatGPT-like product, in fluent Cantonese.
He raised a more challenging question, ""What is sorrowful rice?""
""Sorrowful rice, a well-known delicacy in Hong Kong, derives its name from the martial arts masterpiece The Return of the Condor Heroes by Hong Kong writer Jin Yong. In the novel, the character Yang Guo experiences deep sorrow after losing his beloved, Xiaolongnyu,"" Sensechat responded.
He was impressed — it was the first artificial intelligence tool he had encountered that exhibited a profound understanding of Cantonese culture.
Born in 1998, He is fond of Cantonese and has been creating videos promoting the language since college. Over the years, he has amassed a fan base that surpasses 700,000 across various online platforms, including YouTube and popular Chinese mainland social media platforms like Bilibili, Xiaohongshu, and Douyin. Due to the recent AI craze, He started producing videos evaluating the tools' ability to understand Cantonese.
The outcomes are underwhelming. Many AI large language models (LLMs) and AI software developed on the mainland fail to recognize Cantonese phonetically. Some Western-developed AI software can listen to Cantonese, but cannot speak it accurately. ChatGPT, for instance, often blends Cantonese with Mandarin. Suno, an AI large language model tool that specializes in generating songs, can pronounce Cantonese to a degree, but its primary focus remains music creation.
In July, the SenseTime Group, an AI developer based in Hong Kong, introduced SenseChat, a Cantonese version of its proprietary LLM, and announced that it would be available for free to Hong Kong users indefinitely.
Upon a friend's recommendation, He downloaded Sensechat.
""I felt 85 percent satisfied with Sense-Chat,"" he said. ""The application still requires to be further refined, but it is one of the few that can truly understand Cantonese.""
The application emphasizes one of the unique traits of Cantonese — its colloquial nature.
Pronunciation of Cantonese involves extensive use of modal particles, which are often used at the end of sentences to indicate mood. These particles usually go unnoticed by most AI tools, but Sensechat captures them effectively.
In terms of written text, Sensechat can understand and reflect the nuances between the two forms of written Cantonese. It has a standardized form used in formal situations, similar to Mandarin, and a phonetic style for everyday use. This characteristic, He said, is often overlooked by other large language models.
He recorded his interactions with Sensechat, and shared it online, garnering over 150,000 views. ""Cantonese speakers truly need such a tool,"" He said.
Data size matters
Training an LLM typically involves three stages, said Cao Jiannong, the chair professor in the Department of Computing at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
The first stage requires pre-training using extensive data, followed by fine-tuning with high-quality data. In the third stage, humans are needed to align the output of the LLM with local culture, ethics, morals, laws, and other rules to restrict the risk of generating inaccurate, biased, or unlawful content.
Developing a Cantonese LLM faces difficulties in all three stages, Cao said.
While Hong Kong's internet infrastructure is relatively well-developed, there is a scarcity of Cantonese content available online. A major factor contributing to this scarcity is that while Cantonese is widely spoken in daily life, the written form of Cantonese is Chinese.
Moreover, English has long served as the official language in Hong Kong. Consequently, a significant portion of the city's online information, including official archived documents in areas such as law, finance, politics, and medicine, is predominantly available in English, Cao said.
LLMs rely heavily on abundant data for their training, said Francis Fong Po-kiu, honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, a local IT-related business association. Without data, there is simply no way to develop a language model, he said.
Literature scarcity
Cantonese web resources suffer not only from a shortage in quantity, but also a lack of quality, said Cao.
When it comes to written material, Hong Kong has not prioritized literature, resulting in a scarcity of quality Cantonese literary works, said Keith Li King-wah, chairman of Hong Kong Wireless Technology Industry Association.
Most available Cantonese texts come from online forums and social media, and often contain low-quality and even offensive language, potentially leading AI models to produce crude content, Li said.
Collecting speech data presents another problem.
Despite access to Cantonese videos online, such as movies and TV dramas, they cannot be used due to background noise, said Albert Lam Yun-sang, the chief technology officer and chief scientist at Fano Labs, a Hong Kong-based startup focusing on speech and language technologies.
Besides insufficient data, Cantonese's intricate linguistic characteristics are another obstacle in training an AI model.
The Economist magazine analyzed language learning time, and found that mastering Cantonese requires 88 weeks of study, placing it alongside Mandarin, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean in the top five most difficult languages to learn.
Lu Lewei, director of the SenseTime Research Institute, said that Cantonese is highly colloquial with numerous inflections. It has nine tones and even a slight variation in pronunciation can alter a word's meaning.
The language also features a blend of Chinese and English and a mix of old and modern terms.
In language modeling, the simplicity of a language offers advantages. The more complex the language is, the harder for the AI model to learn about it, Lam said.
Furthermore, underlying Cantonese is the local culture, which can be challenging for those tasked with aligning the output of large language models, Cao said.
Urgent need
Despite the difficulties involved in creating Cantonese AI models, demand for them is undeniable, said Fong from the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation.
The global Cantonese-speaking population is nearly 120 million, and 85.2 million of those are native Cantonese speakers.
In Hong Kong, 6.3 million residents, or 88.2 percent of the city's population, use Cantonese as their spoken language. In other cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Cantonese is the predominant dialect, with 67 million residents in Guangdong province conversing in it.
In the future, AI will be akin to today's computers and fundamentally a tool for the general public. Without Cantonese AI tools, Cantonese-only speakers may encounter significant inconvenience and marginalization in both the offline and online world, Cao said.
For a city, lack of AI expertise could result in decreased productivity in sectors such as education, healthcare, finance, and law. These limitations could impede the whole city's development, Cao added.
Fong said AI models from other countries or regions may struggle to grasp Cantonese culture accurately. This could lead to cultural or political misinterpretations, resulting in the spreading of incorrect messages.
Dependence on outside AI models could make privacy and security vulnerable, Fong said.
Government officials, for instance, might face national security risks and local companies might leak data if they inadvertently disclose sensitive information to the models developed in foreign jurisdictions, he added.
Fong urged the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and local organizations to develop Cantonese LLMs.
In July, Sun Dong, Hong Kong's Secretary for Innovation, Technology, and Industry, announced that the SAR government is cooperating with local universities to develop a Hong Kong-based large language model.
A document co-pilot application for civil servants is now being used on a trial basis.
The model has already been implemented in Sun's department and the system will eventually become available to all Hong Kong residents, the secretary said.
The bureau said plans are underway to expand the pilot application to three other government bureaus, but it gave no indication when Hong Kong residents would gain access to it.
Fong said if it could be launched successfully, the government LLM would have many benefits.
It would be a positive step in resolving the issue of some Western AI models limiting their usage in Hong Kong. Also, implementing a localized AI model could safeguard privacy and provide more convenience to residents, Fong said.
Cao said it's unclear what specific features the government's AI model could offer and how it would distinguish itself from other similar products.
""I don't think the government has done enough research on what they want to do,"" Cao said.
Local startups
Local technology companies, meanwhile, are actively meeting the needs of the Cantonese-speaking market.
One startup, Votee AI, developed an opensource Cantonese LLM this year.
After years of operating in the local market, Votee AI has gathered substantial amounts of open-source Cantonese data along with primary data.
Taking a community-centered approach, they have also collaborated with local Cantonese linguists and AI researchers, including the team behind the online Cantonese dictionary ""words.hk"", to capture the nuances of Hong Kong speech.
SenseTime has also accumulated a vast reservoir of internal open-source data.
The company has synthesized data by leveraging advanced technologies and bought supplementary information from external channels to collect data.
To combat the shortage of high-quality Cantonese data, SenseTime also collected audio Cantonese data from hundreds of its local employees.
Sensechat's clients include customer service providers, financial institutions, legal firms, healthcare companies, and others.
For Hong Kong residents, the company promises to provide the service for free indefinitely for free on both the web version and mobile application.
A local tech industry insider, who chose to stay anonymous, said Sense-Chat should opensource its technology to allow more residents and organizations to access it freely, to benefit the city.
After trying the Sensechat platform, he said its understanding of some Hong Kong slang could be more precise. Nonetheless, ""it should be recognized that SenseChat filled a void in the local market,"" he said.
Cultural roots
In addition to developing local AI models, existing mainstream language models should be encouraged to improve their Cantonese functions, said Li from the Hong Kong Wireless Technology Industry Association.
However, mainstream AI language models are primarily developed by commercial entities in the West. Without market demand, they may not be willing to enhance their products' Cantonese capabilities.
Li believes the Hong Kong SAR government and local organizations should take the lead in collecting Cantonese data, digitize cultural content, and share these resources openly to enrich the Cantonese body of information.
Cantonese speakers can also actively use the language to engage with mainstream AI language models.
These actions can demonstrate to AI model developers that there is a market demand for Cantonese, while interaction with these models can also enhance their understanding of Cantonese culture.
The key to encouraging more people to use Cantonese lies in making Cantonese culture appealing, Li said.
Language is not just a communication tool; it encapsulates the cultural essence and identity of its speakers, he said.
The marginalized status of Cantonese in the digital sphere is a reflection of the decline of the cultural significance of the region.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Hong Kong, although just a city, was so culturally influential that Cantonese was a popular language around the world, Li said.
""At that time, the whole world watched Hong Kong movies and TVB (television shows), knew Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, and sang Cantonese songs. However, in the present day, even many students in Hong Kong cannot speak Cantonese,"" he said.
""The focus of government policies should not only be on technology, but also on culture.""
He, the influencer, said he learned Cantonese from his grandparents when he was a child, which later made him more proficient in the language than other school students. The confidence this gave him motivated him to become a Cantonese blogger.
However, as He aged, Cantonese became so marginalized that even voice-operated devices and software in his home failed to understand Cantonese commands.
While He could communicate with these devices in Mandarin and English, his grandparents, who only speak Cantonese, struggled to keep pace.
He hopes that Cantonese LLMs will one day help his elderly grandparents manage their daily lives through voice-controlled apps capable of understanding Cantonese.

"Chinese researchers develop ""lunar bricks"" for future lunar base construction",2024-10-21,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1021/c90000-20231521.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers develop ""lunar bricks"" for future lunar base construction
 (Xinhua) 08:27, October 21, 2024
BEIJING, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed bricks from a material that has a similar composition to lunar soil, with the hope that they can be used to build a lunar base in the future.
According to a recent video clip provided to Xinhua by the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), a team of researchers led by Ding Lieyun used a lunar soil simulant to make ""lunar bricks"" that are more than three times stronger than standard red bricks or concrete bricks.
The team also developed another construction option using additive manufacturing technology. The researchers invented a 3D-printing robot to print houses using lunar soil.
According to Zhou Cheng at HUST, the team used five different simulated lunar soil compositions and three different sintering processes, which can provide more accurate scientific data for the selection of materials and process optimization for future lunar base construction.
The composition of lunar soil varies in different locations on the moon, Zhou said, noting that there is one composition that simulates the lunar soil at the landing site of Chang'e-5, which is mainly basalt. Some other compositions simulate the soil found at other locations, soil that is mainly anorthosite.
He explained that the bricks need to undergo performance testing to determine if their mechanical performance will degrade in the lunar environment and whether they can withstand the high frequency of lunar quakes.
The moon has a vacuum environment with significant cosmic radiation, and temperatures exceed 180 degrees Celsius during the lunar day, dropping to minus 190 degrees Celsius at night. The team has to determine how well the bricks can insulate and if they can withstand the radiation, Zhou said.
According to China Central Television, the lunar bricks will be sent to China's space station aboard the Tianzhou-8 cargo spacecraft to verify their mechanical and thermal performance, as well as their ability to withstand cosmic radiation. The first lunar brick is expected to return to Earth by the end of 2025.
China unveiled a national mid-term to long-term development program for space science on Tuesday, outlining a roadmap for the development of space science in China through 2050. The international lunar research station, which was initiated by China, will be constructed during the program's second phase from 2028 to 2035.

The world's largest shield machine for railway construction, a tunneling device with a diameter of 15.4 meters, excavated its 1,000th ring segment on Sunday to reach 2 kilometers, a milestone in the construction of a tunnel beneath the Yangtze River for a high-speed railway.
The achievement also means that the shield machine, called Linghang, which was independently developed by China, is pressing ahead to a higher level of construction difficulty, according to China Railway Tunnel Group Co, constructor of what will be a 14.25-km underwater railway tunnel linking Shanghai's Chongming Island with Taicang, a city in Jiangsu province.
""With a gradual, slight downward slope, the pressure from the surrounding water on the construction project is escalating. Many parts of the tunnel to accommodate railway tracks in both directions are to be built at 89 meters underneath the river, where the water pressure is 0.9 megapascal — as enormous as holding six people on a fingernail,"" said Fu Bowei, the project's deputy chief engineer.
""Such gigantic water pressure places high demands on the performance of our equipment and technologies,"" Fu said, adding that the 128-meter-long shield machine began work in April.
High-speed trains are expected to run at a maximum speed of 350 km/h inside the tunnel — the world's highest speed in underwater tunnels — and outside the tunnel.
According to Shanghai's Jiefang Daily, the tunnel will be ready for the operation of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hefei high-speed railway by the end of 2029.
So far, tunnel construction has crossed the embankment on the north side of the Yangtze River and proceeded more than 1,100 meters into the riverbed, and the excavation environment has changed from soft soil to sandy formation.
""Moreover, hard cement is contained in the environment, which makes the shield cutter easy to wear during tunneling. The shield machine is equipped with a system to detect tool wear. Whenever wear is detected, we make corresponding adjustments,"" said Fu.
""Also, the construction is currently under a protection area for aquatic products, and we must optimize tunneling parameters, including those regarding slurry pressure, thrust and advancing speed, to make its operation adaptable to the environment,"" he said.
The entire tunneling project needs to cross nearly 20 risk sources, including the protection areas for aquatic products as well as docks and parks, said Fu.
Liu Jianping, deputy manager of the project, said eight smart construction systems, integrating technologies such as cloud computing and virtual and real integration, as well as artificial intelligence inspection, are being deployed.
These smart systems will be used in tunneling, assembly, prefabrication, transportation, ventilation, detection and management, and control.
The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hefei high-speed railway is the eastern section of the Shanghai-Chongqing-Chengdu high-speed route, and is an important part of the high-speed rail corridor along the Yangtze River in the nation's ""Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal"" rail network.
The project will create a fast new channel between a megacity cluster with Shanghai as the core as well as two city clusters centered on Nanjing and Hefei.
It is expected to further bring cities in the Yangtze River delta closer to one another, serving the coordinated development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and promoting the integrated development of the delta region.

Chinese scientists develop novel high-efficiency solar cell
 (Xinhua) 10:48, October 19, 2024
BEIJING, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- An international team led by scientists with the Institute of Chemistry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a new type of high-efficiency solar cell.
The perovskite-organic tandem solar cell can achieve a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 26.4 percent, the highest efficiency for such solar cells to date, according to Li Yongfang, an academician and a researcher at the institute.
Perovskite solar cells and organic solar cells represent the next generation of solar cells. Compared to the currently widely used crystalline silicon solar cells, they offer advantages such as ease of preparation, light weight and the ability to be fabricated into flexible devices.
These features present significant application prospects in areas such as portable energy, building-integrated photovoltaics and indoor photovoltaics.
The novel cell utilizes wide-bandgap perovskite materials to absorb short-wavelength sunlight and the narrow-bandgap organic active layer to absorb near-infrared long-wavelength sunlight, Li said.
He added that this combination significantly expands the usable solar spectrum and effectively enhances the energy conversion efficiency of the device.
The study was published in the journal Nature.

China launches its first digital resource center for Tibetan medicine, astrology
 (Xinhua) 10:47, October 19, 2024
LHASA, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region launched the country's first digital resource center for Tibetan medicine and astrology on Friday.
Established by the Hospital of Traditional Tibetan Medicine in the regional capital Lhasa, the center features 10 databases, including Tibetan medicine materials and the literature on Tibetan medicine and astrology. It also houses high-resolution scanned copies of rare Tibetan medical and astrology texts dating back to the 8th Century.
The digitization efforts began in 2006, with over 40 researchers working to collect and preserve valuable literature not only from Xizang but also from provincial-level regions such as Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia and Liaoning. The team also traveled internationally, securing documents from collections in Mongolia, the United States and France.
""It is a critical step forward in advancing academic collaboration and scientific research in Tibetan medicine and astrology. We aim to create an open, accessible platform offering high-quality data and services to the global academic community,"" said Tsering, director of the hospital.
Traditional Tibetan medicine emphasizes that seasonal changes affect the circulation of the body's organs. As a result, practitioners pay close attention to variations in celestial bodies.
Under Tibetan tradition, astronomical calculations and astrology are conducted at hospitals. Each year, the almanac is generated based on calculations made by scholars of the hospitals.

Scientists unveil new strategy for cardiac arrest resuscitation
 (Xinhua) 10:45, October 18, 2024
GUANGZHOU, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have developed a new method for cardiac arrest resuscitation, which is expected to improve the success rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and have a profound impact on the development of emergency care systems for critical conditions.
Cardiac arrest patients often experience severe brain damage, which is the primary cause of death. Animal studies have shown that within mere seconds of cardiac arrest, the brain's oxygen supply is depleted, leading to an immediate loss of consciousness.
Previous research suggested that the brain can only tolerate ischemic damage for five to eight minutes, which has contributed to the low resuscitation success rate for cardiac arrest patients.
An international research team led by He Xiaoshun from the first affiliated hospital, Sun Yat-sen University in south China's Guangdong Province, applied an innovative ""ex vivo brain preservation technique"" to successfully ""revive"" an isolated pig brain that had been ""dead"" for 50 minutes.
In detail, the study used a pig that had already experienced circulatory death as the experimental subject. After separating its brain from its body, the researchers connected the brain to an external life-support system through intubation, creating a system that supports brain resuscitation.
The results showed that the pig's brain was successfully ""revived,"" with brain functions restored and vitality maintained.
This system not only includes components for an artificial heart and artificial lungs but also utilizes normothermic blood perfusion technology to preserve a living pig liver, providing fresh, oxygenated and metabolically stable blood circulation to the isolated pig brain.
The study shows that with the support of the ex vivo life support system, the edema of the isolated brain was significantly reduced, and the vitality and microstructure of nerve cells were notably improved, allowing for the restoration and maintenance of electrical brain activity.
The study also highlights the crucial role of the liver in the pathogenesis of post-cardiac arrest brain injury.
The study was recently published as the cover article in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine.

NANCHANG, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have discovered a new type of dinosaur egg fossils in east China's Jiangxi Province, with one measuring just 29 mm in length, the smallest ever found globally.
Following a three-year study, the team comprising researchers from the Jiangxi Geological Survey and Exploration Institute (JGSEI), China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences confirmed the six egg fossils dating back to the Late Cretaceous period, over 80 million years ago, as dinosaur eggs.
The relatively complete, irregularly arranged egg fossils were found in a well-preserved nest at a construction site in Meilin Township in Ganxian District in the city of Ganzhou in 2021.
Using scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, the team of researchers analyzed the microstructure of the eggshells, and determined that their morphology and microstructure suggest they belong to a non-avian theropod, said Lou Fasheng, chief engineer at the JGSEI.
The most complete egg has a maximum length of only 29 mm, setting a new record for the smallest dinosaur egg fossil, Lou said. The previously known smallest dinosaur egg fossil was found in China's Zhejiang Province, measuring approximately 45.5 mm X 40.4 mm X 34.4 mm in dimensions.
This latest discovery expands the diversity of dinosaur eggs from the Late Cretaceous and offers valuable insights into the evolution of theropods during that period, according to Lou.
The findings were published online on Monday in the journal Historical Biology.
Lou said the research team will use micro-CT scanning to reconstruct the burial state of the egg fossils, study their formation process and further pinpoint the dinosaur type that laid these eggs as well as the reproductive methods of the species.

Multiple sources told China Daily that Tesla Inc has yet to receive regulatory approval from Chinese authorities to launch its full self-driving or FSD functions in the country and is seeking permission to gather some data on its own to train its autonomous driving system.
The United States vehicle maker announced last month on the social platform that it expected to launch FSD in China in the first quarter of 2025.""The rollout progress is not expected to mirror the speed as the company itself planned,"" several sources close to the matter confirmed.
They said that the proposal is still pending from various Chinese authorities to evaluate in an all-round way, including technology, data safety, laws and regulations, as well as other relevant standards.
Though no official green light has been given as of now, the Chinese government will partially support its trial test of FSD functions in some cities, the sources day.
As data security has been a key obstacle to a full rollout of FSD, two people close to Tesla said that Musk has proposed directly accessing some non-sensitive video data to train its autonomous driving system.
He also proactively suggested that a dedicated government team could thoroughly assess this video data to ensure its security, one of the sources said.
Other people acknowledged the matter and said that Chinese authorities didn't give an immediate response to this request given the current rules and regulations.
According to the regulations of the Ministry of Natural Resources, automakers and developers of autonomous driving software should either apply for mapping licenses or ask a licensed company to collect, store, transform, and process geographic data.
Currently, foreign firms lack the qualifications to independently gather geographic data and must partner with local entities.
To comply, Tesla has stored all data collected by its Chinese vehicles in China since 2021 and is cooperating with local companies to collect data to support its driver assistant system.

Chinese scientists develop technology for sustainable production of industrial chemicals,2024-10-17,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1017/c90000-20230829.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists develop technology for sustainable production of industrial chemicals
 (Xinhua) 16:11, October 17, 2024
BEIJING, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a technology for sustainable production of bio-based ethylene glycol (EG), an important bulk energy chemical, with a production capacity of 1,000 tonnes annually, marking a significant step in the green transformation of China's chemical industry chain.
This breakthrough will also support China's sustainable economic development and the realization of the nation's ""dual carbon"" goal, which refers to peaking its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, according to Zheng Mingyuan, a researcher with the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
A research team from DICP and SinoSci Bio-EG (Zhengzhou) New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. successfully completed pilot testing of the biomass-to-bio-EG catalytic conversion technology at a scale of 1,000 tonnes annually, which passed evaluation by the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation on Thursday.
EG, mainly used in the synthesis of polyester fibers, polyester bottles, antifreeze, coatings and pharmaceuticals, has an annual global consumption of over 30 million tonnes. China is a major producer and consumer of EG, with an annual consumption exceeding 20 million tonnes.
However, EG is primarily produced from petroleum or coal, which has disadvantages such as reliance on non-renewable resources, high carbon dioxide emissions, and high energy consumption. Therefore, the development of green and efficient EG production technologies is urgently needed, Zheng noted.
In 2008, the research team led by Zhang Tao, an academician at the CAS, pioneered the direct catalytic conversion of cellulose into EG at DICP, establishing a novel pathway for producing bio-based EG.
In the subsequent years, the team conducted systematic research focusing on fundamental understanding and industrial applications. They achieved significant progress in developing low-cost catalysts, investigating reaction mechanisms, converting raw materials and creating high-efficiency reaction systems.
In 2022, the team of researchers, in collaboration with SinoSci Bio-EG and other partners, built the world's first pilot facility for 1,000-tonne bio-EG production through catalysis in Puyang in central China's Henan Province. The team later carried out technological improvements for the project.
Zheng explained that the pilot facility employs the biomass feedstock of sugars derived from starch and corn stalks to produce EG through a highly selective catalytic reaction system, combined with an efficient product separation process. The entire process follows a green, low-carbon route.
With over 40 authorized invention patents, this technology boasts a comprehensive portfolio of independent intellectual property rights, according to Zheng.
The pilot operation has laid the foundation for the industrial application of the technology at a scale of 10,000 tonnes annually, Zheng said.
