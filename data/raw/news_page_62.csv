TOKYO, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's lunar probe has re-entered a dormant state and suspended activities as it reached sunset, rendering solar power generation unavailable, the country's space agency said on Thursday.
The planned activities for the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM), which made Japan the world's fifth lunar landing country, concluded on Wednesday, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said.
The JAXA said it is expected to make operational attempts again in mid-February when sunlight reaches the solar panels, admitting the uncertainty whether SLIM, designed to withstand extremely cold conditions, will restart.
SLIM, dubbed the ""moon sniper,"" landed on the moon at 12:20 a.m. local time (0320 GMT) on Jan. 20, and was later confirmed to have achieved a pinpoint landing with an unprecedented precision of less than 100 meters from intended targets, as opposed to conventional landers that often have an accuracy of within several kilometers, according to the JAXA.
As its solar cells were not generating electricity, the lander, some 2.4 meters tall and weighing about 200 kg excluding fuel, was switched off at 2:57 a.m. on Jan. 22 after working on backup batteries, but it restored power and started functioning on Monday.
The rocket carrying SLIM was launched on Sept. 7 from the Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan, in the country's third attempt at a lunar landing.

Futuristic scene of robots taking over backbreaking farm jobs on horizon,2024-02-01,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0201/c90000-20129556.html,"Home>>
		
Futuristic scene of robots taking over backbreaking farm jobs on horizon
 (Xinhua) 11:26, February 01, 2024
SHANGHAI, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The image of a farmer pulling a field-ploughing buffalo is usually conjured up when thinking of the physically-taxing farm work.
With that picture in mind, one would startle at the scene of remote-control-holding engineers ""herding"" robotic ""cattle,"" in a farmland situated in the outskirt of Shanghai.
The futuristic scene was created by over 70 engineers who have, over the past seven years or so, buried themselves in research and development of farming robots in Tinglin Township's Diantian Farm in Shanghai. These engineers are employed at the high-tech company, Shanghai Sweet AI Technology.
The iron-and-steel ""cattle"" they maneuvered with remote controls, equipped with tracks as ""legs and hooves"", are AI-enabled robots capable of various farm works, including ploughing and harvesting. Engineers in the Diantian Farm have so far built more than 60 types of these farm robots.
Farmers can simply log on to a WeChat app account with their mobile phones and adjust directions using an app interface, which activates the robots.
""Agricultural robots are marked by rapid moves, accuracy and tirelessness,"" said Wang Jinyue, CEO of Shanghai Sweet AI Technology.
Enabled by 5G, image recognition technology and big data systems, a picking robot can instantly ""calculate"" its distance from the targeted fruit and convey the instructions to the robot arms, Wang gave an example of how farm robots work.
Weeding robots, for instance, can accurately distinguish weeds from crops, and snip out weeds while leaving crops untouched. A weeding robot works incessantly for eight hours following one hour of charging, and large-size robots can weed 500 mu (33.3 hectares) of land a day.
Wang even recalled his experience of doing excruciating farm jobs. ""I grew up in the countryside, however, strong as I am, I was not as efficient as the elders in farm work, and half-day farm jobs left my hands covered with blisters.""
Wang said the experience motivated him to delve into the development of agricultural machinery.
The scene in the Shanghai suburb is being played out in other fields in the country as well. In Hanzhong, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, a group of engineers are applying smart technology to vegetable planting.
In a smart green house operated by the Shaanxi Riliguanghe Biotechnology Co., Ltd, after the land is prepared by the automated rotary tiller, the automated planter lays a board dotted with drilled holes on the ground, and it places the seeds in the holes with superb precision.
A vegetable farm measuring 200 mu is attended by five workers only, as long-distance maneuvering and long-distance monitoring have made the unmanned planting of vegetables possible.
""There are few people now willing to stay in the agricultural sector,"" said Guo Qiang, general manager of the Shaanxi Riliguanghe Biotechnology Co., Ltd., attributing the labor shortage to the tedious farm jobs and modest returns.
""The digitalized farming practices are expected to entice more youngsters to return to farm jobs and settle in their hometowns, bringing new vigor to the rural revitalization drive,"" said Guo.

"Chinese scientists mull building ""cell factory"" of blue-green algae",2024-01-31,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0131/c90000-20129246.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists mull building ""cell factory"" of blue-green algae
 (Xinhua) 16:31, January 31, 2024
SHANGHAI, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are considering building a biological ""cell factory"" of blue-green algae, in which air is the main raw material and the product is a range of organic compounds.
These cells of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, a kind of single-cell microorganism, have been modified using synthetic biotechnologies like gene editing. Featuring high reproduction speed and excellent efficiency of photosynthesis, they ""eat"" air and can produce organic compounds like glucose, sucrose, glycerol, resveratrol, and curcumin, among others.
Stepping into a laboratory at the School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology under the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, dense bottles and tubes with green liquid can be seen arranged in rows. They are filled with blue-green algae cells.
""Theoretically, this kind of algae has the potential to produce all the substances that plants can produce in nature,"" said Ni Jun, the lab owner and a researcher at the university.
For decades, cell factories using modified bacteria and yeast have been widely used in medicine, the chemical industry and agriculture, said Ni. Among other substances, they have been used to produce recombinant human insulin using Escherichia coli.
However, the high cost of raw materials, such as glucose, has limited the development of such cell factories to some extent. In pondering this problem, Ni wondered whether a solution might be found in using photosynthesis to produce compounds. He eventually opted for blue-green algae, which can express most plant-derived genes and can be easily modified due to its small genome size.
In 2015, for the first time, his team produced a series of high value-added natural products using engineered blue-green algae, shedding light on the promising prospects of light-driven biosynthesis.
The process of modifying these algae cells is not complicated. To produce a target compound, the first step is to analyze its synthesis process in plants, and then introduce each gene essential to this process into the algae cells. ""Eventually, we regulate the expression level of each gene to improve its synthesis efficiency in blue-green algae cells as much as possible,"" Ni said. The findings were published in the international journal Green Chemistry in 2016.
As explained in the findings, the modification process can be simply summarized as using ""scissors"" to cut out relevant gene fragments in plants and inserting them into the gene sequence of cyanobacteria cells, which were thus given the ability to synthesize the target substances.
Ni has high hopes for the application of this technology in industrial production. He cites resveratrol, a common component in anti-aging skin care products, as an example. Resveratrol can be sourced from grapes and peanuts, but producing it using blue-green algae can shorten the production cycle by 240 times for each tonne of product, while reducing costs by 50 to 70 percent.
However, blue-green algae cannot produce every type of organic compound, nor can it produce some compounds more efficiently than other microorganisms. Ni has been exploring whether it was possible for this algae to work in combination with other organisms, with the former acting as an energy and organic carbon supplier, absorbing carbon dioxide in the air.
This ambitious idea turned into reality last year. His team made a breakthrough in combining cyanobacteria with various industrial bacteria. In that case, the former produces energy substances such as sugar for the latter, which further produces a wider variety of target products.
The study findings were published as a cover story in the renowned German academic journal Angewandte Chemie in January 2023. As the magazine illustrated, cyanobacteria and industrial bacteria were compared to two birds working in collaboration, one looking for tree branches outside and the other building their nest inside.
In Ni's lab, rows of glass bottles and tubes, surrounded by simulated sunlight, are shaken by machines to speed up the gas exchange inside. They are filled with green liquid of various shades, each representing a group of engineered blue-green algae cells capable of producing a different kind of target compound.
Through technology transfer, part of the team's research results have entered industrial production. At present, a production line with an annual capacity of 10 tonnes of high-value-added products is under construction, Ni said.

NANCHANG, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese paleontologists have discovered dinosaur fossil bones dating back 90 million years to the Cretaceous period, believed to be a new species that was later named ""Gandititan cavocaudatus.""
These bones were found at a construction site in Ganxian District in the city of Ganzhou, east China's Jiangxi Province, in June 2021, said Wang Lingyun, deputy curator of the Jiangxi Geological Museum.
The museum, together with the China University of Geosciences (CUG) (Wuhan) and Jiangxi Geological Survey and Exploration Institute, jointly started conducting restoration and research work later the same year.
The species, a new titanosaurian sauropod, belongs to a giant type of dinosaur called Titanosauria, said Han Fenglu, team leader of the project from CUG (Wuhan) in central China's Hubei Province.
The discovered bones in total account for about 40 percent of a dinosaur's skeleton, which is rare in the world for their integrity and delicacy, said Han.
Among the bones are six articulated cervical vertebrae, two partial dorsal vertebrae, and a complete sacrum preserved in articulation with the first 17 caudal vertebrae and part of the right pelvis.
The well-preserved vertebral column allows an accurate estimation of a total body length of 14 meters, which is relatively small among sauropods, according to Han.
The discovery, published in the latest Journal of Systematic Palaeontology on Jan. 17, is of great significance for studying the evolution and paleogeographic distribution of the species in the Cretaceous period.

Carbon-14 medical isotope developed and designed by Nuclear Power Institute of China under CNNC Photo: Courtesy of CNNC
The construction of the world's most powerful solution-type medical isotope test reactor commenced on Tuesday in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, according to information obtained by the Global Times from the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). This development aims to better address the diagnostic and treatment requirements of tens of millions of people in China.
After becoming operational, this reactor, constructed by the Nuclear Power Institute of China under CNNC, is projected to have an annual production capacity of 100,000 curies of molybdenum-99 and 20,000 curies of iodine-131. This will address the longstanding reliance on imports and the bottleneck issue concerning these two isotopes.
Furthermore, this development is expected to catalyze the downstream industry, generating an output value of more than 4 billion yuan ($0.56 billion), thereby significantly enhancing cancer diagnosis and treatment capabilities in China.
Medical isotopes are typical radioactive isotopes that have been successfully employed in the field of medicine. Carbon-14, a mainstream medical isotope, is utilized in breath tests to detect Helicobacter pylori during routine physical examinations.
Zhao Guang, the director of the medical isotope department at the Nuclear Power Institute of China, told the Global Times that dozens of medical isotopes, such as carbon-14, iodine-131, iodine-125, and strontium-89, are highly sought-after in the detection and treatment of major diseases. However, China has traditionally depended heavily on imports for its supply of medical isotopes.
A research report from the Nuclear Power Institute of China indicates that in recent years, China has depended on imports for more than 90 percent of medical isotopes produced through nuclear reactors, with a limited variety. Meanwhile, there is a gradual increase in domestic demand for medical isotopes.
""At present, the development of medical isotopes in China mainly relies on research reactors. However, these reactors are also allocated for other tasks, severely limiting their capacity for medical isotope production. With the market demand for domestic medical isotopes and their compounds expanding at a rate of 25 to 30 percent annually, the existing reactor capacity falls significantly short of meeting the consistently increasing market needs,"" said Yao Gang, the head of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, in an interview with the Global Times.
He emphasized that the imbalance between supply and demand not only significantly impedes the progress of nuclear medicine in China but also poses a threat to the lives and health of the public.
In 2009, the world's largest supplier of carbon-14, Canada's National Research Universal reactor, ceased production, leading to the discontinuation of China's carbon-14 supply. Wang Conglin, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, told the Global Times that Western countries, including Canada, maintain a monopoly in medical isotope production, and the majority of China's medical isotopes are dependent on imports.
Due to the limited domestic development of the medical isotope industry, there exists a significant gap between the level of nuclear medicine in China and that in developed countries, Wang noted.
Simultaneously, depending on foreign procurement has consistently encountered issues of high prices and uncertain timely supply. Additionally, the international market is confronting supply challenges. The aforementioned research report indicates that in recent years, the global supply of medical isotopes has relied on a few research reactors in countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, South Africa, and Australia, most of which have exceeded their service life and are grappling with issues like high maintenance costs, challenging waste disposal, and safety risks. It is anticipated that they will be gradually decommissioned around 2025.

""After the medical isotope test reactor is completed, it will attain an annual production capacity of 100,000 curies of molybdenum-99 and 20,000 curies of iodine-131, surpassing the current domestic demand,"" Li Qing, the chief designer of the reactor, told the Global Times.
Li further explained that the construction cost of the medical isotope test reactor is only one-third of that of a regular nuclear reactor, and the fuel consumption is merely 0.4 percent of the existing technology.
Zhang Jinsong, the technical director of medical isotope R&D at the Nuclear Power Institute of China, told the Global Times that the isotope reactor is expected to be completed and operational by 2027. Upon completion, it is poised to make a significant leap in the production capacity of the two most commonly used medical isotopes, iodine-131 and molybdenum-99, transforming China from an importing country to an exporting country.
It will also reduce the prices of domestic medical isotope drugs, making them more accessible and affordable for more people, according to Zhang.

Attacks from the US are the most advanced as they can control networks around the world automatically and systemically to obtain key data for military and political use, according to the report.The number of cyberattacks on overseas Chinese institutions and enterprises also increased significantly last year, the report said.China must attach greater importance to cybersecurity issues in those institutions and enterprises because they also hold key information on government policy and trade data, which matter to China's core interests, it added.In addition, there has been an obvious increase in the number of cyberattacks launched to obtain geological surveying and mapping data in China, which can be used by political forces to make strategic decisions, the report said.Last July, 360 reported a cyberattack from the US on Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center in Hubei province. Once its high-precision geological surveying and mapping data was leaked, it could be used to locate key energy and military targets, so the consequences of such an attack can be severe, it said.More than 50 percent of the attacks detected last year by the company were in the education and scientific research sectors, which have become the key battlefields for China to combat cyberattacks.In some cases, the attackers even used documents and contact information they stole in order to launch precise attacks on targets, the report said.It added that besides the education sector, government organizations and the scientific research, national defense and transport sectors have also been targeted by APT organizations.

China’s most powerful spectral telescope with an aperture of 4.4 meters which can realize multi-target and high-resolution spectral observation simultaneously is expected to be completed and enter use in 2026 at the Lenghu Astronomical Observation Base, the largest astronomical observation base in Asia.
According to the Lenghu Astronomical Observation Base located in Northwest China’s Qinghai Province, Shanghai Jiao Tong University plans to build a large-aperture multi-functional spectral telescope, Jiaotong University Spectroscopic Telescope (JUST), at the base.
After three years of monitoring and testing conducted by the research team, the location of JUST at the Lenghu Astronomical Observation Base in Lenghu area on Saishiteng Mountain in Qinghai was found to enjoy advantages including good air quality, clear night skies, and other stable atmospheric conditions for constructing the world’s first-class large-scale observation base for optical and infrared astronomy.
So far, a total of 12 telescope projects from 11 scientific research institutes have been launched at the base. After their completion, the base will become Asia’s largest astronomical observation base.
With an aperture of 4.4 meters, the spectral telescope project adopted a lightweight design and is equipped with multiple spectrometers, allowing for rapid switching of target sources and timely spectroscopic observations.
According to the plan, JUST is expected to be completed and put into use in 2026, and carry out research work covering three aspects including exploring the dark universe, tracking the dynamic universe and searching for exoplanets as planned. After the project is completed, it is expected to achieve a series of breakthrough research results with significant impact in the fields of time-domain astronomy, exoplanet search, and cosmic web structure and evolution.
The JUST project is one of the major projects in the astronomical field strategically planned by the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The JUST site will be located near the Lenghu Town on the Saishiteng Mountain in Qinghai.
The JUST will be installed at the point B at an altitude of 4,322 meters above sea level on the Saishiteng Mountain. The current largest dome at the point C at an altitude of 4,200 meters, is the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) Mozi for time-domain surveys.
After it is completed, the JUST is expected to carry out characteristic spectral observations around scientific goals such as cosmic web structure, multi-messenger astronomy, and exoplanet exploration. By that time, the JUST will be the most powerful spectral telescope in China and will work closely with the survey telescope Mozi and the upcoming space-survey telescope, Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), to provide indispensable first-hand observation data for the further development of astronomy in China.
JUST’s high-resolution spectrometers will realize multi-target and high-resolution spectral observation simultaneously for the first time in the world, expected to greatly improve the efficiency of exoplanet detection.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Elon Musk said on Monday that his neurotech startup Neuralink implanted its device in a human for the first time on Sunday.
The patient is ""recovering well,"" Musk said on X, formerly Twitter. ""Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.""
Neuralink's first product is called Telepathy, he said.
The company is developing a brain implant that aims to help patients with severe paralysis control external technologies using only neural signals.
""Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. That is the goal,"" Musk wrote in a separate post.
Neuralink began recruiting patients for its first-in-human clinical trial in the autumn of last year after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the company to conduct the study in May.

China's AIMS telescope achieves breakthrough in measuring solar magnetic field
 (Xinhua) 11:03, January 30, 2024
XINING, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- The world's first solar magnetic-field telescope working in the mid-infrared wavelength has achieved a breakthrough by improving its measurement accuracy, according to Chinese scientists.
The telescope, known as the Accurate Infrared Magnetic Field Measurements of the Sun (AIMS), is a major project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. It is located in the Lenghu township in northwest China's Qinghai Province, at an average altitude of about 4,000 meters.
Scientific data shows that the AIMS telescope has carried out precise measurements of solar vector magnetic fields for the first time with an accuracy exceeding the 10 Gauss level, said Wang Dongguang, chief engineer of Huairou Solar Observing Station of National Astronomical Observatories, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
""This means that the telescope has achieved the expected goal of directly measuring the solar magnetic field intensity in the mid-infrared band using a super narrow-band Fourier spectrometer,"" Wang said.
Wang added that this achievement has broken through the bottleneck problem in the century-long history of solar magnetic field measurements by achieving a leap from indirect to direct measurement.
The AIMS telescope is the world's first device dedicated to observing the mid-infrared solar magnetic field and it aims to reveal the mysteries of the Sun in the mid-infrared band.
""Through optical design to eliminate stray light and technologies such as vacuum cooling, we have solved the challenges faced by infrared solar observations in this band, such as high environmental background noise and detector performance degradation,"" said Feng Zhiwei, a senior engineer at National Astronomical Observatories.
Feng added that the infrared imaging terminal of the telescope consists of three systems, namely, infrared optics, focal plane array detector and vacuum cooling, and all components, including the detector chip, are domestically made.
In addition to its role in the measurement of solar magnetic fields, the AIMS telescope can also explore new scientific avenues in the middle-infrared band, according to Wang.

Scientists restore kids' hearing with gene therapy: study
 (Xinhua) 16:09, January 29, 2024
SHANGHAI, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Using an experimental gene therapy, a team led by Chinese scientists has recovered the hearing of five children born with a genetic defect that had left them profoundly deaf.
In a first-in-human clinical trial, they demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy in treating patients with hereditary deafness, which afflicts up to 26 million people worldwide.
The researchers from the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University developed the gene drug RRG-003 by mounting a human OTOF transgene on adeno-associated virus.
Then, they enrolled six eligible children with the autosomal recessive deafness 9. The deafness is caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene that is known for resulting in the failure to properly transmit sound stimulation signals from the ear to the brain.
After they administered the medicine into the patient's inner ear with a single injection, five participants showed significant recovery of auditory and speech functions, according to the study recently published in the journal Lancet.
The average auditory brainstem response threshold improved from greater than 95 dB at baseline to as low as 38 dB in one participant by the 26-week mark. Speech perception was then restored in participants who experienced hearing recovery.
The gene therapy is shown to be safe and efficacious as a novel treatment for children with autosomal recessive deafness 9, said the researchers.
Individuals from Southeast University in China and Harvard Medical School in the United States collaborated in the study.

The world's first cloned endangered Xizang cattle species have been born, the local government in the Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region confirmed in a WeChat post on Monday.
Recently, endangered cattle breeds Zhangmu cattle and Apeijiaza cattle, found on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, have been successfully bred artificially using somatic cell cloning technology.
Yu Dawei, a researcher from the Beijing institute of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that researchers collected the ear tissue of Zhangmu cattle and Apeijiaza cattle, established a fibroblast cell line after returning to the laboratory, and then used somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to prepare clones embryos.
The cloned embryos were transplanted into surrogate cows, and after full-term pregnancy, we obtained eight cloned cows, Yu said.
Zhangmu cattle and Apeijiaza cattle are native to the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and are on the verge of extinction.
In 2022, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the National Animal Husbandry Station, and relevant Xizang departments urgently launched a rescue and protection operation for Zhangmu cattle and Apeijiaza cattle, collected blood samples of the two types of cattle, and completed whole-genome resequencing data collection, and finally achieved the rescue and protection of endangered cattle breeds in Xizang through somatic cell conservation, cloned embryo restoration and other technologies.
Looking ahead, authorities will carry out cloned embryo transplantation of Zhangmu cattle and Apeijiaza cattle in Xizang, combining cloning technology with conventional breeding technology to build a complete genetic system and improve resource protection and utilization system.
