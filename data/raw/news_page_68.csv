China will develop a batch of advanced emergency robots by 2025, which can partially or completely replace human work in future disaster prevention, mitigation, and relief, said the country's emergency and information technology authorities.
The aim is to greatly improve the robots' scientific, professional, refined, and intelligent capabilities and establish a number of bases where the robots can be trialed and put into use, according to the guideline on accelerating the development of emergency robotics, which was jointly released by Ministry of Emergency Management and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Thursday.
The guideline required emergency robots to be able to perform tasks such as monitoring and warning, search and rescue, communication and command, logistical support, and production operations, saying such robots can enhance the efficiency and safety of production and rescue in complex and hazardous scenarios.
The two ministries emphasized robot development in scenarios of flood rescue, forest and grassland fire rescue, earthquake and geological disaster relief, urban firefighting, emergency command communication, and workplace safety, promoting the mode where robots can replace humans in large-scale disasters rescue.
The document pointed out technological difficulties which were urgently needed to be broken through, such as the robots' ability to withstand harsh environments of high temperatures, high humidity, high altitudes, extreme cold, corrosion, complex underwater conditions, as well as adverse weather conditions of strong rain, snow, and winds.
According to the Ministry of Emergency Management, the natural disasters in the first three quarters of 2023 affected more than 89 million people in China, with 499 deaths or missing due to these disasters and caused direct economic losses of more than 308 billion yuan ($43 billion).

Country achieves crucial technological breakthroughs
 (China Daily) 08:58, January 05, 2024
Companies eager to cash in on AI to boost global competitiveness
Yu Zhongyuan, a 59-year-old businessman engaged in foreign trade in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, is a loyal user of Huawei Technologies Co's smartphones.
But he never expected the company's phone business to spring back to life so quickly.
After being subject to technology restrictions imposed by the United States government for four years, Huawei made a high-profile comeback to the 5G smartphone arena last year.
The company surprised the world with its Mate 60 series of smartphones, which are equipped with chips that support 5G technology. The phones made headlines worldwide and triggered an enthusiastic response from Chinese consumers.
Yu said: ""Having witnessed Huawei emerge stronger from mounting challenges, I am confident that China's technology industry can overcome any future difficulties. This is a symbolic moment.""
The recovery in Huawei's smartphone business offers an insight into how China's innovation-driven economy is scrambling to achieve breakthroughs in crucial technologies through long-term input into research and development, and by using a robust industrial support system.
Officials, company executives and experts said that despite geopolitical uncertainties and lackluster global demand, Chinese companies are eager to ride the latest technological wave, which includes artificial intelligence, or AI, to sharpen their global competitiveness and strengthen the security of key industrial chains.
The past year has seen innovation helping to set milestones in China's manufacturing industry.
The first commercial flight of the C919, China's self-developed large passenger aircraft, took off last year. The nation's first domestically produced large cruise ship, Adora Magic City, was delivered, and China surpassed Japan to become the world's largest exporter of automobiles.
Meanwhile, with AI set to unleash enormous potential in reshaping the world, Chinese companies are coming up with new applications to rival ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by the US company OpenAI, which has taken the world by storm. Such progress was made despite Washington's restrictions on exports of high-end AI chips to Beijing, the officials, company executives and experts said.
Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said, ""Some countries attempted to contain China's economic development by promoting decoupling, but our progress proved that their efforts have failed.""
China boasts the world's most complete industrial system, and its highly efficient industrial clusters, with close upstream and downstream connections, make Chinese companies extremely competitive on the global stage, Wei said.
""Meanwhile, China's development in high-tech sectors has promoted development of its digital economy. The nation is now closely intertwined with other countries in high-tech industries,"" said Wei, who is also vice-chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.
Data from the World Intellectual Property Organization show that China is now home to 24 of the world's top 100 science and technology innovation clusters, making it the country with the most such clusters.
Â 
Progress made
Huang Hanquan, head of the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, said China has made progress in key technologies in strategically important sectors, showing that scientific innovation plays an increasingly bigger role in driving economic growth. The academy is part of the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC.
As the innovation-driven development strategy gains traction, technological innovation continues to empower the real economy and new industries, and driving forces continue to develop and grow, Huang said.
Denis Depoux, global managing director of consultancy Roland Berger, said: ""China has demonstrated its innovation capability. It is leapfrogging in several fields, gaining leadership globally in areas like the electric vehicle chain â from batteries to charging infrastructure, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, nuclear and telecommunications equipment.""
The nation's industrial modernization, huge consumption potential, and growing innovation prowess are three strong points that create a new China story for the world, he added.
Last month, the tone-setting Central Economic Work Conference made the construction of a modern industrial system through technological innovation the top priority for economic work this year.
The conference called for efforts to develop new productivity boosters, and produce new industries, models and impetus with cutting-edge technologies.
Chen Zhichao, an assistant researcher at the Xi Jinping Thought on Economy Study Center, which is part of the NDRC, said the call will inject strong impetus into the country's high-quality economic development.
Compared with traditional productivity tools driven by elements such as labor, land and capital, Chen said new productivity boosters are led by technological innovation, which will promote the transformation of the economic growth mode.
""Challenges still exist, and more efforts, including higher fiscal investment and stimulation of social capital, are needed to increase investment in fundamental and applied research, and cultivate high-end innovation-oriented talent,"" Chen added.
Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology, the country's top industry regulator, said China will step up the development of a number of strategic emerging industries such as biomanufacturing, commercial aerospace, and the low-altitude economy.
The ministry will also open up new paths for future industries such as quantum and life sciences, and make extensive use of digital intelligence and green technologies to accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, Jin said.
""Technologies such as AI can empower China's new industrialization push, and their applications in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare will be an important symbol of a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation,"" he added.
Goldman Sachs Research forecast in a report that breakthroughs in generative AI, represented by applications such as ChatGPT, can drive a 7 percent, or almost $7 trillion, increase in global GDP and raise productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.
Well aware of the opportunities ahead, established tech heavyweights such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, ByteDance and Huawei, as well as thousands of startups in China, are scrambling to develop and embrace large language models. Such models are computer algorithms fed with huge amounts of data, which are key to supporting ChatGPT-like applications.
A report, released by the Beijing Municipal Science &Technology Commission, said that as of October, China had developed at least 254 AI large language models.
Chi Xiannian, a senior engineer at the China Center for Information Industry Development, a think tank affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said finance, manufacturing, governance and transportation are the top industries in China to use AI large language models.
Â 
Vital impact
Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlytek, a Chinese AI pioneer, said: ""Chinese companies must devote big, real money to research and development of fundamental science to achieve breakthroughs in AI. The impact of this generative AI technology is no less important than that of the birth of the PC or the internet.""
In October, iFlytek unveiled the latest version of its AI large language model, Spark-Desk V3.0. A test and evaluation report by the Guoyan Institute of Economic Research, which is affiliated with the Development Research Center of the State Council, said Spark-Desk V3.0 has an overall capability stronger than that of ChatGPT.
The model's core capability is evaluated in seven dimensions â text generation, language understanding, Q&A knowledge, logical reasoning, mathematic ability, coding ability, and multimodal ability, Liu said.
The ongoing AI boom is also spurring surging demand for AI chips, which are vital to enabling ChatGPT-like applications. Experts said Washington's restrictions on exports of US company Nvidia's advanced AI chips to Beijing last year have left plenty of room for competitive Chinese rivals to emerge.
For example, Huawei has launched its 910B AI chips, which have already been bought by major Chinese internet companies to support their large language models. The performance of Huawei's AI processor Ascend 910B can be roughly compared with that of Nvidia's A100 chip, iFlytek said.
Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said recently that Huawei is among a field of ""very formidable"" competitors to Nvidia in the race to produce the best AI chips.
Wei Shaojun, president of the integrated circuit design branch of the China Semiconductor Industry Association, said, ""This is the latest evidence that Washington's restrictions hurt the interests of US companies hard and accelerated Chinese companies' efforts to make technological breakthroughs.""
In addition to AI and chips, China also recorded rapid growth last year in the production of new energy vehicles, or NEVs.
In the first quarter of last year, China replaced Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers estimates that the nation's total vehicle exports for last year will exceed 5 million, a record high.
Xu Haidong, the association's deputy chief engineer, said, ""Chinese automobile brands have accurately grasped the emerging opportunities in NEVs, and the trend of integration with intelligence and connectivity.""
A report from consultancy KPMG said Chinese carmakers are expected to capture about 15 percent of Europe's electric vehicle market by next year, as established players such as BYD and emerging companies, including NIO and Li Auto, gain popularity among European consumers.
This would mark a big step forward, as Chinese marques accounted for less than 10 percent of the 1.1 million battery-powered electric vehicles sold in Europe in 2022, KPMG said.

Kevin Kang, chief economist at KPMG China, said, ""Chinese brands have huge potential in the European market and could contribute the most to future sales increases there.""
Ding Yuqian, head of China Autos Research at HSBC, said China has the world's most competitive electric vehicle battery supply chain.
The single most expensive item for such a vehicle is its battery, and carmakers based in China have access to high-quality batteries produced at a relative cost advantage, with manufacturers continuing to improve this technology.
Hans-Paul Burkner, global chair emeritus of Boston Consulting Group, said electric cars are a typical example of China moving up in the value chain. Chinese companies have become highly competitive, not just because of costs, but also due to quality and innovation, he added.
""When I look at some of the new cars on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai, the electric vehicles are really impressive. This is what makes Chinese companies competitive,"" Burkner said.
""We see quite a lot of Chinese companies being the top producers of patents and really good products, which are witnessed all over the world.""
Jeffrey Sachs, a renowned economist and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in New York, said, ""China's strength right now is that it is at the cutting edge of many of the most important technology innovations for the future.
""These include low-carbon energy solutions, electric vehicles, batteries, supply chains, artificial intelligence, high-speed trains, and many other sectors. All of these will be very good for China's future growth.""

Excessive nitrogen fertilizer yields less attractive apples: research
 (Xinhua) 16:50, January 04, 2024
JINAN, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Waxiness significantly influences the luster of apples, and recent research by Chinese scientists has revealed the regulatory mechanism of nitrogen on the cuticular wax of apples. The findings suggest that an excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer inhibits wax accumulation, thereby affecting the ""attractiveness"" of apples.
Apples naturally develop a wax coating during their growth to help protect the fruit and retain moisture. A research team led by Li Yuanyuan, a professor at the Shandong Agricultural University, discovered a significant decrease in the wax content of both fruit and leaves in apple orchards where nitrogen fertilizer was excessively applied.
Subsequently, they selected and compared genetic materials from various apple samples collected from major apple-producing areas in Shandong, including the cities of Yantai, Zibo and Tai'an, and concluded that excessive nitrogen ultimately reduces wax accumulation on apples through a series of gene regulation pathways.
The findings also offer a theoretical basis for enhancing the defense of apples against biotic and abiotic stress, improving their color and luster, and extending shelf life, according to the researchers.

Chinese researchers develop new strategy for treating aggressive breast cancer
 (Xinhua) 15:12, January 04, 2024
SHANGHAI, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a new strategy for treating a form of highly aggressive breast cancer by converting treatment-resistant tumors to a more treatable state.
The study published on Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine unveiled this new approach, which can be integrated into existing regimens to improve outcomes in patients with deadly triple-negative breast cancer.
The researchers from Fudan University analyzed the metabolism of tumor samples from 401 patients with varying homologous recombination deficiency scores. The scores reflect a tumor's response to DNA-damaging drugs and those patients with a low deficiency score tend not to respond.
Researchers identified one molecule called GDP-M that impedes DNA repair of the tumor cells and raises the patient's deficiency scores, primarily by promoting the degradation of a cancer-linked protein.
In a mouse model, supplements of the molecule made the breast tumors more responsive to approved DNA-damaging drugs such as cisplatin and boosted antitumor immunity, according to the study.
Also, GDP-M was shown in the lab to be capable of empowering a class of targeted agents for breast cancer treatment called PARP inhibitors.
The new finding points to a clinical strategy combining GDP-M with other DNA repair-targeted therapy, said the researchers.

Chinese satellite captures images of strong solar flare
 (Xinhua) 15:11, January 04, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- China's solar exploration satellite Kuafu-1 has captured images of a strong solar flare emitted by the Sun on the first day of 2024, according to the Purple Mountain Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The solar flare, peaking at 5:55 a.m. Beijing Time on Monday, is classified as an X5.0 flare, the strongest in more than six years. Coronal mass ejections were also detected simultaneously by the satellite.
Solar flares are large explosions from the surface of the Sun that emit intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation, which can last mere minutes. They are rated based on their strength, with A-class as the smallest, followed by B, C, M and X as the most potent.
Flares and solar eruptions can impact high-frequency radio communications, electric power grids and navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.
Chen Anqin, chief forecaster of the National Center for Space Weather, said the impact of the solar flares on Earth would be minimal. However, other phenomena that accompany the flares, such as coronal mass ejections that reach Earth, can cause geomagnetic storms.
However, Chen said that X-class flares will become frequent occurrences in 2024.
Every 11 years, the Sun completes a solar cycle of calm and stormy activity and begins a new one. The current solar cycle, called Solar Cycle 25, began in December 2019. According to Chen, during each solar cycle, there are about 100 X-class solar flares, with nearly 20 X-class solar flares occurring in 2023 alone.
""Solar flares are expected to become more common in 2024 as the Sun rises to the peak of Solar Cycle 25, known as the solar maximum,"" Chen said.
The Kuafu-1 satellite was named after Kuafu, a giant in Chinese mythology who indefatigably chased the Sun. The satellite was launched aboard a Long March-2D rocket in 2022.

China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) released on Wednesday a fresh episode of the China space station vlog showing the busy work and life of the current Shenzhou-17 crew in orbit on the first day of the New Year.
""The year 2024 marks the second year of the application and development phase of the China space station. Looking back at 2023, our life in space was rich and varied, with fruitful scientific research. Looking ahead to this year, we will continue to conduct numerous scientific experiments in orbit, contributing to humanity's better utilization of space,"" Shenzhou-17 mission commander Tang Hongbo said in the video.
The current Shenzhou-17 crew is the third in the Shenzhou family to welcome the New Year in orbit on the Tiangong Space Station, reflecting the progress of China's space journey from space station key tech verification and construction to application and development, the CMSA said.
In the vlog, Tang Hongbo showed the audience the Feitian spacesuit which was undergoing maintaining work, and then he floated into the sleeping quarters of the space station where viewers could see the Shenzhou-17 crew had tailored their dorm with personal decorations such as photographs of family members, global and Chinese maps.
Following the mission commander's camera, Tang Shengjie, the No.2 taikonaut of the Shenzhou-17 crew, displayed his work of tending space vegetables such as potato sprouts. ""There are no bees in space, so I am working to pollinate the potato sprouts myself.""
Jiang Xinlin, the youngest crew member, showed us how he prepared food in the space station kitchen.
The New Year menu included rice, noodles, and fried rice according to each taikonaut's preference. Also, there was pork stew, vegetables, and even dumplings for the taikonauts to enjoy on the first day of 2024.
Taikonauts can also enjoy fruit such as apples and grapes, according to Jiang.
Since entering the Tiangong Space Station on October 26, 2023, the Shenzhou-17 crew has already completed about one-third of their six-month ""business trip"" to the station. Over the past two months, taikonauts Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie, and Jiang Xinlin have successively completed tasks such as platform maintenance, scientific experiments, and the first extravehicular activity for experimental repair of the solar wings of the Tianhe core module.
During their stay, the ""space vegetable garden"" has seen a strong harvest. The taikonauts have picked and tasted vegetables cultivated jointly by two crews and have packed the freshly harvested vegetables for preservation. The Shenzhou-17 crew will continue to carry out a series of space station missions as planned, according to the CMSA.

Chinese scientists develop new biodiesel fuel production technology
 (Xinhua) 09:23, January 04, 2024
NANJING, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed new technology allowing the manufacture of biodiesel fuel with higher biomass content, which could reach over 40 percent compared with the global average content of less than 10 percent.
Shen Jian, a professor at Nanjing Normal University's School of Chemistry and Materials Science, and his team improved the manufacturing process, using biofats (triglycerides) and crude oil refinery components to produce automotive biodiesel fuel without transesterification.
The higher the biomass content of biodiesel, the more outstanding its energy saving and carbon reduction effects are, the team said.
Partially replacing oil with biofats, the technology is conducive to China's efforts to promote more environmentally friendly biodiesel fuel and upgrade its emission standards, while also contributing to global carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, said Shen.
The results produced by a local quality supervision and inspection agency showed that this biodiesel fuel meets national standards for automotive biodiesel fuel, and has particularly good oxidative stability, corrosion resistance, lubricity and environmental protection features.
The research team, in cooperation with other companies, has set up an industrial production unit with an annual production capacity of two million tonnes of this biodiesel fuel, with the aim of speeding up the practical application of its technical achievements.

Chinese scientists reveal mechanisms regulating plant diversity on tropical islands
 (Xinhua) 09:12, January 03, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently revealed different mechanisms regulating plant diversity in tropical archipelagoes, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences' South China Botanical Garden.
Despite significant research in the field of island biogeography, our understanding of biodiversity and biological resources on most of China's marine islands remains limited due to the high costs and difficulties associated with island studies.
Researchers at the botanical garden selected two archipelagoes, including 16 tropical coral islands and 21 tropical continental islands, and analyzed the plant species diversity data and soil elements of 589 quadrats.
They found that the distribution pattern of plant species diversity in the two archipelagoes is in accordance with the classic biogeography species-area relationship theory, which dictates that the larger the island area, the higher the species diversity. But they also discovered that there are different mechanisms maintaining plant diversity in the two archipelagoes.
For the coral islands, they found that soil nutrients and spatial distance among communities play major roles in shaping plant community structure and species diversity. In contrast, they found that the direct effect of island area determines plant species richness on the continental islands, followed by the effect of soil nutrients.
The study has been published in the Plant Diversity journal.

China's FAST telescope detects scintillation arc in fast radio burst
 (Xinhua) 15:28, January 02, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Astronomers detected a scintillation arc in the spectrum of fast radio burst (FRB) for the first time using China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish and most sensitive radio telescope.
FRBs are mysterious radio flashes lasting only a few thousandths of a second that were confirmed in 2016 to originate from the cosmos. There is still no explanation for their origins.
An international group led by the researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' National Astronomical Observatories presented the interstellar scintillation analysis of fast radio burst (FRB) 20220912A during its extremely active episode in 2022.
According to a recent study published in the journal Science China Physics, Mechanics &Astronomy, the arc revealed that the scintillation might be caused by the ionized interstellar medium, or the material that fills the space between stars.
The discovery opens up a new approach of examining at the medium of fast radio bursts and their possible orbital motion.
The researchers also reported their method for detecting the scintillation arc, which may be applied generally to sources with irregularly spaced bursts or pulses, according to the study.
James Cordes from Cornell University said that the method used in this study can help find the FRB's host galaxy and the interstellar medium in the Milky Way.
FAST started formal operation in January 2020, located in a naturally deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province. It is believed to be the world's most sensitive radio telescope.

BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- On the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Chinese scientists recently discovered the phenological dynamics of wetland vegetation in response to climate change.
The study, led by researchers from Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, was recently published on the journal Global Change Biology.
According to the study, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which holds 20 percent of China's wetlands, plays a critical role to the regional carbon cycle. Understanding the influence of climate change on marsh vegetation requires an examination of the phenological dynamics.
In this study, the researchers used satellite-derived data and observational climate data to investigate the impact of climate change on the end of the growing season (EOS) of marsh wetland vegetation across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2001 to 2020.
Over a 20-year period, they discovered that the regionally averaged EOS of marsh vegetation was significantly delayed by 4.1 days every decade.
Researchers found that increasing preseason temperatures were the primary cause of the delay in the EOS of marsh vegetation, while preseason cumulative precipitation had little effect.
They also discovered that the reactions of EOS to climate change differed spatially across the plateau, showing that hydrological conditions play a regulating role in marsh phenology.
""Our findings underscore the need to incorporate hydrological factors into terrestrial ecosystem models, particularly in cold and dry regions, for accurate predictions of marsh vegetation phenological responses to climate change,"" said the study.
The study also noted that knowledgeable conservation and management strategies are critical in the face of current and future climate challenges.

TIANJIN, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a proton exchange membrane fuel cell with ultra-high volumetric power density, more than 80 percent higher than the performance of mainstream counterparts.
Jiao Kui, a professor at Tianjin University's School of Mechanical Engineering, and his team redesigned the proton exchange membrane fuel cell's architecture, incorporating new components and optimizing the gas-water-electric-heat transfer routes.
The team created an ultra-thin and ultra-high power density fuel cell. They eliminated traditional gas diffusion layers and flow channels by using ultra-thin carbon nanofiber film produced by electrospinning technology and metal foam.
This progress has contributed to a 90 percent reduction in the thickness of the membrane electrode assembly and a 80 percent reduction in mass transfer losses caused by reactant diffusion, nearly doubling the volumetric power density of the fuel cell.
The research team estimates that the peak volumetric power density of the fuel cell stack using the new structure will reach 9.8 kilowatts per liter.
Hydrogen fuel cells are regarded as one of the most promising technologies in the application of hydrogen energy. Increasing their volumetric power density, however, remains a significant technical challenge.
This breakthrough not only provides pivotal guidance for advancing proton exchange membrane fuel cell technology, but it also indicates a promising leap forward in the field of clean energy.
On Thursday, the findings were published in the international authoritative energy research journal Joule.

Thanks to comprehensive signal control and large traffic models, many citizens who drive in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area have noticed a significant decrease in the frequency of being stopped by a red light. In fact, they feel that they now often see green lights all the way.
The area, also dubbed Beijing E-Town, has joined hands with Chinese online search giant Baidu to integrate various sources of spatiotemporal data, including roadside perception data and internet data.
Based on this, they have utilized large traffic models to assess the possibility of traffic congestion and conducted simulation deductions to generate plans for comprehensive signal control and automatically optimize signal timing, transforming the traditional situation of vehicles waiting for lights into the current scene of traffic lights changing for the convenience of vehicles.
It's estimated that the implementation of comprehensive signal control across the area has reduced the average time it takes a vehicle to pass through a traffic light intersection by 28 percent.
Vertical domains, from transportation to culture and tourism, and from education to healthcare, witnessed intensive launches of various types of large models recently.
Compared to general-purpose large models, large models of vertical domains feature stronger expertise and can better solve domain-specific problems and provide more targeted services.
Ctrip, China's leading online travel agency, rolled out a large model named Ctrip Wendao for the tourism industry. The model supports natural language interaction, and is able to assist users with hotel and tourist attraction reservations, trip planning and other travel decisions.
China's leading AI and intelligent speech company iFLYTEK launched an app for medical services.
IFLYHEALTH, the new app based on the company's medical large model Spark Desk, has features including self-assessment of health, medical examination report interpretation, and health record management, thus providing health consulting services for users.
A research team from Nanjing Agricultural University in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu province, released a large language model (LLM) for ancient books.
Being able to perform lexical analysis, information extraction, intelligent poetry generation and other functions, the LLM is expected to be applied and promoted in the collation of ancient books, digital entertainment and other fields.
Data shows that over 250 companies and academic institutions in China had developed large models with over 1 billion parameters each as of October 2023, with vertical industry application becoming key track for large model utilization.

As the world's second-largest economy, China enjoys the advantages of a super-large market and rich digital resources, which enable it to provide large models with more sophisticated and richer application scenarios and an environment for continuous training, said Liu Yuanchun, president of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in east China's Shanghai.
Computing power is the foundation of large models, massive computing power is required during training and inference.
China is vigorously promoting its east-to-west computing resource transfer project, bringing development opportunities to intelligent computing centers in the western regions of the country.
On Nov. 30, 2023, Qinghai Kunlun Artificial Intelligence Computing Center, the first intelligent computing center in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, was officially inaugurated in northwest China's Qinghai province.
The computing center relies on the Sanjiangyuan national big data base located in the province for the management of computing resources and operations.
On Dec. 7, 2023, northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region signed its first large-scale computing center cluster construction project.
Using domestic full-function graphics processing units (GPUs) as its foundation, the cluster is expected to provide computing power for large model training and inference, as well as 3D graphics rendering and other tasks.
China aims to achieve a total computing power of over 300 EFLOPS by 2025 and increase the proportion of AI computing power in its overall computing power to 35 percent, according to an action plan for the high-quality development of computing power infrastructure issued by six Chinese authorities, including the MIIT, in October 2023. (EFLOPS is a unit of the speed of computer systems. 1 EFLOPS is equal to 1 quintillion floating-point operations per second.)

World must work together to strengthen AI governance,2024-01-01,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0101/c90000-20117051.html,"Home>>
		
World must work together to strengthen AI governance
By Huan Yuping (People's Daily) 11:16, January 01, 2024
Many international media, in their year-end reviews or next-year forecasts, listed artificial intelligence (AI) as a keyword.
They said AI has transformed from a synonym for science fiction to a tool used by millions of people, seeping into people's daily lives and driving industries toward the future. They believe that as 2024 approaches, AI innovations that break traditional boundaries will grow in strength.
However, along with the immense application and commercial value AI has brought, there were also unpredictable risks and challenges in 2023. At this critical juncture of AI's rapid development, strengthening AI governance becomes an urgent task that the international community must tackle together.
U.S. leading reference books publisher Merriam-Webster announced that the word ""authentic"" has been chosen as its Word of the Year for 2023. This decision was made due to the significant increase in the demand for authenticity caused by the rapid advancement of AI technology.
The global community has been paying unprecedented attention to preventing AI from spreading false information, infringing on personal rights and interests, posing security risks, and widening the technological divide.
It is widely recognized that there is a risk of misuse and abuse of AI due to the lack of effective safeguards.
With the accelerating AI application around the world, it is necessary for governments and organizations to consider how to leverage this technology for the benefit of humanity and the planet, said John Hoffman, CEO of GSMA Ltd. He emphasized the need to jointly establish a trustworthy environment for AI.
Good governance is essential for the healthy development of AI. The impact of AI on human society depends on whether the international community can seek benefits and avoid harm through effective governance.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pointed out the need to approach this technology with a sense of urgency, a global lens, and a learner's mindset. Countries should engage in coordination, set boundaries, and work tirelessly to ensure that AI benefits humanity.
China has released an interim regulation on the management of generative AI services; the UN has established the High-level Advisory Body on AI; the AI Safety Summit has issued the Bletchley Declaration; the EU has reached an agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act.
Over the past year, there has been a deepening understanding of the urgency of AI governance, and related actions have been accelerating.
However, in the face of such a disruptive technology that may profoundly impact the trajectory of human civilization, governance challenges still exist widely. It is crucial to enhance global coordination and cooperation.
As a responsible AI powerhouse, China has always attached great importance to AI governance. While gradually establishing and improving relevant laws, regulations, and institutional systems at home, China actively contributes its wisdom to strengthening global AI governance.
China has put forward the Global AI Governance Initiative, which systematically elaborates on China's approach to AI governance in terms of development, security, and governance.
The initiative adheres to the systematic thinking that puts equal emphasis on development and security, upholds a people-centered approach in developing AI, adheres to the principle of developing AI for good, and upholds the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit in AI development.
It provides constructive solutions to the development and governance of AI that are of common concern to all parties, and serves as a blueprint for international discussions and rule-making in this field.
China has also actively engaged in communication, exchanges, and pragmatic cooperation with all parties on global AI governance. During the meeting between the Chinese and U.S. heads of state in San Francisco, both sides agreed to promote government talks on AI, injecting new impetus into strengthening global AI governance and inspiring the international community.
AI marks a new field of human development, and effective governance is essential for its healthy development and for the benefit of humanity.
Facing diverse challenges to world peace and development, countries must uphold a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. They should pay equal importance to development and security, consolidate consensus through dialogue and cooperation, and build an open, fair, and effective governance mechanism.
Only by doing so can they jointly promote the healthy, orderly, and secure development of AI, and ensure that AI always progresses in a direction that is conducive to the advancement of human civilization.

Archaeologists shed insights on historical, contemporary topics in Shanghai forum
 (Xinhua) 17:49, December 31, 2023
SHANGHAI, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- A Tang Dynasty (618-907) style hairpin inlaid with turquoise, a Greco-Iranian gold ornament with a mermaid motif, silverware engraved with figures from Greek mythology -- audiences were fascinated by the illustration of these antiques as Han Jianhua delivered his academic report at the 5th Shanghai Archaeology Forum.
Han, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) Institute of Archaeology, highlighted these relics unearthed from a nomadic tribe tomb as evidence of how an unified multi-ethnic Chinese nation was formed in diversity and how civilizations along the ancient Silk Road interacted in history.
Noting the robust cultural exchanges between China and Iran during the Tang Dynasty, Yaghoub Mohammadifar, a professor of archaeology at Bu-Ali Sina University in Iran, said he is keen to take the forum as a new starting point for future cooperation with Chinese counterparts.
The recently-concluded forum was jointly hosted by the CASS and the Shanghai municipal government, and attended by more than 200 scholars from over 40 countries and regions. Since its inception in 2013, the forum has become a key platform for worldwide archaeologists to exchange their ideas.
Christina Warinner, an associate professor at Harvard University, said the forum brings together the world's best archaeologists who research different regions and different periods to share the latest discoveries, exchange good ideas, and inspire each other.
""The forum not only offers a wide and interesting range of topics but also promotes a better understanding among archaeologists worldwide of China's place in world history,"" said Lothar Ledderose, a professor at Heidelberg University in Germany, who has studied Chinese art history for over sixty years.
Koji Mizoguchi, a professor at Kyushu University in Japan, noted that in many ways, Chinese archaeology continues to produce unique contributions that expand the understanding of the diversity in human lifestyle, society, and culture.
In addition to historical topics, archaeologists also weighed in on the value of archaeology in tackling contemporary issues such as climate change.
""Studying climate change requires us to look at the big picture through a microscope. To address the challenges that global climate change presents to everyone around the world, we need to see historically. Archaeology offers us insights that enable us to protect people's future,"" said Judith Bunbury, a geo-archaeologist at the University of Cambridge.
Other archaeologists echoed the view by showcasing archaeological findings of how global climate has changed over the course of history.
The narrative ability of archaeology has the potential to inspire people to take responsible actions to meet the challenges of global climate change and promote consensus and unity on a global scale, said Mizoguchi.
