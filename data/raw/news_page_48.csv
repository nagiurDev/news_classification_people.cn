Doctors from a Xi'an hospital performed xenotransplantation surgery on March 25, in which the kidney of a multi-gene-edited pig was transplanted into a brain-dead human. The kidney is still functioning well 13 days later, Beijing-based Science and Technology Daily reported on Monday.
Qin Weijun, head of urology at Xijing Hospital of the Air Force Medical University in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, told the newspaper that his surgical team transplanted the gene-edited pig kidney into the brain-dead recipient's body.
As of Sunday, the transplanted kidney had been functioning for 13 days, and was working well in the recipient's body, producing urine normally, Qin said.
According to Science and Technology Daily, this is another milestone breakthrough in the field of xenotransplantation for Qin's hospital, after it made the world's first xenogenetic liver transplantation from a multi-gene-edited pig into a brain-dead recipient.
The surgical plan was created and approved by various academic and ethics committees, and carried out strictly in accordance with relevant national regulations. The family of the patient gave consent for the research to contribute to medical advancement, according to media reports.
With the advancement of gene editing technology, pigs as donors have gradually emerged as one of the preferred candidates for human xenotransplantation due to their organ tissue structure, physiological function, and size being akin to human organs, coupled with their distant relation to humans, which can help evade rejection responses.
Editing genes of pig cells is a relatively mature technology, and pigs have strong reproductive capabilities and are easy to raise on a large scale. These factors make pigs the best choice for xenotransplantation donors under current technological conditions, Qin explained.
In recent years, with the in-depth development of gene editing technology and immunology, xenotransplantation research has dramatically progressed, and it may become an effective way to solve the organ shortage, Qin said.
Scientists said that the research represents a critical step toward the forefront of xenotransplantation in China, which will pave the way for clinical research and clinical application of xenotransplantation. It will also likely provide new options for patients with end-stage renal disease in the future.

HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's first domestically made icebreaker Xuelong 2 on Monday arrived in the country's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for a five-day visit.
Xuelong 2, which came to Hong Kong for the very first time, entered the Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui on Monday morning after completing their latest Antarctic expedition.
Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, John Lee, chief executive of the HKSAR, said that Xuelong 2 is China's first domestically built polar icebreaker for polar expedition, possessing a number of key technologies and innovations.
Lee said that the first stop of Xuelong 2's return voyage is Hong Kong where the country's Antarctic expedition team will share with the public their work and scientific research results, fully demonstrating the central government's care for Hong Kong.
Sun Shuxian, deputy minister of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that in October 2004 when China's 21st Antarctic expedition was going to begin, the country's polar research vessel Xuelong visited Hong Kong and received a warm welcome.
After 20 years, Xuelong 2 will push ahead with the exchanges and cooperation between scientific research institutions in mainland and Hong Kong in the field of polar research, Sun said.
Zhang Beichen, chief scientist of China's 40th Antarctic expedition and the team leader, said that Xuelong, Xuelong 2 and cargo ship Tianhui set off from Shanghai on Nov. 1, 2023 and successfully completed various expedition tasks that lasted 161 days with a total of more than 81,000 nautical miles.
The organizing committee of Xuelong 2's visit hoped that the visit will promote Hong Kong people's understanding of the country's polar expedition, especially young people's interest and enthusiasm for polar scientific research.
The icebreaker will be open for public visits from Tuesday to Friday. During their stay in Hong Kong, the Antarctic expedition team will hold a two-day international conference on climate change at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Xuelong 2's scientists will meet with about 200 students at the Hong Kong Science Museum where the ""Polar Research and Climate Change"" exhibition was held.
Xuelong 2 is China's fourth polar research vessel, following Xiangyanghong 10, Jidi, and Xuelong. It measures 122.5 meters in length, with a displacement of nearly 14,000 tons, a total installed power of 23.2 megawatts, and a capacity of 101 members.

Chinese researchers unravel high-yielding mechanism of cultivated tomatoes
 (Xinhua) 16:00, April 08, 2024
FUZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently discovered the formation mechanism behind self-pollination in cultivated tomatoes, providing valuable insights for increasing tomato yield.
Researchers from the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University have found that tomatoes can alter the structure of floral organs by regulating the development of trichomes in themselves, thus adopting a self-pollination method to enhance their fruiting rates.
Domesticated tomatoes achieve this anatomically by forming a cone around the male anthers, which ensures that pollen can easily reach the stigma. The anther cone is held together by a dense network of hairs called zipper trichomes.
Researchers identified a set of homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) genes that regulate the formation of these trichomes. Simultaneously, these genes regulate the length of the female style, allowing coordinated development of a self-pollinating reproductive structure.
In agriculture, self-pollination in plants leads to higher fruiting rates and ensures the inheritance of excellent traits, making it one of the key objectives in crop modification for humanity, said Wu Minliang, a researcher of the study.
The research findings was published in the journal Science.

A research group from Donghua University in Shanghai has developed a new type of smart fiber that can achieve human-machine interaction functions such as luminous display and touch control without relying on chips and batteries.
The research was published in the Science journal on Friday, and is regarded as offering new possibilities for changing the interaction mode between humans and the environment.
The magazine noted that working electronic components into fabrics is challenging because they usually require rigid batteries or chips, but the author of the research showed the potential for wireless digital interactions with a number of simple examples.
The research proposes using the human body as a conduit for energy interaction. This principle promotes a new energy interaction mechanism known as ""human body coupling."" With specific functional materials added, the fiber achieves functions like touch control, luminous display on fabric, and wireless command transmission.
The group has been focusing on the field of light-emitting fiber materials for about five years. ""In one experiment, we accidentally discovered that fibers emit light in a radio field. Based on this, we proposed a new type of smart fiber with a 'non-von Neumann architecture,' integrating functions such as energy harvesting, information sensing, and transmission into a single fiber,"" said Hou Chengyi, a researcher from the Advanced Functional Materials Research Group at Donghua University.
The new type of fiber also offers comfort and stability. ""Through testing, we found it skin-friendly. We've tested its stability and practicality for two years, and the results have been relatively stable,"" Hou told the Global Times.
In the future, the group aims to produce clothes with the smart fiber that are as comfortable to wear and as intelligent as smartphones. However, there are still obstacles to overcome before the products can be sold, such as signal interference and the durability and stability of the fiber.

This aerial photo taken on June 22, 2023 shows China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) under maintenance in southwest China's Guizhou Province. China's FAST telescope identified a binary pulsar with an orbital period of 53.3 minutes, the shortest known period for a pulsar binary system.The research, mainly conducted by a team led by scientists from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), was published in the journal Nature Wednesday. (Xinhua/Ou Dongqu)
China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish and most sensitive radio telescope, has announced that the application channel for free observation projects for the 2024 observation season will open to the world from Saturday.
FAST, or the ""China Sky Eye,"" is currently accepting applications for the observation season which runs from August 2024 to July 2025, with the deadline for submissions set for May 15, 2024, at 12am Beijing time, according to multiple Chinese media reports.
According to Sun Chun, a measurement and control engineer at FAST, scientists from around the globe can apply for their observation projects for the 2024 season through this channel, state-owned broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday.
FAST has received applications from 15 foreign countries and approved a total of nearly 900 hours of observation access for foreign research teams since March 31, 2021, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
The 15 countries include Germany, Italy and France, and the applications mainly involve fast radio burst observations, pulsar observations, and neutral hydrogen surveys, Sun said.
Currently, FAST is carrying out observation tasks related to pulsar search, pulsar timing, neutral hydrogen surveys, and fast radio bursts.

China's homegrown aircraft safeguarding green mountains
By Hu Tao (Xinhua) 13:33, April 07, 2024
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- In a remarkable display of innovation and dedication, China's domestically-developed aircraft are taking to the skies to protect the country's lush green mountains.
Multiple models of newly-developed large unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and fixed-wing aircraft are showing their unique capabilities in ecological conservation, such as putting out forest fires and alleviating spring drought, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the country's leading aircraft manufacturer.
The mountainous region of Yajiang County in southwest China's Sichuan Province faced a challenging spring when a devastating forest fire erupted in mid-March. However, relief came swiftly as multiple specialized aircraft were deployed to support firefighting and disaster relief operations.
During the mission, three models of the Wing Loong large civil UAV family and the MA-60 weather-modification aircraft played a crucial role in tasks ranging from aerial disaster monitoring to telecommunications restoration and artificial rainfall enhancement, the AVIC said.
The forest fire in Yajiang County presented unique difficulties due to its mountainous terrain with steep slopes and high elevations averaging 2,600 meters. It was extremely hard for rescuers to monitor the fire and reach the affected areas, especially at night and amidst dense smoke.
Sent by emergency management and meteorological authorities, the three Wing Loong UAVs coordinated their efforts by integrating fire monitoring, meteorological observation and rainfall enhancement in an innovative way.
Each specialized aircraft brought its own unique strengths to the missions. One provided real-time images of the fire sites and set up a telecommunications network; another relayed crucial meteorological data such as wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, while the third conducted rainfall enhancement operations to support firefighting efforts and reach inaccessible areas.
This is the first time for China to carry out emergency rescue missions, combatting forest fires, through collaborative efforts of multiple large UAVs. The move verified the respective advantages of these new aircraft and provided a new comprehensive solution for disaster prevention and mitigation, the AVIC said.
Multiple models of the Wing Loong UAV family have been used and integrated into emergency governance, meteorology and other key fields, according to the developer, AVIC (Chengdu) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System Co., Ltd. (AVIC UAS), an AVIC subsidiary based in southwest China's Chengdu.
In addition to its involvement in forest firefighting efforts in Sichuan, the MA-60 weather-modification aircraft was also engaged in various other missions this spring.
From mid-March until now, the specialized medium-sized fixed-wing airplane has conducted multiple rounds of artificial rainfall enhancement in northwest China's Shaanxi Province to address local meteorological challenges.
This special-purpose aircraft, featuring a heavy payload, long endurance and multi-functions in artificial weather modification operations, can effectively ease spring drought and support plowing.
It has also become a key player in the country's weather modification work. To date, four airplanes of this model, developed by AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd., based in northwest China's Xi'an, have been delivered to the China Meteorological Administration.
Clear waters and green mountains are not only natural and ecological wealth but also social and economic riches, with the concept -- ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"" -- becoming the country's consensus and action guide.
The widespread application of these advanced aircraft in ecological conservation reflects China's unwavering commitment to safeguarding its green mountains. More domestically-developed aircraft are in the pipeline to bolster the country's disaster response capabilities and protect people's lives and property, AVIC noted.

Modern agricultural technologies aid sugarcane planting in south China,2024-04-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0406/c90000-20153519.html,"Home>>
		
Modern agricultural technologies aid sugarcane planting in south China
 (Xinhua) 13:37, April 06, 2024
NANNING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- As heavy rain clouds gather over Shangtang Village in Wuxuan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, drovers eye their buffalo herds in the distance and hasten their pace, while unmanned tractors maintain their steady advance across the sugarcane fields.
During this spring plowing season, farmers sitting behind the driverless sugarcane tractors, guided by the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), drop sugarcane seeds at regular intervals. With the help of the automated tractors, the process of planting, fertilizing, and mulching can be completed in one go.
Modern agricultural technology and mechanization were a real game changer for Wuxuan County, one of China's major sugarcane planting areas. Today, the seeding of sugarcane is ten times more efficient than before.
Tractors now follow a pre-designed route planned by the BDS.
""With the help of BDS, we can control the deviation of the straight lines within two centimeters, as well as control the distance within five centimeters between each line, which can benefit photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients and oxygen in sugarcane,"" said Wu Qihui, director of Wuxuan Bosheng Agricultural Machinery Specialized Cooperative. ""Also, the favorable ventilation is crucial to achieve high yield.""
Having been planting this common cash crop in southern China for more than 10 years, local farmer Lu Ruwen joined the cooperative in 2020, which hires out agricultural machinery and equipment.
""It used to take a week to plant by hand my 20 mu (about 1.33 hectares) of farmland, but now just one day to finish all the work,"" he said. The whole process of sugarcane planting can be mechanized with all the of tools available in the cooperative, which help reduce at least 100 yuan (about 14 U.S. dollars) per mu, according to him.
In addition to the efficient equipment, quality sugarcane seeds are also crucial to boosting yields.
In the cooperative's breeding base, rows of tall, bushy sugarcane ready for harvest are the early-maturing, high-sugar variety introduced from the regional academy of sciences.
""Later they will be cut into 20-centimeter-long stalks and then disinfected in our processing workshop,"" said Wu, adding that their standardized sugarcane seeds are popular because of their higher yield, which can produce eight tonnes per mu.
With better policy support for agricultural production, local villagers are more and more willing to participate in the development of modern agriculture.
""The government also has corresponding subsidies for those who adopt mechanized farming methods or disinfected and healthy sugarcane varieties,"" explained Mo Tingjin, director of the Agricultural Mechanization Service Center of Laibin. ""Many farmers can even plant sugarcane at zero cost with these subsidies.""

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China has attached great importance to artificial intelligence (AI) development in recent years to build itself into a major global AI innovation center.
Technologies such as face recognition, voice recognition, intelligent robots, virtual reality, and driverless vehicles, have been widely used in the country, covering fields like education, medical care, science and technology, logistics, agriculture, and entertainment.
According to a development planning for new-generation AI, China aims to become the world's major AI innovation center by 2030, with the scale of its AI core industry exceeding 1 trillion yuan (about 140.9 billion U.S. dollars), and the scale of related industries exceeding 10 trillion yuan.
China has introduced policies in terms of scientific and technological research and development (R&D), application promotion, and industrial development, to solve major application and industrialization problems of artificial intelligence.
Many local governments are also accelerating the integration of innovation resources to promote the development of AI technology and related industries.
Beijing boasts rich AI talent resources, strong R&D and innovation capabilities, and active product iteration in the field of AI development.
According to a report on the development of China's AI industry in 2023, Beijing has about 28 percent of the country's 2,200 AI enterprises, ranking first in the country.
Last year, Beijing released a detailed plan to promote the development of AI. According to the plan, by 2025, the scale of its AI core industry is scheduled to reach 300 billion yuan.
At present, Beijing is speeding up the layout of frontier AI basic theory and key core technologies.
Other Chinese regions such as Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan are also seizing AI opportunities.
The city of Shenzhen in Guangdong plans to build a national pilot zone for AI innovation and a national demonstration zone for AI application. AI will be among key technologies to receive the support of the municipal government.
Shanghai is also promoting the high-quality development of the AI industry and fostering an ecology for large-model innovation. Over 20 AI large models have passed the audit and record of local government, said Zhang Ying, head of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization.
The city's innovation center for large model industrial application has attracted nearly 60 enterprises in less than half a year after its operation, Zhang said.
The total scale of China's AI core industry has reached 500 billion yuan, and the number of related enterprises has exceeded 4,300, sources from China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said.
As a strategic technology leading a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial change, AI technology will promote the deep integration of digital technology and the real economy, and foster new industries, said Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlytek.
In his eyes, China has formed a comparative advantage in the fields of voice large model and medical large model.
However, some experts noted that there is still a gap between China and other countries in terms of underlying algorithms, key hardware and software, and ecosystem of AI.
The scientific and technological community must work with enterprises to promote technological development and industrial change in the future, including accelerating the cultivation of a large model open innovation ecosystem and promoting the cultivation of top innovative talent, they said.
China has a broad market for AI applications, but it still faces challenges in terms of basic technologies and talent, according to Dai Qionghai, chairman of the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence and a Tsinghua University professor.
""We should deepen the training of AI talent, enhance basic research, and strengthen original innovation in terms of policies, mechanisms and investment,"" he said.

(Xijing Hospital of the Air Force Medical University/Handout via Xinhua)
XI'AN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers announced Wednesday that they have successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig kidney into a brain-dead person and it has been functioning for nine days, marking another breakthrough after a gene-edited pig liver was transplanted into a brain-dead person last month.
The latest transplant was guided by Dou Kefeng, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the surgery was performed by a team led by Qin Weijun, a doctor at Xijing Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, on March 25.
During the operation, lasting six hours and 15 minutes, the surgical team transplanted the gene-edited pig kidney into the brain-dead recipient's right iliac fossa, according to Qin.
After removing the vessel blocking clamp, the transplanted kidney showed excellent perfusion and produced urine immediately. Intraoperative ultrasound showed good blood perfusion in the transplanted kidney, indicating that no hyperacute rejection occurred, he said.
The surgical plan was deliberated and approved by various academic and ethics committees, and carried out strictly in accordance with relevant national regulations. The family of the patient gave consent for the research to contribute to medical advancement.
In recent years, with the in-depth development of gene editing technology and immunology, xenotransplantation research has dramatically progressed, which may become an effective way to solve the organ shortage, Qin said.
Qin said that the research represents a critical step towards the forefront of xenotransplantation in China, which will pave the way for clinical research and clinical application of xenotransplantation, and provide new options for patients with end-stage renal disease in the future.
On March 10, the hospital successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a brain-dead person. It functioned for 10 days before the study was terminated according to the wishes of the recipient's family.

Scientists propose new bird family tree, revises bird evolutionary history
 (Xinhua) 14:32, April 03, 2024
HANGZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An international team has revolutionized the system of bird classification and rewritten our understanding of the evolutionary history of birds.
Despite tremendous efforts in the past decades, the relationship among main avian lineages remains controversial.
The researchers, led by Chinese zoologists from Zhejiang University, analyzed the genomes of 363 bird species in 92 percent of all extant families and presented a new, well-supported evolutionary tree.
The Neoaves, a group that includes the vast majority of bird species, are classified into four major groups: Mirandornithes, such as flamingos; Columbaves, such as pigeons; Telluraves, including parrots and eagles; and Elementaves, according to the study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday.
According to the study, elementaves is a newly proposed grouping comprising about 14 percent of all modern bird species, including seagulls, albatrosses, penguins, hoatzins, and swifts.
Also, they confirmed that a mass extinction event destroyed all non-avian dinosaurs about 66 million years ago, thus providing an opportunity for birds to diversify rapidly and occupy a wide range of ecological niches.
""Our work has changed many traditional views on the evolutionary history of birds,"" said Zhang Guojie from Zhejiang University.
""This new family tree will serve as a solid backbone for mapping the evolutionary history of all bird species with important implications for ornithological research and biodiversity studies,"" added Zhang, the paper's corresponding author.
The study is part of an international collaboration program called the Bird 10,000 Genomes Project to map the genomes of approximately 10,500 existing bird species.

China's rice technology nourishing Africa's needs

In China's vast rice breeding community, Hu Fengyi is in the minority.
Over the past two decades, the plant scientist at Yunnan University has maintained a sharp focus on mining the potential of a perennial rice variety originally from Africa, which can be harvested multiple times and reduces labor costs.
Unlike hybrid rice and other conventional high-yield varieties, perennial rice has received limited academic attention in the past.
""There are lots of researchers studying rice in China, and if your research is mainstream you are able to compare notes with your fellow researchers,"" he said.
However, perennial rice is such a little-researched field that it is impossible to work with others to fast-track progress. ""You have to feel the way forward in the darkness,"" Hu said.
Through trial and error, Hu and his colleagues have combined the perennial variety with mainstream ones, and rolled out three hybrid varieties that can transcend rice's normal life cycle, and when grown in the right environment provide stable yields.
Compared with hundreds of new rice varieties approved for commercial production across the country each year, the three hybrid ones approved for commercial production after decades of research are a telltale sign of the solitary nature of rice scientists' work. ""To make it, we had to sit on a cold bench,"" Hu said, using a Chinese saying that describes someone being left out. ""We've learned to withstand solitude.""
Two of Hu's hybrids were named after the college he works at — Yunda 107 and Yunda 25.Over a three-year trial period, Yunda 25 produced 5.5 to 6.5 metric tons annually per hectare and showed outstanding resistance to pests, which greatly reduced the need for pesticides.
""It is not unlike rolling out new car models,"" Hu said, referring to the enhanced traits of newer perennial varieties. ""You can add functions to newer models and can improve existing ones.""
Apart from reducing labor, Hu said perennial rice is also more ecologically friendly as farmers do not have to plant every year. ""The soil conditions are less disturbed physically as well as chemically,"" he said.
Perennial rice's popularity has grown quickly in China and among its rice-producing neighbors. In 2020, less than 4,000 hectares of perennial varieties were planted, but a year later the number ballooned to more than 15,500 hectares.
The expansion of perennial rice is also representative of China's shift to a more tech-driven approach to improve agricultural productivity and ensure the security of staple food supplies.
Honoring promises
As part of its commitment to help Africa improve the continent's food security, China has started to share its perennial rice technology, a move which has been hailed by both agricultural experts and farmers.
The technology was incorporated into the agricultural technology advancement framework at the High-Level Ministerial Session of the fifth African Union Specialized Technical Committee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water, and Environment held in November last year.
It has also been included in the African Union Seeds and Biotechnology Program 2024-2025, and has already been introduced in Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar and Burundi, through collaborations between Chinese and African agricultural experts.
Luo Tingyue, a Chinese technician for the FAO-China-Uganda South-South Cooperation (Phase 3) program who has been promoting rice-planting technologies in Uganda for five years, said he and his colleagues started to grow perennial rice in September.
The rice, which is planted at the China-Uganda Agricultural Cooperation Industrial Park in Lubenge wetland in Uganda's Luwero district, was harvested last month.
Noting that perennial rice can be harvested several times after planting, he said it saves a great deal in labor costs and farmers' time, making it a superior species for use in African countries.
In addition, perennial rice has also demonstrated higher yields compared with many conventionally grown species in Uganda, Luo said. It produced 1.5 to 2.5 metric tons per 4,050 square meters in trial production, compared with around 1 ton for conventional rice, he said.
""The grain looks longer and bigger,"" Luo said, holding a handful of rice. ""According to our measurements, every 1,000 grains of the rice weighs 29 grams, compared to between 23 and 26 grams for every 1,000 grains of locally planted rice species.""

Sowing knowledge
To ensure good rice yields, Luo and his colleagues have been teaching rice-planting techniques to local farmers in recent years — including how to plant seedlings and how to use fertilizers and pesticides. However, the educational process has had to overcome hurdles.
For instance, in China, farmers usually plant the lower part of rice seedlings in the paddy field's water in order to promote the growth of the roots. However, many farmers in Luwero plant rice seedlings much deeper in the water.
""We are also cooperating with local agriculture departments to jointly train rice farmers here, hoping that they will learn advanced planting techniques to improve rice yields,"" Luo said.
Jimmy Lamo, the cereals program leader at Uganda's National Crops Resources Research Institute, said perennial rice has already been planted in several irrigation areas of the country.
The perennial rice variety has grains that are similar to the popular local variety called Super, which is aromatic and soft when cooked. Local people have started calling the perennial variety ""New Super"", Lamo said.
Perennial rice doesn't require a lot of water and when it's grown in upland areas that receive a lot of rain, farmers get an ample yield, he said.
""It has an upland trait in it and an irrigated trait, which is unique and makes it a game changer,"" Lamo said.
As plowing is only done once, the soil and the microorganisms' ecosystem are not disturbed, which is very healthy for the environment, he added.
Perennial rice can help improve food security in Africa, Lamo said, as it's easy to store and transport, unlike other sources of starch which have more moisture that can be lost during transportation.
The easy storage of perennial rice makes it a good option for busy communities and an attractive commodity to feed people in the rapidly expanding urban areas of Africa, Lamo said.

Practical benefits
George Katwalo, a farmer in Luwero who has been given the opportunity to plant Chinese perennial rice, said the yields are higher than traditional varieties.
He harvested 1.7 tons of perennial rice from a field that normally produced one ton or even less.
""I now prefer perennial rice because it gives me a good income. Its demand in the market is also high. I encourage other farmers to try it,"" he said. ""When cooked, it's soft and has a good aroma.""
Since witnessing its advantages, Katwalo said he plans to plant perennial rice over a larger area.
According to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China is committed to helping Africa establish production bases and large-scale warehouses for several major grain products such as hybrid rice, cassava and soybean, to enhance some countries' capacity to ensure food security and self-sufficiency.
Lamo said the presence of China in Africa and its sharing of new commodities could revolutionize agricultural production on the continent. He noted that China is advanced in terms of value-added technology as well as mass production, while Africa has plenty of arable land.
Africa has 65 percent of the world's remaining uncultivated arable land, an abundance of fresh water, and about 300 days of sunshine each year, according to the African Development Bank Group.
In addition, more than 60 percent of Africa's working population is engaged in agriculture, and the soil in many African nations is rich and fertile.
""Soybean and rice rotation improves fertility, increases income and provides the opportunity for large-scale marketing. Cassava, on the other hand, is an industrial crop and food crop. We need it in hospitals, confectionery (production) and in other areas at the same time,"" he said.
With warehouses in strategic locations and China's aid in the development of the road network across Africa, the continent's agricultural sector is poised to greatly benefit, Lamo said.

Other options
Long Wenjing, a researcher from the Sichuan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, in Chengdu, who is also engaged in promoting perennial rice, said the lack of proper irrigation systems in Uganda poses a major challenge for the variety. He said they will try to provide more technical support to locals to overcome the challenge.
In addition to perennial rice, Long and his Chinese colleagues are also selecting other agricultural crop species that may be suitable for Uganda's conditions.
""We are focusing on the introduction and development of new species under the FAO-China-Uganda South-South Cooperation (Phase 3) program,"" he said.
""We have selected more than 100 plant species from China, and are testing them in Uganda, including at the China-Uganda Industrial Park for Agricultural Cooperation.""
In addition to agricultural crops, Chinese experts are also working with their Ugandan counterparts to introduce, test and promote animal husbandry and introduce certain fish species.
In addition, they are teaching locals how to raise fish on rice farms, a practice widely adopted in many agricultural areas of China.
Efforts are already underway to introduce a big-eared goat species from Sichuan province to Uganda, Long said. The species features characteristics such as a faster growth rate, higher meat yield and stronger tolerance to certain diseases.
""We hope through our concerted efforts, the new species, including the perennial rice, can help contribute to improved food security in Uganda and other African countries,"" he said.
Hu, the Yunnan University researcher who developed perennial rice, said rice is a food staple in Africa, but productivity remains low.
""Perennial rice technology is what Africa needs right now, and I am willing to do everything within my power to facilitate the knowledge transfer.""
