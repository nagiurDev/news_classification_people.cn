China home to 3.92 million 5G base stations
 (Xinhua) 10:55, July 24, 2024
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of 5G base stations in China had risen to nearly 3.92 million by the end of June, data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology showed on Tuesday.
The figure represented a net increase of 540,000 5G base stations over the end of last year, and accounted for 33 percent of the total number of mobile base stations nationwide, according to the data.
The number of 5G mobile subscribers in the country increased by 105 million from the end of last year to reach 927 million as of the end of June this year.
The figure accounted for 52.4 percent of the total mobile subscribers in China's three major telecommunication enterprises and China Broadnet, which stood at nearly 1.78 billion by the end of June, the data showed.
The aforementioned three telecommunication operators are China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.
China has seen its 5G network and commercialization develop rapidly in recent years. The country's 5G network now covers every city and town in the country, as well as more than 90 percent of its villages, the ministry said earlier this month.
Since the issuance of China's first batch of 5G licenses for commercial use five years ago, 5G technology has been integrated into various sectors such as industry, power, mining, healthcare and education, with large-scale promotion and application.
China has also built 300 5G factories and launched over 13,000 projects for the application of ""5G plus industrial internet.""
The ministry said last month that 5G commercialization had directly spurred total economic output of approximately 5.6 trillion yuan (about 785 billion U.S. dollars) in China over the past five years.
It has said that China would continue to advance 5G development and expand 5G network coverage in places such as cultural and tourism sites, healthcare facilities, universities, transportation hubs and subway systems.

China has achieved another significant milestone in its development of the new-generation manned carrier rocket, with the successful completion of a long-duration high-altitude simulation test for the vehicle's third-stage liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen engine, the Global Times learned on Tuesday.
The test has verified the feasibility of the rocket engine working for long periods in space, laying a solid foundation for the smooth progress of the country's future lunar manned exploration program, industry insiders said.
The test was conducted on a newly constructed vertical high-altitude simulation test stand, the first of its kind in China and the longest-duration hydrogen-oxygen engine high-altitude simulation test stand internationally, the Global Times learned from the Sixth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).
The successful completion of this long-duration test suggests that the vehicle's engine achieved the milestone of a thousand-second level test capability, representing a substantial improvement in China's liquid rocket engine testing technology.
This development will significantly support the smooth progression of China's manned lunar exploration program, the Sixth Academy said in a statement.
The CASC previously disclosed that the new-generation manned carrier rocket is expected to possess the capability of sending payload of 27 tons to the Earth-lunar transfer orbit and that of 70 tons to near-Earth orbit.
The new powerful rocket is expected to be ready for its maiden flight by 2027, according to the CASC.
China's lunar exploration program has been advancing steadily with its ""circle of friends"" continuing to expand. A research institute in Hungary has recently become the latest partner to join the China and Russia co-led International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to build a permanent base on the moon around 2035.
The Hungarian Solar Physics Foundation had signed a memorandum of understanding on ILRS cooperation with China's Deep Space Exploration Laboratory, during which it expressed its intention to strengthen cooperation with China in the area of deep space exploration, according to the lab's official WeChat account on July 19.
The joining of this organization from Hungary - both an EU and NATO member - has brought the total number of ILRS partners to around 25, according to media reports.
The Hungarian Solar Physics Foundation holds significant influence in the fields of solar physics and heliophysics and has been engaging in extensive collaborations with numerous universities and research institutions, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Science and Technology of China.
It is worth noting that Turkey is reportedly the first NATO member state to apply to join the ILRS project at a national level.
According to a report by Russia's TASS news agency in April, Anatoly Petrukovich, director of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that Turkey has submitted an application to participate in the ILRS project led by China and Russia.

Mineral enriched with water molecules discovered in Chang'e-5 lunar sample,2024-07-23,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0723/c90000-20196983.html,"Home>>
		
Mineral enriched with water molecules discovered in Chang'e-5 lunar sample
 (Xinhua) 16:16, July 23, 2024
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has identified in a lunar sample retrieved by Chang'e-5 a kind of mineral enriched with water in its molecular structure.
An increasing body of evidence has pointed to the existence of water or water ice on the moon's surface, but it is more likely to be in the form of hydroxyl groups.
Now, scientists led by those from the Institute of Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences have discovered a hydrated mineral that contains up to six molecules of crystalline water.
According to a study published recently in the journal Nature Astronomy, water molecules weigh as much as about 41 percent of the total mass.
The researchers said this discovery signifies the first direct detection of molecular water within the lunar regolith, shedding light on an actual form of water molecules and ammonium on the moon's surface.
The mineral's structure and composition bear a striking resemblance to a mineral found near volcanoes on Earth. At the same time, terrestrial contamination or rocket exhaust has been ruled out as the origin of this hydrate, according to the study.
This finding has unveiled a potential form in which water molecules may exist on the lunar surface: hydrated salts. Unlike volatile water ice, these hydrates are very stable in high-latitude regions of the moon, even in sunlit areas.
The researchers said this discovery opens up new possibilities for the future development and utilization of lunar water resources.
Utilizing in-situ resources on the moon will lay a foundation for establishing a long-term lunar station. China aims to build the basic model of an international lunar research station by 2035.

XINING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists embarked on an expedition on Saturday to investigate the water resources and ecological environment in the headwater regions of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers.
The expedition, comprising around 20 members, will carry out scientific investigations into river hydrology, water ecology, soil erosion, glaciers and permafrost in northwest China's Qinghai Province.
Key research projects include estimating the carbon stock of wetlands, assessing the impacts of permafrost thawing on the plateau, and measuring the thickness of permafrost on glaciers.
The field expedition is jointly organized by the Changjiang River Scientific Research Institute (CRSRI) of the Changjiang Water Resources Commission, along with other organizations. It is set to last 10 days.
It will further the understanding of the current state of the ecological environment in the headwater regions of the two rivers, and will provide basic data for research projects including the protection of the Yangtze River and the construction of Sanjiangyuan National Park, said the CRSRI's chief engineer Xu Ping.
Qinghai is home to the Sanjiangyuan area, which contains the headwaters of China's three major rivers: the Yangtze River, the longest in China; the Yellow River, the second-longest; and the Lancang River, which is known as the Mekong River after it flows out of China.
As important parts of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem, the headwater regions of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers play a crucial role in safeguarding water resources, protecting biodiversity and ensuring ecological stability.
Annual scientific expeditions to the source of the Yangtze River have been conducted since 2012.

Palm-sized drone uses solar power, smashes records

A palm-sized Chinese drone weighing less than a sheet of paper has captured widespread media attention because its innovative motor allows it to continue flying as long as it receives sunlight.
The solar-powered machine was designed by researchers at Beihang University in Beijing, known for its expertise in aeronautical and astronautical research. It is just a 10th the size of the previous record-holder as the smallest solar-powered aircraft and one 600th of its weight.
Micro aerial vehicles have a host of applications, from environmental monitoring to search and rescue, making them versatile tools. They can perform specialized tasks such as capturing images, detecting objects, and transporting items in confined spaces. However, limited flight duration poses a significant obstacle to their usefulness.
Traditional micro aerial vehicles use electromagnetic motors to power their rotors. However, the small motors overheat at high speeds, causing a sharp drop in energy conversion efficiency. Natural sunlight can be a potential alternative as an energy source, but the smaller a drone gets, the less surface area it has to collect sunlight, lead researcher Qi Mingjing said.
In its study, published on Thursday in the journal Nature, the research team said that traditional flying machines weighing less than 10 grams could only stay aloft for up to 10 minutes.
To overcome the efficiency challenges, Qi and his colleagues developed an electrostatic motor that uses the Coulomb force, the force between electrically charged particles at rest, to generate continuous rotating motion. The drone's name, CoulombFly, comes from its unique motor.
A demonstration video presented by the researchers shows that the motor works by creating a circle of electric charges, which generates a twisting force to make a single blade spin like those on a helicopter.
The advantage of such a motor is that it can effectively reduce heat, co-author Peng Jinzhe said.
""This is because static electricity operates at high voltage and low current,"" Peng said. ""The lower the current, the less heat it generates.""
The energy conversion efficiency of flying machines weighing less than 5 grams and powered by such static electricity could exceed 10 times that of traditional electromagnetic motors, with less than a 10th of the power consumption required for the same lift, according to the study.
Before the breakthrough, Harvard University researchers published a paper in Nature in 2019 introducing the Robobee aircraft they developed, which was once considered the highest level in the field of micro aerial vehicles. However, it relied on an artificial light source, equivalent to three times the intensity of natural sunlight, for sustained flight.
The CoulombFly can achieve continuous flight solely relying on natural light, representing a significant leap forward, the Beihang researchers said.
After further development, the new drone motor technology is expected to be applied in emergency rescue operations, narrow space detection, and other similar scenarios, said Professor Yan Xiaojun, one of the lead researchers of the study.

* The fact that the largest global IT outage so far was caused not by cyberattacks or ill-intentioned actors but, ironically, by a routine update from a cybersecurity software, has once again exposed the systemic risk stemming from an increasingly omniscient and intertwined digital infrastructure and a world which relies on it.
* While individual organizations are recommended to spend more resources on off-grid back-ups and staff training over working without computers, some argue the incident showcases the urgency to regulate the highly monopolized market.

BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Airlines, media, retailers, hospitals, banks, and essentially, any organization that relied on CrowdStrike's service to protect their Microsoft system from viruses and malware, are still recovering from the unprecedented global IT outage on Friday, with 8.5 million Windows devices affected.
Experts and analysts regard the incident as a wake-up call for a more resilient and less monopolized global digital infrastructure, warning that the world will be more vulnerable facing such disruptions, which could become a ""new normal.""
UNPRECEDENTED OUTAGE
On Friday, customers across the world of CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm based in Austin, Texas, started to see the ""blue screen of death"" on their Windows system after installing a faulty Falcon sensor update on Thursday night.
Essentially, Falcon monitors what is happening on the computers on which it is installed and looks for signs of nefarious activity (such as malware). This means that Falcon is deeply integrated into Microsoft's system to the extent that when it falters, the system does too.
""We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines,"" said Microsoft in its blog post on Saturday.
Following what Microsoft calls ""significant incidents,"" the company said it has ""maintained ongoing communication with customers, and is working with CrowdStrike and external developers to collect information and expedite solutions.""

Just hours following the outage, scams, phishing emails, and other criminal activities started to target CrowdStrike customers concerning the incident, under the guise of customer service and technical support.
""The scale of this outage is unprecedented, and will no doubt go down in history,"" said Dr. Junade Ali, a cybersecurity expert and fellow at the London-based Institution of Engineering and Technology.
""Unlike some previous outages that targeted Internet infrastructure, this situation directly impacts end-user computers and could require manual intervention to resolve, posing a significant challenge for IT teams globally,"" Ali added.
Experts estimate a full recovery from a disruption at such a scale will take weeks. ""It seems that millions of computers are going to have to be fixed by hand,"" said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a cybersecurity company.
Recovery is particularly challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises, which have fewer resources and IT staff to do the manual fixing, said Joe Tidy, a BBC cyber correspondent on Friday.
MORE DISRUPTIONS TO COME
Almost 30,000 flights were delayed on Friday and nearly 7,000 were canceled worldwide, according to Euronews.
The incident resulted in a significant drop in CrowdStrike's value, wiping billions off the company's market value when trading opened on Friday. The same day, Wall Street's major indexes declined, exacerbating a sell-off fueled by tech stocks and mixed earnings reports.
""The outage is likely to intensify regulations for critical services and risk management,"" said Dr. Madeleine Stevens, an IT expert at Liverpool John Moores University.
""Despite the incident not being a cyberattack, consumer skepticism will inadvertently be impacted, and this unintended demonstration of our cyber vulnerability will raise significant challenges for IT service providers,"" Stevens said.

The fact that the largest global IT outage so far was caused not by cyberattacks or ill-intentioned actors but, ironically, by a routine update from a cybersecurity software, has once again exposed the systemic risk stemming from an increasingly omniscient and intertwined digital infrastructure and a world which relies on it.
More ""digital pandemics"" like this are expected to emerge from enhanced global economic integration, said John Bryson, chair of Enterprise and Economic Geography at Birmingham Business School, the University of Birmingham.
The global cyber-energy-production plexus, or the ""multiple connections between telecommunications, energy, and production networks,"" leave us all exposed to unknown disruptions at an unprecedented scale, Bryson added.
Axel Legay, a professor of computer science at the Catholic University of Leuven, said that the more interconnected a computer is, the more vulnerable it becomes.
""The more interconnected the software is, the more vulnerable we will be, because more and more software will interact and it will increase,"" Legay said in an interview with Euronews Next.
BACK-UPS AND ANTI-TRUST
The largest cyber incident so far has offered lessons to stakeholders from tech companies, regulators, and businesses to prepare for more frequent and widespread disruptions in digital infrastructure in the future.
""A core issue is the ability of a digitally-enabled service function to switch immediately to manual,"" Bryson said.
""In other words, there needs to be an ability to provide services using paper rather than digital solutions. The real danger is that we all forget how to live and work in a pre-digital environment,"" he said.
The IT expert also highlighted the importance of companies having ""air-gapped"" back-ups, which are isolated from the cyber-energy-production plexus.
While individual organizations are recommended to spend more resources on off-grid back-ups and staff training over working without computers, some argue the incident showcases the urgency to regulate the highly monopolized market.

The outage ""is the result of a software monopoly that has become a single point of failure for too much of the global economy,"" George Rakis, executive director of NextGen Competition, whose group advocates for more stringent antitrust enforcement, was quoted as saying by The Washington Post on Saturday.
The report added that legislators from three Congressional committees -- House Oversight, House Homeland Security, and House Energy and Commerce -- asked Microsoft and CrowdStrike to brief them on the cause and impact of the outage on various agencies on Friday.
""When just three companies -- Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet Inc.'s Google -- dominate the market for cloud computing, one minor incident can have global ramifications,"" wrote Parmy Olson, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology, on Friday.
Olson argues that policymakers could address the world's over-reliance on just three cloud providers and push the Big Techs to do more than simply administer a band-aid.
Why does a global computational infrastructure seem to have one point of failure? Brooklyn-based columnist Edward Ongweso Jr. asked in a Guardian analysis on Saturday.
Because of concentration, consolidation, and monopolization, he argued. ""We've had these sorts of outages before and nothing has changed, partly because the tech industry has been so adept at shifting blame. If that continues, then the monopolists will do what they please and everyone will suffer what they must,"" he said.

Researchers identify new therapeutic target for ovarian cancer,2024-07-19,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0719/c90000-20195735.html,"Home>>
		
Researchers identify new therapeutic target for ovarian cancer
 (Xinhua) 15:19, July 19, 2024
WUHAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have recently identified eTreg cells as a new immunotherapy target for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), paving the way for new precision treatment strategies.
Ovarian cancer has long ranked among the top ten malignant tumors in women, with HGSOC accounting for nearly 70 percent of cases. For clinically challenging cases where complete surgical removal is difficult, the standard treatment strategy remains platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
This approach initially achieves high response rates but often leads to drug resistance over time. As a result, the five-year survival rate for patients has stagnated around 30 percent, highlighting the persistent challenges in improving outcomes for HGSOC.
Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) refers to a condition where cells have impaired ability to repair DNA double-strand breaks through the homologous recombination pathway.
HRD is often associated with an increased risk of genomic instability and cancer development. The presence of HRD in HGSOC not only contributes to its development but also impacts treatment strategies.
Researchers from Tongji Hospital in China and the MD Anderson Cancer Center in the United States initiated a clinical trial of the neoadjuvant PARP inhibitor niraparib for HRD-positive HGSOC based on the concept of reverse translational medicine.
PARP represents a family of enzymes involved in DNA repair. PARP inhibitors block these enzymes, preventing cancer cells, especially those with HRD, from repairing DNA damage, leading to cell death.
During the four-year study, researchers analyzed the unique immune characteristics of the microenvironment in HGSOC, and utilized single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T-cell receptor sequencing to screen tens of thousands of potential targets, according to Gao Qinglei, a professor from the Tongji Hospital.
They identified a novel immune target, eTreg cells, in HRD-positive ovarian cancer, and proposed an immunotherapy strategy that involves depleting eTreg cells and activating immune cells to effectively target and treat the tumors.
They also established HRD mouse models, and discovered that depleting eTregs in the models, with or without PARP inhibition, significantly suppresses tumor growth without observable toxicities, underscoring the potential of eTreg-focused therapeutics for HGSOC and other HRD-related tumors.
""The challenge in treating ovarian cancer lies in cancer cells evading the body's immune defenses. Not only do they escape the surveillance of the immune system, but they also 'capture' immune cells,"" Gao said.
She noted that by eliminating eTreg cells, the ""imprisoned"" immune cells can be activated to regain their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells.
The study was published in the international journal Cell.

Chinese researchers have successfully developed an ultralight sunlight-powered micro aerial vehicle (MAV) weighing only 4.21 grams, capable of sustained flight using natural sunlight as its power source, which is expected to have wide applications in the national economy, according to Beihang University. The study was published in the journal Nature on July 17.
The MAV has a wingspan of 20 centimeters and weighs 4.21 grams. It's powered by a new type of electrostatic motor as its engine core, which enables takeoff and sustained flight solely on natural light energy.
The research achievement was independently developed by a research team at Beihang University, and is expected to significantly increase the flight duration of MAVs, expanding its range of applications in the future, the university said in a report published on its official WeChat account on Thursday.
Limited flight duration is a considerable obstacle to the widespread application of MAVs, especially for ultralight MAVs weighing less than 10 grams, which, in general, have a flight endurance of no more than 10 minutes, researchers from Beihang University wrote in the study published in Nature, titled ""Sunlight-powered sustained flight of an ultralight micro aerial vehicle.""
Previous studies have not been able to achieve sustained untethered flight of ultralight MAVs fully powered by natural sunlight due to limited payload capacity and low lift-to-power efficiency of traditional propulsion systems. Sunlight power is a potential alternative to improve endurance of MAVs, according to the study.
Due to MAVs' small size, light weight, and high maneuverability, MAVs can perform specialized tasks such as photography, detection, and transportation in confined spaces with wide applications in the national economy.
MAVs often have short flight times, because traditional electromagnetic motors used in these vehicles generate heat and have low energy conversion efficiency when miniaturized. The efficiency can drop to below 10 percent, making it difficult to meet flight requirements even with solar energy as a power source due to limitations in solar panel area, according to the researchers.
In order to solve the problems, researchers developed a micro electrostatic motor, and successfully tested flying the electrostatic aerial vehicle ""CoulombFly."" The motor has low speed, low heat generation, and high efficiency in a small size, making it a breakthrough in micro engine principles, said the university.

It is the daily work of battery expert Xu Aiqin to find a balance between battery life, charging, weight and cost performance.

Battery expert Xu Aiqin is testing battery safety(People's Daily Online/Chen Hao)
The automotive industry is the premier industry of Hefei city, Anhui Province. In recent years, Anhui automotive industry pioneering company Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd. (JAC) has adeptly navigated the changing landscape, focusing on the new energy vehicle (NEV) sector. In 2011, upon graduating from Hefei University of Technology with a master’s degree in Vehicular Engineering, Xu committed herself to the growing field of NEVs. She has since been a part of the development of 10 new pure electric vehicles for JAC.
At 8 a.m., Xu arrives at the battery safety test cabinet. Today's task is to observe the safety performance of the new batteries at extreme conditions, including testing the batteries at temperatures up to 130℃.
“In the battery field, thermal runaway safety, - that is, ensuring the safety of the entire battery pack when a single cell fails – is of the utmost importance,” Xu explained. After investing a great deal of time and effort, JAC has introduced a revolutionary new battery design. The new design, which is in the shape of a honeycomb, achieves thermal isolation, electric isolation, and thermal decoupling creating a much safer battery. “Each battery undergoes 100 consecutive explosion tests, in which there is zero tolerance for any thermal spread following a single cell combustion,” added Xu, emphasizing the strict safety standards in place.
Small sized yet powerful battery packs are driving NEVs forward and are helping to promote the development of Hefei’s premier industry. In 2023, Hefei produced 1.34 million vehicles,

The ""help"" Bao refers to is the ""Interactive aerial imaging technology"" independently developed by Han.
This technology allows an image of Bao’s script to appear in the air in front of him, without it being visible to anyone else. What’s more, people can operate and work on the displayed images in the same manner one would use a computer screen.
After finishing with visitors in the morning, it was already 2 p.m. These days, many people visit Anhui Easpeed Co., Ltd., which was founded by Han in 2016. At that time, he was still a first-year master’s degree student at the University of Science and Technology of China.
""The key to the realization of air imaging is in the glass,” says Han. In Anhui Easpeed Co., Ltd., there is a room stacked with substandard glass. ""Each piece represents a failure and the beginning of a new attempt,” added Han.
With the successful development of the negative refractive slab lenses, or DCT-plates, and the sensors required for interaction, Anhui Easpeed Co., Ltd. has mastered the interactive aerial imaging technology.
""Core technology can't be bought,” exclaimed Han. Looking back on the journey, Han reflected emotionally regarding how the technology was once controlled by others. Today though, the company has repositioned itself from follower, to competitor, to leader in the industry. As a now industry leader, the company has been able to apply its technology in fields such as displays, medical equipment, automobiles, home appliances, and more. The company is currently valued at 3 billion yuan ($ 412 million).
In Hefei, technological entrepreneurship is thriving. The city has cultivated 188 national-level specialized and innovative ""little giant"" enterprises, over 8000 national high-tech enterprises and 11,000 national science and technology based small-medium sized enterprises.

Sun Hantao discusses technical issues with his colleagues (People's Daily Online/Chen Ruotian)
Sun, born in the 90s, is from Henan Province, central China. Ten years ago, after graduating from Jilin University, he directly entered into a PhD program at Peking University, studying quantum transport. In 2019, he entered the industry and joined a major internet company in Hangzhou. At the beginning of this year, he relocated to Hefei and became the leader of the quantum computing technology department of China Telecom Quantum Group, where he is responsible for the group's cloud platform construction, physical machine control and other work.
The achievements of Sun and his colleagues are obvious to all.
Taking the cloud platform as an example, the ""Tianyan"" quantum computing cloud platform has currently integrated the same 176-bit superconducting quantum computer as the Zuchongzhi No. 2, achieving leadership in both real machine and simulation capabilities. Sun reveals that the group has also developed a quantum programming framework based on domestically produced instruction sets, as well as an ecosystem for quantum computing education and industrial applications, effectively securing control over both hardware and software.
""The number of quantum enterprises in Hefei ranks first in China, including a premier enterprise in the industry like China Telecom Quantum Group,"" said Sun. Sun will continue to work hard to contribute to the development of the industry.
With the efforts of people like Sun, Hefei quantum information, fusion energy, deep space exploration and other future industries will be developed.

Liu Xiaodi is doing research, and for her, doing experiments all night is common(People's Daily Online/Chen Hao)
Liu is a researcher at the Institute of Solid State Physics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2013, after graduating from the University of Science and Technology of China, she sat on the ‘cold bench’, a term for unheralded tasks, for basic research and dedicated herself to the production of metallic hydrogen. ""Almost all of my work revolves around this main thread,” said Liu.
The production of metallic hydrogen is known as the 'Holy Grail of High Pressure Physics', which explains just how difficult the task is.
""Creating ultra-high pressure is one of the most difficult problems,"" according to Liu. There is speculation that to get metallic hydrogen, pressures of 5 or 6 million atmospheres are required. For context, 10,000 atmospheres are roughly the equivalent pressure created by an elephant stepping on something while wearing high heels.
In the experiment, she operates a press using diamond anvil cells (DAC) to apply pressure to the hydrogen. ""At present, our pressure is close to the pressure needed to produce metallic hydrogen,” said Liu.
""It gives us great confidence,"" Liu remarks, indicating that through the optimization of the press, diamond anvil cells, and the process involved, it will soon be possible to achieve ultra-high pressure. With ultra-high pressure achieved, it will be possible to successfully produce metallic hydrogen, allowing for the exploration of its novel properties including superconductivity and superfluidity.
When Liu Xiaodi walked out of the laboratory, there was already daylight.
This is an ordinary 24 hours in innovative Hefei.
A new day, and it all begins again.

Even rarer than Rh-negative blood, a B subtype blood has been identified in a hospital in Handan, North China's Hebei Province for the first time worldwide, expanding to scientific understanding of blood types and enhancing the effectiveness of blood transfusions.
Cui Ningning, a technician from the Handan First Hospital's blood transfusion department received a novel specimen from a patient who was recommended for blood transfusion in April, according to local media on Thursday.
Despite several attempts, Cui failed to identify the donor's blood type.
Cui then reported the unusual situation to the head physician Dong Peiyun, who, relying on extensive expertise, acutely recognized that the sample was likely to be subtype B.
Following a series of serologic identifications of the patient's specimens, the results confirmed Dong's initial judgement, according to the media.
As identified, the rare blood type belongs to a new subtype of type B.
The genetic sequence of this blood type has been submitted to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) t, and it has been formally added to the human DNA sequence database within the NCBI under the code PP928483, according to media reports.
Dong explained that accurate blood group matching is essential for safe blood transfusion since the blood group system is characterized by a multitude of novel subtypes that arise due to genetic changes in humans.
Finding this rare blood type will not only broaden scientific understanding of blood types, but also further guarantee the safety of clinical blood transfusions, Dong added.
