Researchers unveil how ancient Denisovans survived on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau,2024-07-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0704/c90000-20189361.html,"Home>>
		
Researchers unveil how ancient Denisovans survived on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau
 (Xinhua) 11:09, July 04, 2024
LANZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest research has shed light on the behavior of ancient Denisovans, who lived around 160,000 years ago on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, uncovering clues to how they survived a highly diverse range of environments.
Published in the journal Nature online on Wednesday, the study unveiled a new hominin rib specimen dating back approximately 48,000 to 32,000 years ago. It revealed the Denisovans' adaptation strategies to the diverse and fluctuating environments during the late Middle and Late Pleistocene in eastern Eurasia.
Researchers from Lanzhou University, the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and some other institutions worldwide jointly conducted the study.
The Denisovans are an extinct group of archaic humans named after the Denisovan Cave in Siberia where they were first discovered. Zhang Dongju, one of the researchers from Lanzhou University, said the Denisovans had contributed genetically to modern populations across Oceania, East Asia, South Asia and the Americas.
A research team led by Chen Fahu from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences has carried out multidisciplinary studies on a mandible fossil, or lower jawbone fossil, found at the Baishiya Karst Cave site located in Xiahe County of Gansu Province in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. The Xiahe specimen indicated that it belonged to Denisovans. The study was published in Nature in 2019.
According to Zhang, in addition to identifying a new hominin rib specimen, researchers also identified over 20 categories of animals, including herbivores such as wild yaks and carnivores like hyenas, snow leopards and Tibetan foxes, as well as small mammals like plateau hares and marmots.
More than 2,500 animal bones were unearthed during previous archaeological excavations. Further zooarchaeological and proteomic analyses have helped researchers obtain more information about these remains.
The research also revealed that Denisovans engaged in animal resource processing and consumption in the cave, including skinning, dismembering and defleshing. Additionally, the bones were used as raw materials for the production of tools.
Chen said the Denisovans in the cave made full use of diverse animal resources, which likely helped them survive on the plateau for at least 100,000 years.
Experts emphasize the significance of these findings in understanding Denisovans' physical and genetic characteristics, activities and adaptations to high-altitude environments. They also offer critical materials and new clues for researching the coexistence of Denisovans with early modern humans in East Asia, as well as their genetic and cultural exchanges.

Chinese and French researchers complete lunar radon-gas detection mission
 (Xinhua) 08:39, July 04, 2024
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A collaborative team of Chinese and French researchers has successfully completed a mission to measure the distribution of radon gas and polonium on the moon, employing the French payload aboard China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe for the purpose, according to the Institute of Geology and Geophysics (IGG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The French payload, named Detection of Outgassing RadoN (DORN), is capable of measuring both radon gas and its decay products on the lunar surface, as well as charged particles in the space environment.
Its scientific goals include studying the origin and dynamics of the lunar atmosphere, the thermal and physical properties of lunar soil, and the movement of lunar surface dust.
He Huaiyu, co-chief scientist of the DORN from the IGG, noted that the payload equipment of the Chang'e-6 radon-gas detector had been exposed to the Earth's atmosphere for several months before launch.
It was first activated on May 6 during the lunar-orbit cruise period, some 320,000 kilometers from Earth, and worked for about 10 hours to measure the background noise of the space environment and natural pollution on the lunar surface.
On May 17, following the historic solar storms that occurred between May 10 and 11, the instrument was powered on again. It performed measurements in lunar orbit for a total of 32 hours.
""The data beamed back to Earth helped the team confirm that all 16 detectors of the radon-measurement instrument were functioning properly, obtaining data on the flux of charged particles in the solar wind and tracking their decay over time. The lunar shielding effect on these particle fluxes was also observed,"" said Li Jiannan, Chinese technical head from the IGG.
The DORN was restarted on May 23. It proceeded to conduct orbital measurements of radon and polonium distribution on the moon for a duration of 111 hours.
On June 2, shortly after the Chang'e-6 lunar probe landed at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon, the radon-gas detector began its measurements of the lunar surface. On June 4, when the ascender of Chang'e-6 took off from the moon with samples, it completed its detection mission and became a ""permanent resident"" on the far side of the moon.
Noting that the collaborative team worked together on the operation of the radon-gas detector at the National Astronomical Observatories of China, He said that this marks the first collaboration between China and France in the field of deep-space exploration, contributing to the success of the mission.
China's Chang'e-6 spacecraft was launched into orbit on May 3, carrying four international payloads from the European Space Agency, France, Italy and Pakistan.
The country's Chang'e-7 lunar exploration mission will carry six international scientific instruments, and Chang'e-8 will offer 200 kilograms of international payload capacity and has garnered over 30 applications, said Liu Yunfeng, deputy director of the China National Space Administration's international cooperation department on June 27.

BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhou-18 crew members, who are currently on board China's orbiting space station, have been preparing themselves for the second extravehicular activities, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
In a video footage released by the CMSA, the three astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu were performing in-orbit rendezvous and docking maneuver training.
During the process, the astronauts could use the display screen to monitor the azimuth angle and pitch angles of the target spacecraft, track the relative distance and speed between the spacecraft and the target, and hone their operational skills in speed and attitude control using translational and attitude hand controllers.
The crew also conducted cardiopulmonary exercise function tests to assess their cardiovascular and respiratory systems' functional and regulatory capabilities.
The trio performed a slew of space science experiments and tests during the past two weeks, according to the CMSA.
They conducted regular operations including burner replacement and vacuuming of exhaust gases in the combustion cabinet.
In 2023, China successfully performed the first in-orbit ignition test in the combustion cabinet. Over the past year, multiple combustion experiments have been completed, promising to yield significant scientific results. These endeavors are pivotal for advancing combustion theory and developing advanced combustion technologies.
The crew also installed a sliding track positioning component to the science glovebox. This facility provides a sealed and clean environment crucial for conducting space science experiments.
They replaced the experimental samples in the fluid physics experiment cabinet. This cabinet facilitates in-orbit microgravity experiments on the dynamic processes, diffusion processes, phase transitions, and self-organization behaviors of various fluid systems.
In addition, the astronauts conducted an in-orbit electroencephalogram (EEG) test. The EEG signal testing and analysis could shed light on the physiological mechanisms underlying changes in astronauts' cognitive abilities during long-term spaceflight. This serves as an important testing method in in-orbit experimental studies of space ergonomics and brain science.
On April 25, China launched the Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship, sending three astronauts to its orbiting Tiangong space station for a six-month mission. They completed their first spacewalk on May 28.

GUANGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- At a smart manufacturing center in south China's Guangdong, as bunches of grapes moved along the conveyor belt, the sizes and sugar contents of each grape were displayed on a screen.
This method contrasts with traditional practices where grapes are squeezed to extract juice for sugar content measurement and grape sizes are manually assessed for grading purposes to determine pricing.
According to Ye Shenglang, a grape farmer, grape grading heavily relies on experienced workers, who are scarce during peak production seasons. Therefore, both growers and dealers are enthusiastic about technologies that could transform the industry.
""With the help of hyperspectral sensing and artificial intelligence (AI), we can now aid dealers in swiftly grading grapes without causing damage or requiring physical contact with the grapes,"" said Liu Yisen, associate researcher at the Institute of Intelligent Manufacturing at the Guangdong Academy of Sciences.
Liu explained that grapes, being produced in bunches, create a more complex reflection of light compared to other fruits, presenting challenges for testing. However, with the assistance of AI, his team has developed a data model capable of effectively and efficiently assessing grapes.
The grapes cultivated by Ye belong to the Shine Muscat variety, which has seen significant popularity in the Chinese market in recent years.
Initially, Shine Muscat grapes had higher sugar content; however, as more farmers started growing this grape, new varieties emerged that looked good but tasted bad, leading to unstable quality and driving prices down.
Ye said that he plans to use AI technology in the next production season to help boost his income.
Guangdong, one of China's most economically developed provinces and the most populous, recorded a GDP of 13.57 trillion yuan (about 1.9 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2023, with the permanent population reaching 127 million, according to official data.
""Guangdong's modernization heavily relies on the development of agriculture, which is also the foundation of the region's urbanization and industrialization,"" said Hu Jing, director of the research center for agriculture and urbanization at South China Normal University.
At a vegetable plantation hub in Huadu District, located in the provincial capital Guangzhou, a mechanical arm was seen planting two dozen lettuce seedlings onto a seedling bed within seconds before transporting them into a greenhouse. At the other end of the transport line, ripe vegetables freshly picked from the greenhouse awaited packaging.
The plantation features multiple advanced technologies, including automatic seeding, intelligent germination acceleration and intelligent harvesting, which boost the output to an annual yield of 20 tonnes per mu (about 0.07 hectares).
""These innovative technologies save approximately 40 percent of land, 80 percent of water and 90 percent of labor costs compared to traditional methods,"" said Liu Huanhuan, who works at the plantation hub.
Sensors placed around the field collect data on humidity, temperature, barometric pressure and light levels, while integrated systems for water and fertilizer are computer-managed, enabling year-round lettuce cultivation.
""Advanced technologies like AI can help bridge the gap between cities and rural areas, accelerating common prosperity and contributing to the goal of revitalizing rural areas,"" Hu said.

Chinese scientists reveal shape of Milky Way's dark matter halo,2024-07-03,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0703/c90000-20188577.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists reveal shape of Milky Way's dark matter halo
 (Xinhua) 09:48, July 03, 2024
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently proposed that the current dark matter halo of the Milky Way is ""slightly oblate.""
The study, conducted by researchers from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), in collaboration with several domestic and international research institutions, was published in the latest issue of the journal Nature Astronomy.
Scientists believe that the shape of the dark matter halo is key to understanding the hierarchical formation of the Milky Way. Despite extensive efforts in recent decades, its shape remains a matter of debate, with suggestions ranging from strongly oblate to prolate.
Based on observational data from the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite and China's Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), the researchers analyzed about 2,600 Cepheid variable stars of different ages. They applied a new method called ""motion picture"" to construct a three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way's disk at different ages over a period of 250 million years.
In the nearby universe, nearly one-third of disk galaxies are not perfect disks but exhibit a warped shape resembling a potato chip. Astronomers refer to this phenomenon as a disk warp. The Milky Way, as a typical disk galaxy, also has this warp feature.
By ""seeing"" how the disk warp evolves with age, the researchers found that the warp precesses in a retrograde direction at a rate of 0.12 degrees per million years.
""Previously, there was a lack of precise measurement on how the disk warp swings,"" said Huang Yang, the co-first author of the study, and an associate professor with UCAS.
Based on their measurements, the research team found that the current dark matter halo enveloping the warp exhibits a slightly oblate ellipsoidal shape.
""Only this shape can explain the precession rate of the warp,"" Huang said.
""This measurement provides a crucial anchor point for studying the evolution of the Milky Way's dark matter halo and the assembly history of the Galaxy,"" Huang added.

SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's homegrown regional jetliner, the ARJ21, launched its first high-plateau air route on Tuesday in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
The regional air route connects southern Xinjiang's Kashgar Laining International Airport with Khunjerab airport in Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, a land port on the China-Pakistan border situated in the Pamirs region of south Xinjiang.
A plateau airport is defined as one at an altitude exceeding 1,500 meters above sea level, while those above 2,438 meters are classified as high-plateau airports. The Khunjerab airport, located at 3,258 meters above sea level, is the first high-plateau airport in Xinjiang.
Chengdu Airlines, based in southwest China's Sichuan Province, stated that it has deployed the ARJ21 aircraft on this route due to its excellent performance.
The aircraft developer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC) said it took into consideration the air transport needs of high-altitude airports when designing and developing the ARJ21 aircraft.
The reliability of the aircraft has been verified through repeated high-altitude test flights over the years, the COMAC said.
As a pioneer of Chinese commercial airplanes, the ARJ21 was put into commercial service by Chengdu Airlines in June 2016.
Chengdu Airlines has set up three bases in Xinjiang, deploying nine ARJ21 aircraft to serve 24 local airports on more than 40 flight routes.
In June, the ARJ21 launched its first air route to Central Asia linking Kashgar Prefecture in Xinjiang with Khujand in Tajikistan.
