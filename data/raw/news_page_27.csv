TIANJIN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bohai Oilfield, China's largest offshore crude oil production base, has completed the drilling operations of a new 6,088-meter-deep well, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Tianjin branch said on Tuesday.
The well, Bohai 19-6-D1, will be used for the oil and gas recovery of the Bozhong 19-6 Condensate Gas Field, the first gas field with proven reserves of over 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Bohai Sea.
The oil drilling industry generally classifies wells with depths exceeding 6,000 meters as super-deep wells. These wells serve as essential tools for extracting deep-sea oil and gas resources and exploring the Earth's deep layers.
The complex geological conditions, with a formation temperature of more than 180 degrees Celsius and a maximum bottom-hole pressure of 56 megapascals, have raised the bar of its drilling operations. In addition, the construction crew had to drill through two underground mountains riddled with fractures.
Two mega projects -- the respective phase one project of the Bozhong 19-6 Condensate Gas Field and the Bozhong 26-6 Oilfield -- are currently under construction by the Bohai Oilfield. The two projects, once completed, are expected to meet the basic energy demands of a city with a population of 10 million for an entire year.

China gains momentum in sci-tech breakthroughs
By Yan Dongjie (China Daily) 10:34, June 26, 2024
China has achieved a series of recent breakthroughs in scientific frontiers such as quantum physics and artificial intelligence, attracting widespread global attention, and the momentum is expected to increase as the nation strives to become a major science and innovation center.
Xue Qikun, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who received the top national science and technology award on Monday, said, ""The country's economy is in a period of rapid development, and the support for higher education, scientific research, and talent is, in my opinion, the best in history.""
In recent years, breakthroughs by Chinese scientists have included the brain-like Tianmoc computer chip, which mimics how the human visual system processes information and will enhance the response speed and security of artificial intelligence; development of a quantum experimental system that is expected to propel advancements in quantum physics research and quantum computing; and discovery of key evidence of the existence of nanohertz gravitational waves — the ""ripples"" produced by massive objects in space such as black holes — by using China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope.
Such achievements were made possible, observers said, by China's top leadership with President Xi Jinping at its core, which played a heralding role in the drawing up and implementing of the nation's science and technology development blueprint and enabled scientists like Xue to witness the once unimaginable become reality.
In his report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October 2022, Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said, ""If China wants to be strong and prosperous, it must vigorously develop science and technology and strive to become a major scientific center and innovation center in the world.""
Building a modern socialist power in an all-around way as scheduled will depend on scientific and technological self-reliance, he emphasized.
Innovation in science and technology has become increasingly crucial, and the competition increasingly fierce, he added.
Xue, also president of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen and a professor at Tsinghua University, said he believes that China's fundamental research is at its best developmental stage ever.
""In the scientific frontiers yet to be explored by humanity, Chinese scientists have great potential,"" he said. ""We must seize major research opportunities continuously and focus on tackling key issues in quantum technology.""
President Xi said on Monday in Beijing, while presenting medals and certificates to the recipients of the top Chinese sci-tech award, that ""a nation thrives when its science and technology thrive, and a strong science and technology sector makes a strong nation"".
He also stressed that science and technology hold a strategic leading position and play a fundamental supporting role, when he set out his vision at the event on Monday to build China into a strong nation in science and technology by 2035 and called for high-level technological self-reliance and self-improvement.
China's research and development funding increased from 1.03 trillion yuan ($142 billion) in 2012 to 3.3 trillion yuan last year, with research and development spending accounting for 2.64 percent of GDP, which surpassed the average level of that in the European Union.
The country's expenditure on basic research increased by 9.3 percent last year, with the proportion of investment in basic research exceeding 6 percent for five consecutive years.
According to data from the National Intellectual Property Administration, as of the end of last year, China's number of granted invention patents exceeded 4 million, ranking first in the world.
""Among these over 4 million effective invention patents, high-value patents account for over 40 percent,"" said Hu Wenhui, deputy head of the NIPA.
For example, Gao Xiang, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and his team lowered pollution emissions from ships, and their systems have been certified by nine major global classification societies, including those in the United States and the United Kingdom. The team's systems have been applied to nearly 500 vessels of renowned shipping companies worldwide, making it the largest supplier globally in its category.
""In the first half of this year, our team's ship emission purification systems secured 40 percent of global orders in the maritime industry, with orders from overseas companies such as Mediterranean Shipping accounting for 90 percent of the total,"" said Gao, who is dean of Zhejiang University's School of Energy Engineering.
He said he believes that this not only promotes the development of clean and low-carbon ship technologies worldwide but also provides crucial technological support for China to become a leading nation in ship manufacturing and green shipping.
Seizing the opportunities created by the green and high-tech transition has long been regarded by President Xi as the key to China achieving high-quality development.
When chairing the 36th group study session of the Political Bureau of the 19th CPC Central Committee, he said China must seize the opportunities of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, while promoting in-depth integration of emerging technologies such as the internet, big data, artificial intelligence and 5G with green and low-carbon industries.
Chinese scientists have made various such achievements, and the number of China's academic papers published in the 159 most influential journals accounted for over 30 percent of the total in 2022, surpassing the US for the first time to claim the top spot globally, according to the China Institute of Scientific and Technical Information.
Ma Yanqing, a specially appointed professor at the School of Physics at Peking University who has received the 2024 Tan Kah Kee Young Scientist Award, said, ""If everyone digs deep in their own field of interest, then viewing the scientific community as a whole, in five to 10 years, many peaks and breakthroughs are expected to emerge within this collective.""

Xi hails success of lunar mission
By Zhao Lei (China Daily) 09:59, June 26, 2024
President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message on Tuesday on the success of the Chang'e 6 mission, which for the first time brought scientifically precious samples from the moon's far side back to Earth.
On behalf of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, Xi, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the CMC, extended warm congratulations and sincere greetings to the Chang'e 6 mission headquarters and all those who participated in the historic mission.
In his message, the president noted that the Chang'e 6 probe realized the world's first sample-return endeavor from the lunar far side, marking a new milestone in China's effort to become a global power in the space industry as well as in science and technology.
""Over the past 20 years, all comrades taking part in lunar exploration programs have been upholding the spirit of the cause, continuing to climb the peak of science and technology. You have made world-class achievements and established a high-quality, efficient path for exploring the moon,"" Xi said. ""Your extraordinary feats will be enshrined in the memory of our motherland and the people.""
The president expressed the hope that those who participated in the mission would make full use of the new samples in scientific studies and keep working on deep-space explorations and other major space projects.
"" (You shall) march toward building the country into a major power in space, achieving new feats in exploring the universe and benefiting humanity, and making new contributions to Chinese modernization and national rejuvenation,"" Xi said, also encouraging the mission's participants to continue strengthening international cooperation.
Carrying the unique lunar samples, the reentry capsule of the Chang'e 6 robotic probe touched down at 2:07 pm on Tuesday on its preset landing site in Siziwang Banner in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, successfully completing a 53-day voyage that involved a host of complex and challenging maneuvers.
The reentry and landing processes started at around 1:20 pm after the mission controllers at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center uploaded high-accuracy navigation data to the orbiter-reentry capsule combination.

The capsule separated from the orbiter about 5,000 kilometers above the southern Atlantic Ocean and began to descend toward Earth.
It entered the atmosphere at around 1:41 pm at a speed of 10.9 kilometers per second, close to the second cosmic velocity, and then bounced out of the atmosphere in a maneuver to reduce its ultrafast speed.
The second cosmic velocity, also known as the escape velocity, refers to the ultrafast speed required to escape the gravitational field of a celestial body.
After a short while, the capsule reentered the atmosphere and kept gliding down. When the craft was about 10 km above ground, it released its parachutes and landed smoothly on the sandy grassland. The entire landing process was operated by the capsule itself with the help of its sensors and computers.
Shortly after touchdown, recovery personnel sent from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center arrived at the landing site in helicopters and off-road vehicles. The capsule is scheduled to be transported by an airplane to Beijing on Wednesday, where it will be opened by experts at the China Academy of Space Technology.
The samples will be taken out of the capsule and weighed before being delivered, in due course, to the National Astronomical Observatories, a subsidiary of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, according to the China National Space Administration.
The Chang'e 6 probe, representing the world's first attempt to bring samples from the far side of the moon, was launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket on May 3 from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province.
The 8.35-ton spacecraft was designed and built by the China Academy of Space Technology, a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, and consisted of four components — an orbiter, a lander, an ascender, and a reentry capsule.
After a host of sophisticated steps, the lander touched down at the South Pole-Aitken Basin, one of the largest-known impact craters in the solar system, on the morning of June 2. The landing marked the second time a spacecraft ever arrived on the lunar far side.
The vast region had never been reached by any spacecraft until January 2019, when the Chang'e 4 probe landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The Chang'e 4 surveyed areas surrounding its landing site, but did not collect and send back lunar samples.
The Chang'e 6 lander worked for 49 hours on the moon's far side, using a mechanical arm and a drill to collect surface and underground materials. Meanwhile, several items of scientific equipment were activated to conduct survey and analysis assignments. After the tasks were completed, the sample-loaded ascender lifted off from the lunar surface and reached lunar orbit to dock with the reentry capsule and transfer the samples. In the final leg of the mission, the orbiter-reentry capsule combination flew back to the Earth's orbit, before separating on Tuesday.
The landscapes and physical characteristics of the lunar far side, which permanently faces away from Earth, are very different from those of the near side, which is visible from Earth, according to scientists. The new samples are expected to offer researchers around the globe useful clues to answer questions related to the moon, and will likely bring a range of invaluable scientific payoffs, they said.

Profile: Li Deren, trailblazer of China's remote sensing technology
 (Xinhua) 09:59, June 26, 2024
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese photogrammetry and remote sensing expert Li Deren, one of the two laureates for the country's top sci-tech award for the year 2023 unveiled on Monday, has devoted his life to advancing China's capabilities in surveying and remote sensing for Earth observation.
Born in 1939 in east China's Jiangsu Province, Li later enrolled at a Wuhan-based college in 1957, majoring in photogrammetry and remote sensing.
Recognizing China's urgent need for surveying and mapping technology, Li aligned his personal goals with the country's development goals and pursued further studies abroad in Germany in 1982.
During his stay in Germany, Li worked more than ten hours daily, taking two years to complete studies that would typically take five to six years.
He introduced the iteration method with variable weights, also called ""Li Deren Method"", to deal with systematic errors, which garnered significant attention in the academic community.
Upon earning his doctorate by the end of February 1985, Li promptly returned to China, declining multiple job offers from foreign research institutions but joined his alma mater in early March.
""No matter how good my personal life might be, without a strong nation, I would still face disrespect,"" Li said.
UNFORGETTABLE REGRET
A catastrophic earthquake struck Wenchuan County in southwest China's Sichuan Province in May 2008, exposing the country's inadequate satellite infrastructure for rapid post-disaster information acquisition.
Li, upset about the delay in satellite data, blamed himself for his incompetence in speeding up his research in remote sensing.
Determined to rectify this, Li intensified efforts to bolster China's satellite network, leading to significant advancements in Earth observation capabilities over the past decade.
His team's efforts have significantly advanced China's satellite imaging capabilities for civilian applications, achieving a resolution of 0.5 meters and reducing the processing time for remote sensing data from hours to mere eight minutes. These advancements have positioned China as a global leader in this field.
During the 2023 flood season, Li's team utilized the ""Luojia-2"" satellite to identify a breached dike in Hebei Province, enabling timely evacuation and saving over 6,400 lives.
Li said on China's Space Day in April this year that the country's satellite remote sensing technology capabilities has come a long way from its nascent stages to a position of excellence. It has now reached a mature level featuring self-reliance, security, and reliability.
""China's remote sensing services will not only fulfill domestic needs but also serve the global community,"" he added.
GREATEST JOY
When Li came back to China after finishing overseas study, the country's photogrammetry and remote sensing sector faced foundational challenges and a shortage of talent. Li tackled these issues starting with the compilation of teaching materials for higher education.
""Teaching brings me the greatest joy in life, and nurturing talents from one generation to the next brings our country new hope,"" noted Li.
Despite his numerous achievements, Li has kept delivering regular lectures to college freshmen with classrooms consistently filled.
He always encourages his students to think critically and face challenges with courage. He has so far mentored over 100 PhD graduates, many of whom are making significant impacts in the fields of photogrammetry and remote sensing and beyond.
Gong Jianya, a former student of Li's and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has led the development of the Wuhan-1 satellite, which was launched in May and has a panchromatic imaging resolution of 0.5 meters.
Li plans to donate all eight million yuan (about 1.1 million U.S. dollars) of the top sci-tech award money to support the cultivation of innovative talents.
""My duty is to impart knowledge,"" he said, ""seeing my students make significant contributions is my greatest achievement.""

Drones have been used in some local power grids in Northwest China for inspections, addressing the problems of blind spots and the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of high-altitude equipment inspections.
On June 20, State Grid Ningdong Electric Power Supply Company used drones for the first time to inspect high-altitude equipment such as the 330 kV Subujing substation's gantry framework, suspension insulators, and drain clamps.
""Pay close attention to the drone remote control screen and focus on inspecting the 330 kV framework, fittings, clamps, porcelain insulators, and the entire station's arresters to avoid missing any minor issues,"" said the on-site drone operator.
In the traditional manual inspection mode, inspectors needed to use auxiliary tools such as binoculars and aerial work vehicles to inspect high-altitude equipment. This method had issues with incomplete observation angles, high safety risks, and inaccurate precision. To address these ""blind spots,"" State Grid Ningdong Electric Power Supply Company innovatively used drones for detailed high-altitude inspections of new substations.
With the ultra-high-definition shooting capability of drones, they focused on inspecting the main transformer area, equipment clamps, outgoing suspension, and the upper-layer equipment of the entire station's framework, conducting precise analysis and qualitative recording of equipment status.
This greatly enhances inspection visibility, compensates for the shortcomings of traditional inspection methods, reduces the risks associated with high-altitude equipment inspections, and promptly identifies defects, the Global Times learned from the company.
To date, drones have completed the inspection of 330 kV and 110 kV equipment as well as two main transformers, identifying 13 defects that were promptly addressed through closed-loop management, ensuring the safe and efficient completion of inspection work and improving construction quality.
The company vowed to continue to be guided by ""intelligence, real-time, and lean"" principles, accelerating the transformation of intelligent operation and inspection models. While ensuring intrinsic safety, the company will deeply promote the effective integration of digital technology with power grid equipment management, comprehensively advancing the construction of modern equipment management systems and capabilities.

China's Chang'e-6 brings back first samples from moon's far side to Earth,2024-06-25,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0625/c90000-20185347.html,"Home>>
		
China's Chang'e-6 brings back first samples from moon's far side to Earth
 (Xinhua) 14:27, June 25, 2024
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The returner of the Chang'e-6 lunar probe on Tuesday brought back samples collected from the moon's far side for the first time in human history, marking another milestone in China's space exploration endeavors.
The return capsule landed precisely in the designated area in Siziwang Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region at 2:07 p.m. (Beijing Time), operating normally. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) declared the mission ""a complete success.""

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday extended congratulations on the complete success of the Chang'e-6 mission. He called for meticulous research on the lunar samples, the continued implementation of the country's major space projects, including deep space exploration, and enhancement of international exchanges and cooperation.
He also urged efforts to make new contributions to revealing the mysteries of the universe, to promoting the well-being of humanity, and to building a great country and advancing national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernization.
Under ground control, the returner separated from the orbiter approximately 5,000 km above the South Atlantic.
The capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere at about 1:41 p.m. at an altitude of about 120 km and a speed of nearly 11.2 km per second.
After aerodynamic deceleration, it skipped out of the atmosphere and then glided downwards, before re-entering the atmosphere and decelerating for a second time.
At around 10 km above the ground, a parachute opened, and the returner later landed precisely and smoothly in the predetermined area, where it was recovered by a search team.

Chang'e-6 is so far the most complicated mission in China's lunar exploration program, and its control difficulty is extremely high, said Peng Deyun, an engineer at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center.
Although the whole process of the spacecraft's re-entry into the atmosphere was quite challenging, the recovery of the returner went on smoothly, Peng said.
The returner is set to be airlifted to Beijing for opening, and the lunar samples will be transferred to a team of scientists for subsequent storage, analysis and study, said the CNSA.
""After the lunar samples are delivered to the laboratory, we will first unseal the sample container, extract the samples, and separate the samples collected on the lunar surface from those drilled under the surface,"" said Wang Qiong, deputy chief designer of the Chang'e-6 mission.
""A portion of the samples will be stored permanently, while another portion will be stored at a different location as backup in case of disasters. Then we will prepare the remaining portion, and distribute them to scientists in China and foreign countries in accordance with the lunar sample management regulations,"" he said.
Consisting of an orbiter, a returner, a lander and an ascender, the Chang'e-6 spacecraft was launched on May 3, and has gone through various stages such as Earth-moon transfer, near-moon braking, lunar orbiting and separation of the lander-ascender combination and the orbiter-returner combination.

Supported by the Queqiao-2 relay satellite, the lander-ascender combination landed at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin on the far side of the moon on June 2 and carried out sampling work.
On June 4, the ascender took off from the moon with samples and entered the lunar orbit. On June 6, it completed rendezvous and docking with the orbiter-returner combination and transferred samples to the returner. The ascender then separated from the combination and landed on the moon under ground control to avoid becoming space junk.
The orbiter-returner combination spent 13 days in lunar orbit, awaiting the right opportunity to return to Earth. After completing two moon-Earth transfer maneuvers and one orbital correction, the returner separated from the orbiter and eventually delivered the samples to Earth.
Following its contribution to the Chang'e-6 mission, the Queqiao-2 relay satellite will choose appropriate times to carry out scientific detection work. Its payloads, including an extreme ultraviolet camera, an array neutral atom imager and an Earth-moon very long baseline interferometry experiment system, will collect scientific data from the moon and deep space.
""The Chang'e-6 mission represents a significant milestone in the history of human lunar exploration, and it will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of lunar evolution,"" said Yang Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
""New samples will inevitably lead to new discoveries. Fascination with the moon is rooted in Chinese culture down the ages, as evidenced by the mythological narrative of Chang'e, a lady who journeyed to and resided on the moon. Now, Chinese scientists are eagerly anticipating the opportunity to contribute to lunar science,"" Yang added.

Lunar samples brought by the earlier Chang'e-5 mission have already drawn applications for access from international scholars, with the process well underway. The Chang'e-6 lunar probe carried four international payloads that were developed jointly by Chinese and foreign scientists. It is conceivable that the openness of Chinese lunar exploration activities will be mirrored in the study of Chang'e-6 lunar samples, said Yang.
The lunar scientific community and the entire humankind are anticipated to reap the rewards of collaborative efforts undertaken by international scientists from a wide range of geographical and disciplinary backgrounds, Yang added.
Zhang Kejian, head of the CNSA, said that exploring the vast universe is a common dream for all of humanity, and only open cooperation is the right path. China's space endeavors will adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, peaceful utilization, and inclusive development.
""We will continue to embrace openness and expand international cooperation channels. We will organize and carry out future major projects and missions, striving to expand human understanding and improve the well-being of humanity,"" he added.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese physicist Xue Qikun, winner of the country's top sci-tech award for the year 2023 unveiled on Monday, has dedicated his entire career to fundamental research in materials physics.
Born in 1963, Xue grew up in a mountainous area in east China's Shandong Province. After studying and working in Japan and the United States for eight years, he returned to China in 1999.
While working at Tsinghua University in Beijing, Xue started to focus on the quantum anomalous Hall effect, which would contribute to the development of low-power consumption electronics if verified. However, at that point, no one had yet observed it in a laboratory setting.
Xue and his team were uncertain about the outcomes when they started the experiments. He likened it to racing on an unmarked course without any clear guidance.
His team worked tirelessly over four years. They prepared and measured over 1,000 samples, and overcame a series of scientific challenges. ""Whoever makes a breakthrough first will gain an advantage in subsequent research and applications,"" Xue said.
One night in October 2012, Xue received a text message from his team that they had successfully observed the trace of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the lab.
They published their findings in the journal Science in 2013. Nobel laureate Yang Chen-ning called it ""the first physics paper of Nobel Prize level published by a Chinese lab."" The observation achievement won him the 2024 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Physics Prize.
""When major scientific opportunities emerge, we must seize them to strive for pioneering original achievements, thereby propelling the continuous advancement of our country's sci-tech level,"" Xue said.
He also seized another significant scientific opportunity in the field of high-temperature superconductivity.
After years of dedicated research, in 2012, Xue and his team made the groundbreaking discovery of interface-enhanced high-temperature superconductivity.
It reached the highest transition temperature under normal pressure since the discovery of cuprate high-temperature superconductors in 1986. This breakthrough opened up a new direction of research in the field of high-temperature superconductivity, and prompted extensive follow-up research both domestically and abroad.
""We have caught up with the golden age of scientific research. Now that the country has provided us with such excellent research conditions, we should cherish them and strive to achieve more 'zero-to-one' breakthroughs,"" Xue said.
Xue spends most of his time in his office or the laboratory. To learn as many advanced experimental techniques as possible, he would arrive at the laboratory almost every day at 7 a.m. and leave at 11 p.m. This routine has continued ever since he returned to China.
His unwavering perseverance profoundly influences the younger generation. He often encourages young researchers that achieving success in scientific research relies on one percent talent and 99 percent hard work.
When encountering bottlenecks in experiments, he enthusiastically cheers on his team and works together with them to find solutions. He also points out valuable research directions for them and encourages them to explore bravely.
Today, Xue continues to be at the forefront of scientific research, leading his team in tackling cutting-edge scientific challenges such as the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, the application of high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect and the topological quantum states, and the realization of topological quantum computing.
Looking ahead, Xue is brimming with confidence. ""China will undoubtedly make significant contributions to the next wave of the global sci-tech revolution,"" he said.

China emerges in foreground of basic sciences, fostering global collaborations
 (Xinhua) 09:50, June 25, 2024
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Xue Qikun, a top-tier physicist in China, has earned the moniker ""7-11 Professor"" from his colleagues due to his rigorous work schedule, starting his day in the lab at 7 a.m. and not leaving until 11 p.m.
His groundbreaking work in uncovering the quantum anomalous Hall effect, a pivotal discovery with the promise to revolutionize the development of next-generation electronic devices, has earned him the prestigious 2024 Oliver E. Buckley Prize, and China's top sci-tech award for year 2023.
Xue's team and a counterpart from Stanford University published their landmark finding in 2013, which Yang Zhenning, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, called ""the first physics paper of Nobel Prize level published by a Chinese lab.""
Xue is part of the over six million full-time equivalent researchers and developers in China, which constitutes the largest R&D workforce globally, according to a survey published last December.
China is firmly on the fast track to take a leading role in basic science researches, and it is embracing more global collaborations as well.
The country gained its scientific prowess almost in one generation. The Nature Index, an esteemed indicator for national sci-tech strength, showed that seven out of the ten leading institutions in 2024 are based in China. In 2015, the first year the rankings were published, the Chinese Academy of Sciences was the only Chinese institution in the top ten.
The progress indicates ""how the capacity of Chinese research institutions to produce high-quality science is moving from strength to strength,"" wrote the journal Nature's editorial.
It comes as a result of the country's strategic endeavors to bolster a forward-looking, strategic, and systematic framework for the advancement of fundamental research. Particularly, large-scale scientific installations and grand scientific projects are the pivotal drivers that China employs to advance the frontiers of science.
On the western outskirts of Beijing, a marvel of modern science unfolds: A sophisticated accelerator complex, spanning an impressive 57,500 square meters, is operating at its full capacity to probe the depths of the cosmos at a microscopic level.
Utilizing this experimental facility, Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC), an international consortium hailing from 16 countries in 80 institutions has identified a glueball-like particle, a remarkable finding that could deepen our understanding on the enigmatic frontier of fundamental physics and shed new light on the very fabric of the universe.
Located in the northern suburbs of Beijing, the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is poised to emit its first beam of light, a trillion times brighter than the sun, by the end of the year, becoming one of the brightest fourth-generation synchrotron radiation facilities worldwide.
The new facility, a successor to the BEPC and another one in Shanghai, is designed to unleash X-rays that can pierce through the molecular and atomic lattices to illuminate the most minute and complex structures within a diverse array of samples.
HEPS is set to emerge as ""a pivotal platform for fostering international scientific collaboration and advancing fundamental scientific research,"" according its developer, the CAS.
In the southern Chinese city of Jiangmen, an underground neutrino observatory (JUNO) is being constructed with the aim of becoming operational this year. It is dedicated to unraveling one of the most profound mysteries in physics: identifying which type of neutrino, an elementary particle of the universe, possesses the greatest mass.
At JUNO's 23rd international collaboration meeting in February, attendees included an assembly of scientists from Germany, France, Italy, Russia and Belgium. The symposium was also followed by a three-day training workshop, tailored for users of distributed computing systems.
China's impressive array of major scientific infrastructure also includes FAST, the world's largest single-dish radio telescope; LHAASO, a cosmic ray observatory; LAMOST, a versatile sky survey telescope; EAST, an experiment known as the ""Chinese artificial sun;"" EarthLab, a simulator of our planet; and SECUF, a lab that specializes in creating experimental environments ranging from extreme coldness to intense magnetic fields and high pressures.
All these state-of-the-art facilities are open to international scientists, reflecting the nation's pledge to enhance the accessibility of its sci-tech initiatives to the global community.
China ranked the second-largest nation, following the United States, in taking part in international cooperation, according to the Nature Index.
On Saturday, China launched an astronomical satellite, the result of nearly 20 years of hard work between Chinese and French scientists, to capture gamma-ray bursts which flicker like fireworks in the farthest reaches of the universe.
""We are living in the golden era of scientific research,"" said Xue. ""We are committed to achieving more groundbreaking 'zero to one' innovations.""

Researchers find natural few-layer graphene in Chang'e-5 lunar soil samples,2024-06-25,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0625/c90000-20185189.html,"Home>>
		
Researchers find natural few-layer graphene in Chang'e-5 lunar soil samples
 (Xinhua) 09:16, June 25, 2024
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have for the first time discovered natural few-layer graphene in the lunar soil samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission, following observation and analysis of the samples.
The study, jointly conducted by researchers from Jilin University, the Institute of Metal Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's deep space exploration laboratory, and the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the China National Space Administration, was published in the journal National Science Review.
Graphene plays an increasingly important role in extensive areas, including planetary and space science. It is estimated that graphene makes up about 1.9 percent of total interstellar carbon. The composition and structure characterization of natural graphene therefore can provide rich information on the geologic evolution of parent bodies.
Researchers used the correlative Scanning Electron Microscope/Raman technique to collect Raman spectra in several spots with relatively high carbon content in the lunar soil samples, confirming that the crystalline quality of the graphite carbon in the samples is relatively high.
They also explored and confirmed that the graphite carbon detected in the samples is few-layer graphene, reaching this conclusion through the comprehensive application of various characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, along with rigorous comparative analysis of test results from multiple perspectives.
The study offers new insights into the geological activities and evolutionary history of the moon, as well as its environmental characteristics. It also broadens understanding of the complex mineral composition of lunar soil, and provides important information and clues for the in-situ utilization of lunar resources.
In addition, researchers proposed that the formation of few-layer graphene and graphite carbon may stem from a mineral catalysis process jointly induced by the solar wind and early volcanic eruptions on the moon.

Chinese researchers have recently discovered a naturally occurring few-layer graphene for the first time in the lunar samples brought back by the Chang’e-5 probe, which provides new insights into the moon’s geological activities, evolutionary history, and environmental characteristics, broadening understanding of the complex mineral composition of lunar soil and offering important information and clues for resource utilization on the moon.
According to the research team from Jilin University, it is estimated that approximately 1.9 percent of the total interstellar carbon exists in the form of graphene, whose morphology and properties are determined by a specific formation process. Therefore, natural graphene can provide important reference and information for the geological evolution of celestial bodies and the in-situ resource utilization on the moon.
The research team collected Raman spectra, which are used to investigate lunar soils, from areas of the lunar samples with relatively high carbon content, and confirmed that the crystallization quality of the graphite carbon in the lunar samples is relatively high.
The researchers found that areas of the lunar soil samples containing carbon also contain iron compounds, which the researchers believe is closely related to the formation of graphene.
Through observation and analysis, the research team confirmed that the graphite form of carbon detected in the lunar soil samples is a type of few-layer graphene.
The research team confirmed that the formation of few-layer graphene and graphite carbon may originate from mineral catalytic processes induced jointly by the solar wind and early volcanic eruptions on the moon.
The research conducted by the researchers from Jilin University and the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and supported by China National Space Administration Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center, has recently been published in the National Science Review, a peer-reviewed journal aimed at reporting cutting-edge developments across science and technology in China and around the world.
A total of 1,731 grams of lunar samples were brought back by Chang’e-5 mission in December 2020. These samples were the first ever obtained from a younger region of the lunar surface which contains volcanic rocks. They are also the first extraterrestrial celestial bodies' samples brought back to Earth by Chinese scientists.
As of early June this year, a total of 258 lunar samples weighing 77.7 grams have been collected by Chang’e-5 and have been distributed to 114 research teams from 40 research institutions. Researchers studying these lunar samples have accomplished a number of milestone achievements with over 70 findings being published in major academic journals both at home and abroad.

Xu said in an interview with China News Service that his research team has discovered a new species of perleidid fish in nodular limestones dating back around 249 million years, at the junction of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces recently.
Named “Teffichthys wui,” this small marine carnivorous fish measures about 11 centimeters in length. The team found six fossil specimens, four from Jiangsu and two from Anhui, all preserved in nodular form. The discovery was published online in Vertebrata PalAsiatica, a professional academic journal, offering new insights into the early evolution and classification of perleidid fish.
