Lawmakers and political advisors brainstorm to seize opportunity for AI growth
By Liu Caiyu (Global Times) 09:27, January 29, 2024
Recognizing the immense potential of artificial intelligence (AI), Chinese provincial lawmakers and political advisors are actively brainstorming innovative ideas to seize the opportunity for growth in the AI sector in their respective provinces.
As an important driving engine for the development of the digital economy, the role of AI in empowering ""thousands of industries"" is also becoming more prominent. Chinese security company 360 Security Technology's founder and chairman Zhou Hongyi had predicted that in 2024, the open-source large model will undergo a transformative shift, becoming more accessible and affordable for everyone.
In Beijing, Wu Wenyan, a member from the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) submitted a proposal on the application of AI robots in the field of elderly care as China has entered into the aging society. She said the AI robots can follow instructions and provide services such as food assistance, medical assistance and mobility assistance 24 hours a day to improve the quality of life of the elderly.
In Shenzhen, Xia Jun, a CPPCC member believes that traditional Chinese medicine has the characteristics of high quality and high price, and if it is combined with AI, it is expected to better reach the balance of cost and utility. ""The final output of Chinese medicine is not standardized enough due to factors such as planting environment and policies. The use of modern technology would put the whole process of Chinese herbal medicine cultivation into supervision, to ensure the quality of drugs.""
In Shanghai, Jiang Biyan, a CPPCC member, emphasized the need for Shanghai to spearhead educational reform in the era of AI. Jiang suggests shifting the focus from imparting knowledge to fostering students' abilities, and from prioritizing teacher-led instruction to prioritizing student-centered learning. Additionally, she proposes moving away from evaluating students based solely on their knowledge mastery level, and instead, evaluating them based on their core qualities.
Zhou told the Global Times that China possesses the most extensive range of industries globally, encompassing a complete supply chain and industrial network. The most promising prospects can be found in the industrialization, specialization and vertical integration of technology.
To seize the opportunity to excel in the AI development, lawmakers and political advisors also provided suggestions on how their respective provinces can achieve their goal.
Xu Li, a member of the Shanghai Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), also the CEO of SenseTime, said Shanghai has many first-mover advantages, including various scenarios and vertical fields, as well as relatively good progress in basic and engineering sciences. Therefore, when making innovative breakthroughs, Shanghai can deviate from the Western path and instead focus on combining highly specific scenarios and data to refine end-to-end breakthroughs in large-scale models.
Guo Zhendong, a CPPCC member from East China's Shandong Province, admitted that compared to domestic pioneers like Shenzhen and Shanghai in terms of empowering the private sectors with AI, Shandong still has certain gaps though the province is a strong manufacturing base. He suggested local departments jointly research and formulate relevant documents for AI development, establish a good working mechanism and coordinate the development of the AI industry.
Shen Teng, a CPPCC member from Beijing, focused his attention on legal issues relating to AI. He suggested Beijing formulating a regulation on the promotion of the development of AI industry as soon as possible so as to establish a sound legal protection system, which he believed would provide clear legal guidance for the application of AI technology and industrial development.
On how to help Shenzhen narrow the gap in the AI sector with the Yangtze River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Tian Jiajun, a CPPCC member, said that collaborative development between Shenzhen and Hong Kong is expected to accelerate the establishment of the regional AI ecosystem.
Tian said that Shenzhen's role in leading the AI industry is relatively weak in terms of basic research areas. Hong Kong adjacent to Shenzhen has significant advantages in cutting-edge research and high-end talent cultivation in the field of artificial intelligence, which can complement Shenzhen.
Liu Gang, director of Economic Research Institute of Nankai University, believes that accelerating the implementation of application scenarios of AI, gathering innovative resources, receiving support from local government policies are crucial factors that influence and determine the development and enhancement of competitiveness in the regional AI industry. Cultivating a highly open industrial innovation ecosystem also plays a significant role in this regard.
According to a report on the Regional Competitiveness Evaluation Index of China's New Generation Artificial Intelligence Technology Industry in 2023 released in May 2023, in terms of the overall evaluation index of regional competitiveness in the country's AI technology industry in 2023, the top 10 provincial-level regions are Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, Liaoning, Anhui, and Hunan.

Technology empowers marine ecosystem protection in China
 (Xinhua) 15:57, January 27, 2024
XIAMEN, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, the coastal city of Xiamen in east China's Fujian Province has drawn on technological innovation to enhance the protection of its nearby sea areas.
At a marine environment management station of Xiamen's environmental hygiene center, the main screen displayed a comprehensive digital map of the city and its nearby sea areas. The map depicted many red and green arrows constantly shifting and creating trails minute by minute.
""These arrows indicate the possible routes of ocean trash,"" said Zhang Lianghua, director of the station. He explained that the detection and collection of ocean trash became more efficient thanks to the newly developed intelligent marine hygiene platform.
The platform, developed by Xiamen University for the station, was put to use in 2022. Liang noted that the platform features an algorithm for ocean garbage forecasts, which takes multiple factors into consideration, such as weather conditions and water dynamics.
""In accordance with the estimated route of the trash, we can dispatch our cleaning teams to intercept it in time,"" said Liang, adding that after the job is done, field data will be compared with the statistics provided by the platform, the results of which will be used to improve the algorithm's accuracy.
The station is now working closely with Xiamen University to develop a function for identifying different types of ocean trash for the platform, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, Liang said.
Apart from improving the environment of sea areas, technological advancement has also improved the city's capability of marine life preservation, especially some endangered species.
At a national-level nature reserve for rare marine species in Xiamen, an extensive system has been set up to monitor the activities of Chinese white dolphins, a species under first-class protection in China. According to Cai Libo, an official with the reserve, the system is equipped with cameras, hydrophones and drones, and patrol teams are routinely deployed for effective monitoring and management.
""Through this system, we can easily pinpoint the whereabouts of Chinese white dolphins,"" said Cai. ""For instance, during important periods, such as their breeding period, we can quickly locate their area of activities, and notify vessels to avoid these areas.""
With the help of the system, the reserve can more efficiently track the dolphins and respond to emergencies. Over the years, it has seen steady growth in its white dolphin population.

Chinese scientists develop probe for brain oxygen monitoring
 (Xinhua) 16:10, January 26, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a miniature probe that is wireless and dynamically tracks oxygen levels in the deep brain, providing a promising tool for brain disease monitoring.
The implantable probe, about 300 microns in diameter, comprises a light-emitting diode and a photodetector, and is coated with a phosphorescent film highly sensitive to oxygen, according to the findings published in the journal Nature Photonics this week.
The probe works by emitting phosphorescence and measuring the oxygen levels according to the light brightness, which would decrease with the rise of the oxygen partial pressure, a key indicator reflecting brain oxygen levels, said Sheng Xing, one of the paper's corresponding authors and an associate professor at Tsinghua University.
""When a hypoxia in brain tissue happens, the probe would emit a strong light,"" he added, noting that its response time is only less than one second.
The wireless probe has been confirmed efficient after continuously monitoring the oxygen partial pressure in the deep brain of freely moving rodents, like mice. It could capture their cerebral hypoxia state in various scenarios, including an acute ischaemia.
The findings are expected to serve as a promising health care tool for patients with epilepsy, brain tumors, stroke, and intracranial trauma in the future, Sheng said.
The study was conducted by researchers from Tsinghua University in collaboration with other Chinese research institutions, including the Xuanwu Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University and the Beijing Institute of Technology.

Chinese scientists achieve breakthrough in biosynthesis of anticancer drug paclitaxel,2024-01-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0126/c90000-20127375.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists achieve breakthrough in biosynthesis of anticancer drug paclitaxel
 (Xinhua) 15:02, January 26, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have broken through the critical technological bottleneck in the biosynthesis of the anticancer drug paclitaxel, paving the way for sustainable biomanufacturing of this medicine.
The study, led by Yan Jianbin, a researcher at the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen (AGIS) under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), was published in the latest issue of the academic journal Science.
Paclitaxel, a natural anti-tumor product with an exceptionally complex and unique molecular structure, is widely used in the clinical treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers. It is the world's best-selling plant-based anticancer drug and one of the few plant-based drugs capable of controlling the growth of cancer cells, said Yan.
In nature, paclitaxel can only be extracted from the rare and endangered gymnosperm of the Taxus genus of plants. A Taxus plant grows very slowly, usually taking decades or even hundreds of years to become a big tree. In addition, the content levels of paclitaxel-like substances in Taxus plants are extremely low. All these factors posed great difficulties for the further utilization of paclitaxel, Yan said.
The research team aimed to tackle the challenge of paclitaxel biosynthesis. In 2021, Yan's group mapped out the first high-quality reference genome of Taxus mairei in the world, which provided a genomic blueprint and key candidate genes for decoding the paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway. The relevant research results were published in the journal Nature Plants.
On this basis, the research team further screened and identified the essential candidate genes and successfully discovered the most critical and previously unknown enzyme in the paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway, elucidating the mechanism of paclitaxel pharmacological structure formation and establishing a paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway.
Additionally, the key enzymes of paclitaxel biosynthesis and the reconstruction method of the synthetic route involved in the research, are of great significance in guiding the genetic breeding of Taxus and the efficient use of germplasm resources, experts said.
The elucidation of the metabolic pathway responsible for the synthesis of paclitaxel had been an unsolved problem for many years. The Chinese research group managed to fill the gaps in the paclitaxel synthesis pathway. Besides constituting a very important contribution to basic science, this development is also significant for opening the way for the more effective and cheaper synthesis of the taxol drug, as well as for the new ability to synthesize many derivatives in search of more potent anticancer drugs, said Gregory Stephanopoulos, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.
""This finding is a major breakthrough in our understanding of the biosynthesis of complex natural products, and it will enable our abilities to produce other valuable natural products at scale and thereby develop new and valuable medicines,"" said Jens Nielsen, a professor at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.
The research team found a green and sustainable paclitaxel production method that does not require the consumption of natural Taxus resources. Developing a green and environmentally friendly strategy for the biosynthesis of paclitaxel is of great significance for treating cancers in China, said Deng Zixin, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
""Chinese scientists have reached a new milestone in the field of synthetic biology after two decades of exploration. I believe that as long as we continue to focus on relevant research, we will gain a new understanding of the essence of life and new prospects for synthetic biomanufacturing,"" said Zhao Guoping, a CAS academician.

HEFEI, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have discovered a new species of gecko, which they have named Gekko kaiyai, in the Dabie Mountains in east China's Anhui Province.
The discovery was jointly made by researchers from Anhui University, Nanjing Normal University and Chengdu Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and was published in the journal Animals.
The new species was identified on the grounds of both its distinct morphological features and molecular evidence. The analysis, based on three mitochondrial DNA fragments, indicated that Gekko kaiyai forms an independent clade.
In 2022 and 2023, geckos collected in the Dabie Mountains had aroused researchers' interest due to their aggressive behavior.
""When collecting these geckos, many from the research team were bitten repeatedly by them, which we found quite intriguing, because this behavior was not common among known native species,"" said Zhang Caiwen, the first author of the article published in Animals.
The discovery of this species confirmed that there are now 87 identified species in the genus Gekko -- 22 of which can be found in China.
Located at the junction of the provinces of Anhui, Hubei and Henan, the Dabie Mountains feature a humid subtropical continental monsoon climate and a diversified environment, which provides a favorable habitat for multiple animal and plant species.

Scientists reveal rupture process of 2023 Türkiye earthquakes,2024-01-24,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0124/c90000-20126341.html,"Home>>
		
Scientists reveal rupture process of 2023 Türkiye earthquakes
 (Xinhua) 17:00, January 24, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- An international team of scientists have released their findings on the pair of destructive earthquakes that hit Türkiye and Syria in February 2023, revealing their rupture process and details of the tremor triggered by it.
As explained in the findings published in the journal Science, earthquake rupture is complex and involves multiple processes, including fault displacement and seismic wave propagation. Understanding the rupture process and how it is triggered is helpful in figuring out the steps involved in an earthquake.
A team led by two researchers of the School of Earth and Space Sciences under Peking University, namely Yue Han and Song Xiaodong, attempted to describe and simulate the circumstances surrounding these two earthquakes, with respective magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.6, that struck a vast area of the two countries and resulted in a significant death toll.
The team, in collaboration with Turkish and U.S. counterparts, used comprehensive data analysis of seismic waves, satellite positioning and radar observations to investigate the rupture process of these earthquakes.
They simulated and reconstructed a three-dimensional rupture model of seismogenic faults and analyzed the rupture speed of various fault segments to help them better understand this pair of quakes.
Seismic waves are vibrations generated by an earthquake and include primary waves and shear waves. The former travels at a higher speed of propagation, while the latter carries more energy, Yue said.
He added that when the fault rupture speed is greater than shear wave velocity, the condition is known as supershear, which can transfer energy further from the faults and produce a more destructive earthquake.
The pair of earthquakes that hit Türkiye and Syria were of similar magnitude, occurred only nine hours apart and were relatively close to each other in terms of location. Seismologists refer to such a scenario as an earthquake doublet.
The research team found that during the 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which occurred first, a supershear rupture with a propagation velocity of 4.2 km per second was initiated on a branch fault, which sent out Mach waves and triggered an initial rupture on a 300-km long major fault.
""This process is like a sonic boom generated by a supersonic aircraft,"" said Song, who is also a chair professor at Peking University and leads the national key project on big earthquakes.
He added the major fault later showed supershear and subshear ruptures in two directions at a velocity of 4 km per second and just less than 3.2 km per second, respectively. Similarly, the same two kinds of ruptures were also observed during the subsequent 7.6-magnitude quake.
Earthquakes elsewhere in the world mostly occur under the ocean, while those in Türkiye and China mainly occur on land. ""We believe these findings will also help us understand China's earthquake problems, and collection and sharing of data is critical for this purpose,"" said Yue.

Qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of information in quantum computing. One of the current most promising physical systems for quantum networks is ion trap. In such a network, the ion-photon entanglement is the basic unit, but it would affect memory qubits carrying quantum information and cause an information loss, which is known as crosstalk.
To avoid the crosstalk, two ion species are commonly used to, respectively, entangle with photons and store quantum information. However, this dual-species scheme has limitations such as high device cost for different ions and high requirements for operations.
A research team from Tsinghua University proposed a quantum network node where only a single ion species was needed, but with two types of its qubits. They published the findings recently in the journal Nature Communications.
In the findings, the same kind of ions in the quantum network node were encoded in two different hyperfine structure levels, one for entanglement with photons and the other for information storage, said Huang Yuanyuan, a team member at Tsinghua University.
Huang noted the ion-photon entanglement was generated in a typical timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, and its crosstalk on the memory qubit was verified to be negligible at the experimental precision.
The new scheme, on the premise of ensuring the effect of ion-photon entanglement and information storage, has greatly simplified the hardware system of quantum networking and taken a significant step towards its future development, said Duan Luming, the team leader at Tsinghua University.

BEIJING, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- China's hyperspectral remote-sensing satellite has been officially put into use after completing in-orbit tests, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA) on Tuesday.
The satellite is in good condition, its subsystems are functioning properly, and its performance meets all the standards as intended, said the CNSA.
The satellite, known as Gaofen-5 01A, was launched into space on Dec. 9, 2022. It can provide high-quality hyperspectral data for diverse fields, such as environmental monitoring, natural resource surveys, and climate change studies.
The satellite provides important data support for ecological environmental protection and pollution reduction work, said Zhao Jian, director of the Earth Observation System and Data Center of the CNSA.
The CNSA also released on Tuesday the application products delivered by the satellite, including global ozone column concentration monitoring map, soil moisture monitoring map, sea ice monitoring map, water quality monitoring map and other hyperspectral data images.
""These application products are an important basis for national ecological monitoring, climate change response and natural resource surveys,"" Zhao said.
The satellite runs in the sun's synchronous regression orbit, 705 kilometers above Earth.
According to the CNSA, the satellite carries payloads including a camera covering visible-to-shortwave infrared spectral range, an atmospheric trace gas differential absorption spectrometer, and a wide-range thermal infrared imaging device.
The camera covering visible-to-shortwave infrared spectral range plays an important role in water pollution control, ecological environment monitoring, mineral resources surveys, etc. It has also made new progress in the monitoring of methane anomalous emission sources.
The atmospheric trace gas differential absorption spectrometer has enabled daily dynamic monitoring of ozone, nitrogen dioxide and other pollutant gases, providing important support to global atmospheric environment monitoring and governance.
Meanwhile, the wide-range thermal infrared imaging device is used in remote sensing monitoring operations, such as straw burning monitoring, sea ice monitoring, and river and sea outfall monitoring.
With all the payloads, the satellite has achieved the global coverage of atmospheric environmental soundings once a day and global round-the-clock coverage of the land surface environment once every two days, said Zhao.
Launched in 2010, the Gaofen project has become the backbone network of China's high-resolution Earth observation system. It has promoted the construction of a national space infrastructure system integrating satellite communication, satellite remote sensing and satellite navigation.

Seasonal ""rocket chasers"" ignite aerospace tourism boom in China
By Cheng Lu, Zhao Yeping and Yuan Rui (Xinhua) 14:24, January 23, 2024
HAIKOU, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- In the hush of the night, a blaze of brilliance pierced the darkness, its fiery ascent thundering through the clouds.
On the sandy beaches, rooftops and balconies of high-rise residential buildings in Longlou, a quaint township in southern China, all eyes turned skyward, as the resounding rumble of the carrier rocket and the thunderous roar of the crowd swept over this town located in Wenchang City in the island province of Hainan.
WHERE DREAMS TAKE FLIGHT
Last week, the launch of the Long March-7 Y8 rocket, carrying the Tianzhou-7 cargo spacecraft from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, not only illuminated the night sky but also breathed life into Longlou, where the launchpad is located.
Every time a launch is scheduled, throngs of tourists embark on a journey. They fly to the provincial capital Haikou before transferring to a high-speed train bound for Wenchang and conclude the trip with a short drive of over 20 km to reach Longlou. Then, the streets here buzz with activity, with vehicles flooding in and hotels fully booked.
For 29-year-old Zhang Zuoxing, an avid astrophotographer from Guangdong Province in south China, witnessing a rocket launch is not just a visual feast; it's a multisensory experience that evokes a sense of wonder and awe.
""The rocket ascended quietly. It was a few seconds later that I heard the roaring noise. Despite the continuous cheers and screams around me, those few seconds made me feel as if I were in a vacuum. It was almost like a dream,"" Zhang said, recalling his first-ever experience of witnessing a rocket launch in 2020.
Driven by a desire to share this profound experience with more people, Zhang and his friends founded the youth travel organization ""Walking at 20"" in 2020. Since its inception, he has visited Wenchang 13 times to watch rocket launches.
This time, Zhang was accompanied by 16 fellow travelers and they watched the Long March-7 Y8 rocket from a quiet beach. ""They were very excited, and many of them had already booked the next trip with me,"" he said.
He has led over 300 individuals spanning various age groups to witness rocket launches. Seasonal rocket enthusiasts are driven by different motivations, Zhang said, noting that some are fueled by curiosity while others by a thirst for knowledge.
""Rocket chasing"" has become an addictive pursuit for Tang Muzhi, a sophomore student studying material science at Northwest Minzu University.
The recent launch of the Tianzhou-7 cargo spacecraft marked his third visit to Wenchang, with his initial experience dating back to July 2022, when he witnessed the launch of Wentian, the first lab module of China's space station.
""Seeing the massive object ascend into the sky transformed textbook descriptions into a tangible reality. At that moment, I truly understood the nation's rapid development and felt as if I was becoming a part of the current of the times,"" Tang said. ""I will never forget that big day.""
Wang Jianjun, a 70-year-old tourist, makes sure to bring his grandson to the launch site for every rocket launch. ""I aim to plant the seed of space dreams in my grandson's heart. Experiencing the space launch firsthand will undoubtedly leave a more profound impression than any words I could convey to him,"" he said.
WHAT'S BEHIND THE FRENZY
China has notched up an impressive series of achievements in the space industry, with important launches including the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System satellites, Chang'e lunar probes, and the Tianwen-1 Mars probe.
Before it became a part of the tourist circuit, Longlou Township was relatively obscure to the outside world, with the locals mainly engaged in agriculture and fisheries.
The turning point came in 2016 with the opening of the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, China's first open coastal space launch facility. Since then, Longlou has been transformed into a vibrant hub for space enthusiasts.
Rocket launches have also brought fortune to locals. In the past two years alone, the town, home to 27,000 permanent residents, has received over 1.5 million visitors.
Leveraging the space launch center and coastal tourism resources, businesses have mushroomed across Longlou. The count of hotels and bed-and-breakfast (B&B) establishments surged from five to over 50, while shops multiplied from 230 to more than 900, said Ye Sheng, deputy Party secretary of Longlou.
Last year, Zhu Ying, who runs a local B&B, invested an additional 4 million yuan (about 556,600 U.S. dollars) to renovate 14 rooms. ""Many important launch missions will be carried out in Longlou in the future, which will drive the demand for accommodation and travel services,"" Zhu said.
Xue Ce, manager of a hotel in Longlou, sustains his livelihood from the accommodation business as well by providing tourists with rooftop viewing spots. His account on Xiaohongshu, China's lifestyle-focused social media platform, has garnered thousands of followers, attesting to the growing interest in the town's burgeoning space-related tourism.
""Whenever the launch dates are announced, my rooms quickly get fully booked,"" Xue said, adding that several guests have now become his good friends.
As space tourism gains momentum, big companies are tapping into the market. According to Yang Tianliang, chairman of Hainan International Commercial Aerospace Launch Co., Ltd., there's tremendous potential in offering space tourism services to ordinary people.
To seize this opportunity, the company launched Hainan's first commercial aerospace tourism route last year, allowing visitors to explore the province's commercial space launch site, currently under construction.
Having witnessed more than 10 rocket launches himself, Zhang Zuoxing said though the initial excitement has waned, he has found a new passion in capturing the expressions of people with his camera as they watch the launch. His lens weaves stories of a blend of joy, surprise and awe of the space enthusiasts.
The spectacle of a rocket launch carries with it the ultimate goal of exploring deep space and unraveling the mysteries of the universe. This endeavor also reflects the dream of the Chinese people.
""The Chinese people's aspiration and exploration of the universe resemble a 'Long March,'"" he said. ""I am committed to helping more travelers relish the beauty of rocket launches.""

AI-driven large models showcase great application potential,2024-01-23,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0123/c90000-20125703.html,"Home>>
		
AI-driven large models showcase great application potential
 (Xinhua) 14:20, January 23, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Large models based on algorithms, computing power and big data have become the mainstream of AI development, and have continuously empowered China's economic development.
As of October 2023, 238 big models have been launched in China, according to official data. Meanwhile, an increasing number of universities, institutes and innovative enterprises are jumping on the bandwagon of AI large models.
Large language models have garnered significant attention in recent years, with a proliferation of products attracting a substantial user base based on their functionalities such as language understanding, logical reasoning, knowledge question and answer, and text generation.
China's leading AI company iFLYTEK unveiled its AI-powered large language model dubbed ""Spark Desk"" last year. The number of its users had exceeded one million just within 14 hours after it was launched.
The multitask model covers key features including AI-generated content, multi-language understanding, logical reasoning, mathematics and coding.
China's tech giant Baidu rolled out its large language model and ChatGPT-like product dubbed Ernie Bot in March, 2023. It can provide a wide range of services, such as welcome speeches, speech drafts, business plans, instructions, flow charts and mind maps, covering many aspects of work and life.
As of December 28, 2023, the user base of Ernie Bot had exceeded 100 million, making it China's first large model product to provide paid services for consumers.
The research and development (R&D) of large models represent a key focus of future scientific endeavors, albeit with high entry barriers and related challenges. Only by fully integrating into various industries, can the large models serve the real economy more effectively and achieve sustainable development.
In recent years, China's self-developed AI-driven large models have showcased great application potential in the real economy, such as smart mining, drug R&D, meteorology, government affairs, finance, intelligent manufacturing and railway management.
In the manufacturing sector, robots equipped with large models help workers improve their efficiency. In the transportation field, traffic management departments can use large models to optimize traffic flow and road conditions.
In the realm of drug R&D, large models can expedite the process of new drug research and development, and achieve highly efficient, innovative, and personalized drug design and discovery by using natural language processing, knowledge graphs, and molecular modeling.
As a deep learning model with hundreds of billions of scale parameters and complex structures, a large model has extremely high requirements for the carrying capacity and efficiency of computing power.
Many cities with strong demands for AI are increasing the supply of computing power, such as Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai, also dubbed as the ""first echelon"" of China's AI development. These cities have successively issued relevant policies to support the layout of computing power infrastructure.
According to a white paper on China's computing power development index, the intelligent computing power developed rapidly to account for 59 percent of the nation's computing power in 2023.
