Experts believe the next generation of network technology will bring industrial manufacturing to the next level.
HANNOVER, Germany, April 25 (Xinhua) -- 6G will become ""the basis for the next industrial revolution,"" a technology expert said at the globally influential Hannover Messe 2024 trade fair this week.
Frank Burkhardt, from the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS (Fraunhofer IIS), said that 6G technology means those working in factories will be able to perform tasks which are currently ""undreamed of.""
Experts believe the next generation of network technology will bring industrial manufacturing to the next level.
According to Germany's 6G Research and Innovation Cluster (6G-RIC), which showcased its progress at the trade fair, key technical innovation areas of 6G should include addressing the bandwidth limitations of existing infrastructure, and making large-scale networks able to connect a wide variety of devices.

Artificial intelligence and computing infrastructure in the network will play more critical roles in 6G, said 6G-RIC researcher Johannes Dommel at the event.
More sensors, data, and computing capabilities will be available for the industry in the next-generation network, Dommel underlined. ""I think 6G will provide the answers for the increasing trends in data and devices.""
Research engineer Marius Schmitz from the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau told Xinhua that 5G technology already offers a strong network in terms of latency, data rate, and reliability, but it cannot serve as one network for all purposes.
""In our vision, 6G could be a more versatile network that can fit into a bigger number of different applications simultaneously,"" Schmitz said.
However, it is currently unknown when 6G will be put into practical use, he added. ""The standardization process of 6G could take a long time.""
While 5G paved the way for the development of cellular communication, 6G brings it to the next level, said senior technology architect from Belden, Christian Bauer, during the trade fair.

Shenzhou-18 taikonauts start journey to space station for more sci-tech experiments,2024-04-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0426/c90000-20161902.html,"Home>>
		
Shenzhou-18 taikonauts start journey to space station for more sci-tech experiments
By Yuan Quan, Liu Xin and Quan Xiaoshu (Xinhua) 08:13, April 26, 2024
JIUQUAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday launched the Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship that will send three taikonauts to the orbiting Tiangong space station for a six-month mission.
The spaceship, atop a Long March-2F carrier rocket, blasted off at 8:59 p.m. (Beijing Time) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.
About 10 minutes after the launch, the Shenzhou-18 spaceship separated from the rocket and entered its designated orbit. The crew members are in good shape and the launch is a ""complete success,"" the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) announced.
While in orbit, the Shenzhou-18 spaceship is scheduled to make a fast, automated rendezvous and docking with the space station combination. The Shenzhou-18 crew will rotate with the Shenzhou-17 crew in orbit.
The Shenzhou-18 crew members are Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, with Ye as the mission commander.
The Shenzhou-18 mission marks Ye's second journey into space, following his previous role as a crew member during the Shenzhou-13 mission from October 2021 to April 2022. Li Cong and Li Guangsu, who belong to the third group of Chinese astronauts, are both embarking on their first-ever space adventure.

SPACE ""AQUARIUM"" AND ""GARDEN""
The crew will utilize the scientific experiment cabinets and extravehicular payloads to carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material science, space life science, space medicine and space technology, said Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA, at Wednesday's press conference.
A unique task for the three pilot-turned taikonauts is to create an ""aquarium"" and raise fish in zero gravity.
They will create a simplified version of an aquatic ecosystem using zebrafish and algae to study how the space environment affects their growth and system balance.
The ""aquarium"" is 1.25 liters in volume and can accommodate four small fish. But if the experiment succeeds, it will be a significant breakthrough to cultivate vertebrates in China's space program. Not only will the taikonauts find joy in the space ""aquarium,"" but it may also pave the way for their future counterparts to enjoy nutritious fish from their own in-orbit harvests.
""The next step in our research involves conducting experiments on fruit flies and mice,"" said Cang Huaixing, a chief researcher for the space station's scientific experiments, at the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Taikonauts in orbit will also be involved in an experiment of cultivating plants. The purpose is to analyze the changes in the function and gene expression of plant stem cells in a microgravity environment. According to scientists, this research will provide theoretical support for designing crops that can adapt to outer space conditions.
More than 100 Arabidopsis seeds will be grown and nurtured in space for approximately four weeks. The crew aboard the space station will freeze them at minus 80 degrees Celsius in real-time and bring them back to Earth for further analysis and research.
In addition to the two experiments related to fish and plant, the crew will also conduct molecular research on the co-origin of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as the origin of codons. Furthermore, they will test a newly developed spacecraft coating material.
Besides, they will complete tasks including installation of protection reinforcement devices against space debris, and installation and retrieval of extravehicular payloads and platform equipment.

FUTURE SPACE TRAVELLERS
The on-site audience include a navy officer, role models from ethnic minority areas, as well as pupils from Jishishan, a county in northwest China's Gansu Province, which was struck by a 6.2-magnitude earthquake last December.
Ma Yingbo, a primary school student from Jishishan, said he ""jumped up with excitement"" when he learned that he would have the opportunity to witness the launch.
Since arriving at the launch center, he has been actively participating in various space science courses.
He shared with Xinhua his learning journal, which said he was particularly captivated by the fascinating story of the rocket launch. In his eyes, rockets serve as a bridge connecting Earth and the space, making ancient myths no longer distant legends.
""When I grow up, I want to become a taikonaut, too. I will explore the vast universe just like them,"" he penned in his diary.
The frequent exposure given to the taikonauts at the space station has attracted more attention from the public, and China's manned space program has become more closely connected with the ordinary people.
China's first taikonaut Yang Liwei, who is the deputy chief designer of the country's manned space program, said on Wednesday, China's Space Day, that ""it is no longer a technical obstacle for ordinary people to venture into space.""
The reason why only professional taikonauts are currently flying is that there are many tasks that require their expertise during the space station's construction and operation, Yang explained.
He said that with the progress of the entire space project, in the foreseeable future, ordinary people, following a brief period of training while maintaining an optimal physical condition, will have the opportunity to venture into space ""to gaze upon our magnificent Earth home from outer space and marvel at the vastness of the universe.""

China will carry out three Chang'e lunar probe missions within next four years and the basic form of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS,) the international moon base project currently led by the China National Space Administration and Russia's ROSCOSMOS, is expected to be completed before 2035, Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration project, revealed during a speech at the ongoing China Space Conference in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province.
Wu, who is also the chief scientist and director of China's Deep Space Exploration Laboratory (DSEL,) and an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, remarked at the annual space conference to mark the Space Day of China on April 24 every year that as an important task during the basic construction phase of the ILRS, Chang'e-6 mission will be launched soon to complete a sampling mission and return from the lunar far side; Chang'e-7 is scheduled for launch around 2026 to conduct environmental and resource surveys at the lunar south pole; Chang'e-8 is planned for launch around 2028 to conduct in-situ resource utilization experiments on the moon.
In recent years, China's space technology capabilities have made significant strides, establishing major infrastructure for deep space exploration and establishing cooperation with multiple countries worldwide, all of which lay a solid foundation for the construction of the ILRS.
Following the principles of ""overall planning, step-by-step implementation, and building while using,"" the construction of the ILRS will be carried out in two phases.
By 2035, the basic version will be completed, centered around the lunar south pole, with comprehensive scientific facilities equipped with basic functions and elements, conducting regular scientific experiments and a certain scale of resource development and utilization.
By 2045, the expanded version will be completed, with the lunar orbit station as the hub, featuring fully equipped and substantially scaled facilities, stable operations, while conducting comprehensive scientific research on the moon and in-depth resource development and utilization, and conducting technical verification and scientific experiments related to a manned mission to Mars.
The ILRS consists of lunar surface, lunar orbit, and ground segments, comprising infrastructure such as energy and power systems, command and information systems, and lunar transportation systems, with functions including energy supply, central control, communication and navigation, lunar-earth transportation, and lunar surface research, enabling long-term and sustained scientific exploration, resource development, and technology verification across multiple disciplines and objectives.
The ILRS, initiated by China and Russia, is being jointly developed and constructed by multiple countries, with long-term autonomous operation on the lunar surface and in lunar orbit, with short-term human participation, as an expandable, maintainable comprehensive scientific experimental facility.
Wu also revealed that China plans to launch the Tianwen-2 mission around 2025, to carry out flyby exploration and return samples from a small asteroid located about 40 million kilometers away from Earth. Around 2030, Tianwen-3 is planned to be launched to execute a sample return mission from Mars, Wu said.
""Currently, looking at the progress of various countries around the world, our country is expected to become the first country to return samples from Mars,"" Wu remarked.
China has begun planning the construction of the world's first Mars sample laboratory and is also deepening the feasibility study of the Tianwen-4 mission, aiming for the exploration of Jupiter and its moons, followed by the arrival at Uranus, according to Wu.
""The probability of an asteroid impact on Earth is extremely low, but the consequences would be enormous,"" Wu said, noting that in history, asteroids have struck the Earth multiple times, resulting in major disasters such as the extinction of dinosaurs.
China has initiated an asteroid defense plan and is expected to implement a kinetic impact on an asteroid located tens of millions of kilometers away around 2027, altering its orbit and conducting impact assessment in orbit, aiming for precision, effectiveness, and clear evaluation, he said.
Wu disclosed that in the middle of this century, China plans to launch a new type of propulsion spacecraft, reaching the boundary of the solar system at 80-100 astronomical units (AU), conducting scientific exploration in the distant, dark, and cold unknown regions, aiming to establish new milestones in humanity's understanding of the universe.

Chinese scientists build 3D model of 3-week human embryo
 (Xinhua) 15:11, April 25, 2024
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists reconstructed a 3D model of a human embryo within two to three weeks after fertilization, which opens a new door into very early human embryonic development.
Out of ethical concerns, in-vitro culture of human embryos is limited to 14 days, and therefore, the human embryo growth between 14 and 21 days after fertilization is usually considered a ""black box.""
The researchers from the Institute of Zoology, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China Agricultural University conducted high-resolution profiling on 38,562 gene spots of a human embryo and then constructed its 3D model by integrating gene expression patterns and spatial information.
Also, they have investigated the dynamic activity of signaling pathways along the embryonic body axis, according to the study published this week in the journal Cell.
The study has far-reaching clinical implications for understanding the miscarriages and fetal disorders in early embryonic development, said the researchers.

Farm without farmers: a peek into unmanned farm in E China's Jiangsu province
By Yin Xiaoyu (People's Daily) 14:37, April 25, 2024
The spring sowing season has arrived, but in the sprawling wheat fields in Lujia township, Kunshan, east China's Jiangsu province, there wasn't a farmer in sight across the vast expanse. What could be seen was only a drone hovering above the fields.
""This is an unmanned farm. It spans 3,840 mu (256 hectares) and primarily grows rice and wheat,"" said engineer Geng Bojian, who's engaged in the R&D and regular maintenance of the farm.

Photo shows the unmanned farm in Lujia township, Kunshan, east China's Jiangsu province. (Photo from the official account of the East China Agri-Tech Center, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences on WeChat)
This intelligent farm, which features minimal management and unmanned operations, was established last year through the utilization of big data, artificial intelligence, self-organizing communication networks, and a suite of intelligent equipment such as multi-rotor drones, driverless tractors, unmanned harvesters, and smart irrigation gates, according to Geng, who's also a member of the Yangtze River Delta Academy of Smart Agriculture under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).
In recent years, Kunshan has been working to promote the digitalization of agriculture, focusing on smart agricultural machinery and intelligent farming, and striving to build relevant intelligent scenarios.
In 2021, Suzhou and the CAAS signed an agreement to jointly establish the East China Agri-Tech Center, and the unmanned farm was exactly one of the projects launched by the center.
In the unmanned farm, there is a white building - the intelligent command center, also known as the ""smart brain"" of the farm.
At the center, a young staff member was staring at a big screen displaying live video footage of the wheat fields, with relevant data constantly updating on either side.
The young staff member was performing routine field patrol with a drone.

This ""smart brain"" comprises modules for crop monitoring, agricultural machinery management, resource management, drone control, agricultural operations, intelligent irrigation, equipment alerts, and analysis and decision-making.
""In the past, a field patrol needed several people riding electric bikes to each plot, with each person inspecting hundreds of mu of land. It would take at least an hour and a half to complete the patrol,"" Geng said.
""Now, a drone can cover the entire area in half an hour while simultaneously collecting crop growth data,"" he added.
Geng said that in every plot there is a soil condition monitor, which is used to record soil temperature, moisture, and real-time water level.
""The unmanned farm employs an intelligent irrigation system. Once the monitors detect low soil moisture, the system will be activated,"" Geng told People's Daily.
Besides, a small weather monitoring station is set up in the fields, capable of real-time collection of meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. In addition, there are also devices like insect monitoring traps and spore catchers.
Shen Junjie is an employee of Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Reclamation and Development Corporation. He works with three colleagues to manage the agricultural operations of this unmanned farm. Their daily work involves collecting field data with monitoring devices and drones. Based on the data they collect, the intelligent command center would analyze crop growth and provide scientific guidance on farming practices.

""Through a mobile app, we receive notifications from the command center and can remotely assign tasks to unmanned agricultural machines,"" Shen told People's Daily.
The unmanned agricultural machines Shen mentioned were parked in a storage facility, all large in size, including cultivators, transplanters, crop sprayers, and harvesters - each equipped with the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. All the operators needed to do was to set the routes and tasks, and remotely start the machines.
""These machines weren't unmanned when they were manufactured. It was our technical team that modified them, and now each one possesses unique skills,"" Geng said.
Today, unmanned equipment is employed in the entire rice and wheat production cycle, including plowing, sowing, managing, and harvesting. The cultivators can complete fertilizing, tilling, and sowing operations all at once. The harvesters can monitor harvest quality in real time while reaping, and upload data to relevant platforms. They can even chop and spread the rice straw back into the field or pass it to a baler for organic processing. The harvested rice and wheat is transported by unmanned vehicles to the farm's drying center for automatic drying and storage.
""In another couple of months, it will be the time to harvest the winter wheat. All the agricultural machines will be in full swing, "" Geng said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a congratulatory letter to the first China-Latin American and Caribbean States Space Cooperation Forum on Wednesday, highlighted that China is ready to work with Latin American and Caribbean countries to build a high-level space cooperation partnership, promote space technology to better benefit both peoples, and continue to promote the building of a community of China and the Latin American and Caribbean countries with a shared future.
The event, co-hosted by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and Hubei provincial government, took place in Wuhan, Hubei Province on Wednesday. The forum holds great significance in inspiring space scientific innovation, deepening international space cooperation, and showcasing the high level of political trust between China and the Latin American, Caribbean countries.
Noting that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the China-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) Forum jointly announced by the leaders of the two sides, Xi said that China and Latin American and Caribbean countries have seen prosperous development over the past decade in their cooperation in various fields within the framework of the China-CELAC Forum to usher in a new era featuring equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and tangible benefits for the people, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
China is ready to work with Latin American and Caribbean countries to build a high-level space cooperation partnership, promote space technology to better benefit both peoples, and continue to promote the building of a community of China and Latin American and Caribbean countries with a shared future, Xi said.
Only with high-level political trust can the two sides carry out cooperation in the space domain, as it involves a large amount of sensitive areas in national defense technology, Pan Deng, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Region Law Center of the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
Pan said that China has mastered a full range of mature space technology, from launching spacecraft, satellite in-orbit operations to applications on the ground, while countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region have the unique geographical advantage of their location in the Earth's western and southern hemisphere, which is crucial for monitoring and tracking space activities as well as their growing need for space power building such as launching commercial satellites.
Therefore, cooperation between China and Latin America in the field of space not only helps enhance the technological innovation capabilities of both sides but also promotes social and economic development. Such cooperation, based on high-level political trust, commercial collaboration, and equal partnership, holds significant and far-reaching implications for enhancing China-Latin America relations, upgrading cooperation, fostering innovative development, and promoting the building of a community of China and Latin American and Caribbean countries with a shared future, he said.
Xi, in the letter, also said that China and Latin American and Caribbean countries have yielded fruitful results in space cooperation in recent years, including new progress in the fields of remote sensing satellites, communication satellites and the deep space station network, which has played an important role in promoting scientific and technological progress, strengthening regional connectivity and improving people's well-being.
Working together for over three decades, China and Brazil have developed six satellites under the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program (CBERS) so far, with the first successful launch in 1999. China helped launch Earth-observing satellites for Venezuela over the years, and helped Bolivia launch the country's first telecom satellite in 2013.

Capacity building for all
Wednesday marked the 2024 Space Day of China with delegates from over 50 countries' aerospace agencies, international organizations, foreign embassies and consulates in China, and research institutions attending the main event in Wuhan.
China designated April 24 as the Space Day of China in 2016 to mark the launch of its first space satellite ""Dongfanghong-1"" to space on April 24, 1970. According to statistics obtained by the Global Times from the organizers, a series of nearly 500 space-themed activities is being held by relevant departments, universities and associations across the country on April 24 this year.
China revealed on Wednesday more details of international cooperation in its lunar probe programs.
The International Lunar Research Station (ILRS,) a lunar program currently led by the CNSA and Russia's Roscosmos, has added Nicaragua, the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO), and the Arab Union for Astronomy and Space Science as collaborating countries and organizations.
The CNSA announced Wednesday that China will cooperate with these three parties in various aspects such as engineering implementation, operation and application of the ILRS program. According to the CNSA's ILRS Partnership Guidelines, the ILRS aims for peaceful use, equality and mutual benefit, and common development.
Through joint construction with multiple countries, the ILRS will establish a comprehensive scientific experiment facility on the lunar surface and in lunar orbit, capable of long-term autonomous operation, and short-term human involvement, with expandability and maintainability, the Global Times learned from the CNSA on Wednesday.
Aisha Jagirani, director general of the Department of External Relations and Legal Affairs at APSCO, told the Global Times on Wednesday that China's space program is quite impressive compared with other countries that have been working in the development of the technology for so many years. China, in a small time frame period, has done a lot, and most of the work is indigenous and totally done inside China. That is incredible, Jagirani said.
Commenting on APSCO's official joining of the ILRS program, Jagirani hailed that China now brings opportunities to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly developing countries that do not have much experience in the kind of technology or that cannot work independently.
""So through the platform, the countries have the opportunity to learn about space exploration, what research is involved, what technicalities are involved. We [APSCO] have an agreement with China on the ILRS and that provides an opportunity to the member states including small emerging countries to learn about the dynamics of a space exploration.""
""That is something extremely impressive. These kind of opportunities cannot be found anywhere else,"" she said.
Jagirani elaborated that ""the basic idea of joining the ILRS is capacity building, because we understand that not all countries in the Asia-Pacific region have ambitions to send [a] man on the moon, nor maybe have ambition or that much financial capability available to do moon exploration. But through this platform of ILRS, member states could have the capacity-building opportunity, and they're working together to get involved in the work to find out how the whole program is being developed, what research areas are available, when the lunar samples will be brought back to Earth, and how these samples are being researched.
""So it's a great opportunity to focus on training, education and capacity building of the member state so that in future, when they aim to go for space exploration, they already have experience accordingly,"" she said.
China also announced on Wednesday the Chang'e-7 mission is scheduled to launch around 2026, aiming to survey the lunar south pole's surface environment, lunar soil water ice, and volatile components. It will conduct high-precision exploration and research on lunar topography, composition, and structure.
China's Chang'e-7 mission has selected six international payloads to carry onboard, based on scientific objectives and engineering feasibility, from seven countries and international agencies including Egypt/Bahrain, Italy, Russia, Switzerland, Thailand and the International Lunar Observatory Association.
The Chang'e-7 lander will carry a laser retroreflector array developed by the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Italy's Frascati National Laboratory to support high-precision measurements on the lunar surface and orbit navigation for orbiters, a lunar dust and electric field detector developed by the Russian Space Research Institute to study the lunar exosphere's dust and plasma environment near the lunar surface, and a lunar astronomical observation telescope developed by the International Lunar Observatory Association to conduct lunar-based observations of the Milky Way, Earth, and the panoramic sky.
The orbiter will carry a lunar material hyperspectral imager jointly developed by the Egyptian Space Agency and the Bahrain National Space Science Agency for analyzing and identifying lunar material and environment, a dual-channel Earth radiation spectrometer developed by the Davos Physical Meteorological Observatory in Switzerland (World Radiation Center) and Shenzhen University for monitoring changes in the Earth's climate system radiation balance from the moon for the first time, and a space weather global monitoring sensor developed by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research, and Innovation of Thailand and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand for early warnings of disturbances caused by solar storms and cosmic radiation.

Shenzhou XVIII's post-1980 astronauts set for launch,2024-04-25,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0425/c90000-20161347.html,"Home>>
		
Shenzhou XVIII's post-1980 astronauts set for launch
By Cui Jia (Chinadaily.com.cn) 10:11, April 25, 2024
The three post-1980 generation crew members of the Shenzhou XVIII mission said on Wednesday that their similar professional backgrounds and mutual trust will help them complete all the objectives set for the mission.
The Long March 2F rocket carrying the astronauts aboard the Shen-zhou XVIII spacecraft is set to lift off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China at 8:59 pm on Thursday, Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency and spokesman for the mission, said during a news conference on Wednesday at the launch center.
The crew members are Senior Colonel Ye Guangfu, who is the mission commander, Colonel Li Cong and Colonel Li Guangsu. Ye was also a crew member of the Shen-zhou XIII mission that returned in April 2022, while Li Cong and Li Guangsu will be making their first spaceflight.
Ye, 43, said that unlike his first mission, which was full of excitement because it fulfilled his dream of becoming an astronaut, this trip will require him to bear greater responsibility as mission commander.
Nonetheless, Ye said while meeting the media at the launch center on Wednesday, ""Every mission to space is a new start.""
""Besides recovering, I also had to return to training in the past two years. And the structure of the space station is new to me and more complicated to operate. Also, leading a team is another new challenge,"" he added.
All of the crew members were trained as pilots in the People's Liberation Army Air Force and share other similarities in age and experience, said Li Cong, who is 34.
""To ensure the smooth running of the space station with complicated operation systems, all the operations must be precise, and the mutual trust of the crew members is required,"" he said.
Li Guangsu, who is 36, will be responsible for conducting experiments in space. He said he is looking forward to experiencing life in weightless conditions.
""Besides work, I also want to take a good look at the beautiful blue planet and our country. Furthermore, I want to see if the stars do twinkle, for my child,"" he added.
 
Lin, the China Manned Space Agency deputy director, said the main objectives set for the mission include the handover of the space station from the Shenzhou XVII crew and carrying out a series of experiments and missions during the new crew's six-month stay.
According to the plan, the Shenzhou XVIII crew members will return to the Dongfeng landing site in late October.
During the mission, the country's first in-orbit aquatic ecological research project will be carried out. Using goldfish algae and zebrafish to establish a self-cycling aquatic ecosystem in orbit, the aim of the project is to make a breakthrough in the cultivation of vertebrates in space, Lin said.
Cang Huaixing, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization, said the experiment could help people build aquatic ecosystems and food-producing systems in space in the future.
Besides continuing to recruit and train Chinese astronauts for upcoming space and lunar missions, China will also promote the participation of foreign astronauts and space tourists in flights to the space station, Lin said, adding that China is confident that its space station will welcome more new members from different backgrounds in the near future.
Lin also said that China's crewed lunar exploration program is progressing smoothly, with the development of major component systems, such as the Long March 10 carrier rocket, the crewed spacecraft Mengzhou, the lunar lander Lanyue and the lunar landing suit, having been completed, with prototype production and tests being carried out.
In 2023, crewed lunar exploration was approved by the central government for launch and implementation, with the aim of landing Chinese on the moon by 2030.
The plan is to launch two carrier rockets to send a crewed spacecraft and a lunar lander into lunar orbit. The spacecraft and lunar lander will dock with each other, after which the astronauts will enter the lander, Lin said.

China and Latin American countries have already engaged in long-term, comprehensive and pragmatic space cooperation, covering multiple areas such as infrastructure construction, deep space exploration and space science, space industry chain, and the global governance of outer space.
Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said at the forum's opening ceremony that long-term space collaborations between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries have been carried out in many key projects, with numerous results and great potential for future cooperation.
Yue Yunxia, director of the economic research office of the Institute of Latin American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said space cooperation between China and Latin American countries is not an empty slogan, but covers a wide range of fields.
""China-Latin America space cooperation has helped Latin American countries build their aerospace systems, train high-quality space technology personnel and achieve new breakthroughs in the aerospace field. China-Latin America cooperation on remote-sensing satellites, communication satellites and commercial space has promoted connections among Latin American countries, and improved people's well-being,"" Yue said.
WIN-WIN COOPERATION
Space cooperation between China and Argentina has become increasingly close in recent years. The two sides have cooperated on satellite navigation applications, and Argentina has provided support for China's deep-space exploration.
In 1999, the first China-Brazil earth-resource satellite was successfully launched. It was the first satellite jointly developed by China and another country.
In 2008, China launched Venezuela's first satellite -- the Venesat-1, or ""Simon Bolivar"" -- which carried communications facilities. In 2012, Venezuela's first remote-sensing satellite, the VRSS-1, was also launched into space from China. The satellite has facilitated Venezuela's land and resources census, urban planning, and disaster detection and management.
In a congratulatory letter to the forum, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said China and Venezuela have close cooperation and profound friendship in the field of aerospace sector, which is of great significance for promoting space cooperation between China and Latin America.
BENEFITING WORLD
Over the past 30 years, China and Brazil have jointly developed six earth-resource satellites. The satellite data has not only been widely applied in the fields of agriculture, water conservancy, environmental monitoring, but also provided abundant remote-sensing satellite services for developing countries in Latin America, Africa, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other regions.
Marco Antonio Chamon, president of the Brazilian Space Agency, said that Earth has been facing various challenges, such as climate change and ocean plastic pollution, which have exerted a great impact on society that no country could handle alone. Therefore, it is necessary for Latin America to cooperate with China to develop space technology and data services to solve current problems.
China-Latin America space cooperation has become an indispensable driving force for South-South cooperation, while Latin America has become one of the regions with which China has cooperated the most in space.
President of the Republic of Honduras Iris Xiomara Castro Sarmiento said in a congratulatory letter to the forum that China has been committed to carrying out space cooperation with developing countries, which can help both sides to overcome common challenges, achieve sustainable development and mitigate climate change and natural disasters.
SHARED FUTURE
Marcelo Suarez Salvia, ambassador of Argentina to China, expressed his expectations for the cooperation between China and Latin America during the forum.
""We are eager to learn more about China's space development,"" said the ambassador, adding that Argentina hopes to continuously deepen cooperation with China in various fields, especially space cooperation.
It is a common vision for China and Latin America to make proper use of space resources, conduct fair and reasonable global governance of outer space, and build a community with a shared future through space cooperation.
China-Latin America space cooperation will fully inherit the traditional friendship between China and Latin America, promote mutual benefit and the progress of space technologies and industrial capabilities of both sides, and make positive contributions to the common space-exploration cause of humanity, said Zhang.
""We will establish a long-term mechanism for cooperation and dialogue, strengthen high-level exchanges in the aerospace field, jointly plan future cooperation opportunities, and continue to implement high-quality cooperation projects that serve China and Latin America and benefit the world,"" Zhang added.

JIUQUAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu will carry out the Shenzhou-18 crewed spaceflight mission, and Ye will be the commander, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) announced at a press conference on Wednesday.
The Shenzhou-18 crewed spaceship will be launched at 8:59 p.m. Thursday (Beijing Time) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, said Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA.
After entering orbit, the Shenzhou-18 spaceship will perform a fast automated rendezvous and docking with the radial port of the space station core module Tianhe, which will take about 6.5 hours, forming a combination of three modules and three spacecraft, Lin said.

This will be the second space flight mission for Ye Guangfu who was a crew member of the Shenzhou-13 mission from October 2021 to April 2022. Li Cong and Li Guangsu, among the third batch of Chinese astronauts, are both newcomers to space.
""My two crew members and I, as well as the entire space mission team, are fully prepared and confident to complete this space flight mission,"" Ye told journalists on Wednesday ahead of the launch.
All the three Shenzhou-18 astronauts are from the post-1980s generation. At the press conference, they said they would take good care of the Tiangong space station and make more achievements in the space laboratory.

UNIVERSAL EXPECTATIONS
Ye, a 43-year-old space returnee, will lead his team in conducting a series of challenging tasks in microgravity.
""Returning to space also feels like a fresh start,"" Ye said. In comparison to his previous mission, the current space station features a more complex structure, demanding tasks and greater operational challenges. But Ye said the new crew is brimming with confidence.
During the Shenzhou-13 mission, the ground team assisted Ye in exchanging friendly greetings with a foreign counterpart through email.
""We two astronauts, one on the Chinese space station and the other on the International Space Station, shared our dreams of exploring the vast universe together,"" Ye recalled.
The first Chinese astronaut to participate in multinational training, Ye has also extended invitations to international counterparts to visit China's space station. ""We extend our warmest invitation to international colleagues to join us in exploring its vast potential and working towards benefiting all humankind,"" he said.
""We have made comprehensive, systematic and in-depth preparations for this mission, focusing on extravehicular activities (EVAs), emergency response, space station management, equipment maintenance and experimental operation,"" Li Cong, the youngest member of the Shenzhou-18 crew, told the media on Wednesday.
During the Shenzhou-18 mission, the main jobs of crew member Li Guangsu will be space experiments and tests in the cutting-edge fields such as aerospace medicine, basic physics, material science and life science.
""I am looking forward to the speed and passion of 7.9 kilometers per second, the special experience of weightlessness, and the wonderful feeling of flying without wings,"" said Li Guangsu.

TASKS AHEAD
The crew will stay in orbit for about six months, and they will witness the arrival of the Tianzhou-8 cargo craft and Shenzhou-19 crewed spaceship during their stay, Lin said.
The crew will utilize the scientific experiment cabinets and extravehicular payloads to carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material science, space life science, space medicine and space technology, Lin said.
The country's first in-orbit aquatic ecological research project will also be implemented during the mission. Using zebrafish and goldfish algae to establish a self-cycling aquatic ecosystem in orbit, the project aims to make to a breakthrough in the cultivation of vertebrates in space, Lin noted.
The world's first in-orbit stem cell study on the plant's stem tips will be made to explore plant evolutionary adaptation to gravity and provide theoretical support for space cropping, said Lin.
The Shenzhou-18 astronauts will carry out two to three EVAs, implement six cargo outbound deliveries via the station's cargo airlock module.
During the EVAs, the astronauts will install space debris protection reinforcements for extravehicular piping, cables and critical equipment, and carry out extravehicular inspections, as appropriate, to further ensure the safety of the space station, Lin said.
The Shenzhou-18 crew are scheduled to return to the Dongfeng landing site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in late October this year.

GUIYANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have discovered a new Asteraceae species, which has been named Ixeridium malingheense, in the Maling River Canyon of Xingyi Geopark in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
The research findings were published in a recent edition of the international academic journal Phytotaxa.
""During a field survey in the Maling River Canyon in March 2023, we first spotted this new species,"" said Li Zhi, a member of the research team who is from the college of forestry at Guizhou University.
The new species only grows on limestone near water in high-altitude mountains in the canyon. After a detailed morphological comparison, the researchers concluded that it represented a new taxon that has not been reported to the scientific community.
Featuring rugged terrain and steep valleys, the Maling River Canyon is rich in complex Karst landscape and flora. In recent years, several previously unknown species have been discovered in the area.
