China completes construction of gigantic space weather monitoring radio telescope
 (Xinhua) 09:50, May 13, 2024
HOHHOT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's first gigantic radio telescope dedicated to observing interplanetary scintillation phenomena passed its technical testing process on Friday.
The telescope, located in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, will be applied to monitor interplanetary space weather on a daily basis to provide high-quality data for both China's and international space weather forecasting.
Radio waves radiated from compact celestial objects outside the Milky Way can be scattered by the irregular micro-structures of solar wind turbulence as they propagate through interplanetary space, resulting in random fluctuations in the radio flux observed on Earth. Such a phenomenon is called interplanetary scintillation.
Notably, interplanetary scintillation can be used to track interplanetary propagation caused by solar storms.
""Monitoring interplanetary scintillation can be useful for the reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure of a large-scale solar wind, which is helpful in revealing the correlation between solar eruptive activities and geospace environment changes,"" said Yan Yihua, a researcher from the National Space Science Center (NSSC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The development of the above-mentioned telescope project was led by the NSSC, and this telescope is one of the key facilities within the mega-framework of the Phase-2 Meridian Space Weather Monitoring Project in China.
Interplanetary scintillation observation can help reduce or avoid the harmful impact of disastrous space weather events on aviation, aerospace, communications, navigation and grid operation.

Glasses in Moon's soil preserve water from multiple sources: study
 (Xinhua) 14:17, May 11, 2024
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that glassy materials within the lunar soil samples, which were brought back by the country's Chang'e-5 lunar exploration mission, contain hydroxyl and molecular water generated from a variety of sources.
The study published on Saturday in the journal Science Advances revealed that the glass in the lunar soil created by meteorites or micrometeorites impacts is the primary carrier of molecular water in lunar soil.
The researchers from the Institute of Geochemistry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed nearly 100 samples of impact glass collected during the Chang'e-5 mission and identified 12 grains that were found to contain hydroxyl and molecular water.
The water was found to have originated from multiple potential sources including proton implantation from solar wind, the delivery of water-rich meteorites or micrometeorites, and water native to the Moon, according to the study.
Notably, the primary contributor to this water is solar wind implantation, highlighting its significant role in the formation of lunar water.
The findings could help researchers understand the sources and storage pathways for water during the development of terrestrial planets, said Tang Hong, the paper's corresponding author.
The Chang'e-5 probe, which returned to Earth on Dec. 17, 2020, retrieved 1,731 grams of lunar samples, consisting primarily of rocks and soil from the lunar surface.
This month, China launched the Chang'e-6 spacecraft to collect and return samples from the moon's far side to understand the formation and evolution of the moon.

China Focus: China's FAST telescope discovers distant gas-rich galaxies,2024-05-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0510/c90000-20168149.html,"Home>>
		
China Focus: China's FAST telescope discovers distant gas-rich galaxies
 (Xinhua) 20:18, May 10, 2024
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have discovered an abundance of gas-rich galaxies in the distant universe, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
The research result has been published online in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Friday.
According to the study, the newly discovered galaxies, whose radio wave emissions have taken almost the age of the solar system to reach the earth, contain similar or more atomic hydrogen gas than the tens of thousands of galaxies previously surveyed with other radio telescopes.
Xi Hongwei from the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), the lead author, together with his colleagues from Australia, the United States and Russia, revealed the properties of six new high-redshift galaxies in the study.
The new high-redshift galaxy sample provides the opportunity to better investigate the evolution of cool gas in galaxies, said the paper. ""A larger sample size in the future will allow us to refine our knowledge of the formation and evolution of galaxies.""
Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. In its neutral form, it is abundant in spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way. Neutral hydrogen is the primary component of the cool interstellar medium (ISM) and is the reservoir of fuel for star formation. However, owing to the sensitivity of existing radio telescopes, the understanding of the evolution of the ISM in galaxies remains limited.
""We have carried out a blind neutral hydrogen search, or the FAST Ultra-Deep Survey. These discoveries are part of the ongoing survey, showing the tremendous sensitivity of the world's largest radio telescope,"" said Peng Bo, a scientist at the NAOC.
""The new FAST survey has so far discovered over 100 new galaxies at distances of up to 5 billion light years, with the final number expected to reach over 1,000,"" Peng added.
The researchers concluded that galaxies 4 billion years ago had much more star-forming gas than current-day galaxies, and that distant galaxies have much greater gas reservoirs than previously believed.
Meanwhile, because the newly discovered galaxies are very faint at such large distances and have different wavelengths, FAST was not able to locate the optical counterparts with the same accuracy as optical telescopes. With the help of experts using the largest optical telescopes in the United States and Russia, the counterpart galaxies were eventually identified.
It was found that these counterparts contain 2-3 times as many stars as the Milky Way, but contain 10 times the mass of hydrogen gas, Peng said.
""This successful collaborative program between Chinese and Australian radio astronomers demonstrates the tremendous potential of the new generation of radio telescopes,"" said Lister Staveley-Smith, a professor from the University of Western Australia.
FAST is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, with a reception area equal to 30 standard football fields. Located in a deep and round karst depression in Guizhou Province, FAST started formal operation in January 2020 and officially opened to the world on March 31, 2021.

China's sci-tech innovations to revolutionize Pakistan's agricultural sector -- experts
 (Xinhua) 20:14, May 10, 2024
ISLAMABAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani experts said on Thursday that the use of China's scientific and technological advancements and innovations would play a key role in revolutionizing Pakistan's agricultural sector, enhancing productivity and food security.
China has not only modernized its agricultural sector, but also helped other countries including Pakistan by sharing advanced farming technologies, promoting agricultural research as well as facilitating knowledge exchange, said the experts during a seminar on sustainable agriculture organized by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), an Islamabad-based think tank.
Speaking on the occasion, Hassan Daud Butt, senior advisor at the China Study Center of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, said that China has made massive progress in the field of agriculture through consistent policies, leadership and technology-driven interventions.
The Chinese advancement in the agriculture sector was unique in its fashion as less public capital and more private sector investment was utilized in developing the agriculture sector, he said, adding that Pakistan has a lot to learn from China to modernize its agriculture sector under the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Launched in 2013, the CPEC, a flagship project of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, is a corridor linking the Gwadar Port in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province with Kashgar in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which highlights energy, transport, and industrial cooperation in the first phase, while in the new phase expands to fields of agriculture and livelihood, among others.
""Pakistan needs to learn from China about planning on short, mid and long-term goals with a top to bottom approach with policy consistency ... Moreover, the leadership in the public and private sector needs to be strengthened through mutual collaborations,"" Butt said.
Gulshan Irshad, an associate professor at the Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi, stressed to focus on transfer of technology, capacity building and knowledge sharing between Pakistan and China on all modern agricultural farming trends.
""Under the CPEC, Pakistan and China need to further collaborate on advanced line seed variety and cropping techniques like aquaponics, hydroponics and tunnel farming,"" she said.
She added that Pakistani farmers are welcoming to modern concepts of agriculture farming, helping them improve their crop yield and reduce the burden on soil and ecology due to environment damaging practices.
Highlighting that the CPEC has played a crucial role in the modernization of the country's agricultural sector over the past decade, Misbah Khan, a senior research associate at the SDPI, stressed the need to take the cooperation between the two countries to new heights.
""Pakistan can create its route towards resilience, productivity and environmental stewardship by developing synergy with China's technology advancement, policy support and investment opportunities,"" Khan said.

Eco-friendly crab farm in E China sets example of efficient, high-quality aquaculture
By Wang Weijian (People's Daily) 15:38, May 10, 2024
A demonstration eco-friendly crab farm by the Taihu Lake in Wujiang district, Suzhou, east China's Jiangsu province has completed a perfect transition - abandoning traditional practices using net enclosure, which featured high pollution and low economic return, and embracing high-quality and high-efficiency ecological aquaculture.
From a distance, the crab farm, which is located in Pujiangyuan, Qidu township of Wujiang district, appears like a picturesque rural park, but up close, it reveals itself as a hive of agricultural activity.

Photo shows the eco-friendly crab farm by the Taihu Lake in Pujiangyuan, Wujiang district, Suzhou, east China's Jiangsu province. (Photo from the public account of Qidu township, Wujiang district on WeChat)
In the ponds, crab farmers are always seen clearing out aquatic weeds, while on the banks, technicians use mobile phones to pilot drones that disperse feed pellets over the water.
This eco-friendly crab farm was established, after net enclosure aquaculture facilities were banned in the Taihu Lake in 2019.
Zhang Jianliang, 53, has been engaged in crab farming for over 20 years. When he was younger, he once used net enclosure facilities on the Taihu Lake.
A few years ago, he contracted 100 mu (6.67 hectares) of crab ponds in the eco-friendly crab farm. ""It's completely different from the past. It's tech-ish,"" he told People's Daily.
""This is an Internet-of-Things (IoT) automatic control system for aquaculture,"" said Zhang, pointing to a silver-white metal box on the shore.
He said the biggest concern in crab farming is low dissolved oxygen levels in the water, which could only be judged based on farmers' experience in the past.
He opened the metal box, and real-time parameters were all displayed on an electronic screen, including dissolved oxygen, pH, and water temperature.
For instance, the dissolved oxygen level, after being obtained by underwater sensors, will be automatically analyzed by the system. If it falls below a preset ""red line,"" the system will automatically activate an oxygenation device to avoid oxygen depletion in the water.
The crab farm is all about technology. On the water surface, unmanned feeding boats cruise automatically. Under the water, IoT flow generators work to simulate a real lake environment to help crabs grow better.
According to Cao Jianzhong, an executive of the crab farm, the farm has invited experts from agricultural universities and enterprises to launch on-site training.
""With the use of technology, oxygenation and feeding have become more targeted. It saves labor, giving us more confidence,"" said Zhang.
In the past, net enclosure aquaculture in the Taihu Lake was completely at the mercy of the weather, and sometimes the farmers would shoulder losses, according to Zhang.
Today, in the eco-friendly crab farm, standardized farming keeps risks under control. It's easy for a farmer to earn 200,000 yuan ($27,678) to 300,000 yuan a year.

Photo shows a smart management platform of the eco-friendly crab farm by the Taihu Lake in Pujiangyuan, Wujiang district, Suzhou, east China's Jiangsu province. (Photo from the public account of Qidu township, Wujiang district on WeChat)
The crab farm covers a total planned area of 27,255 mu, with a 4,225 mu core area, generating an annual output value of around 400 million yuan.
For an aquaculture park of this scale, located along the shoreline of the environmentally sensitive Taihu Lake, how is environmental safety ensured?
On the eastern side of the farm, there are several water pools, which are covered by reeds and occasionally disturbed by waterfowl taking wing.
""Fine sand, zeolite, and limestone are paved at the bottom of these pools,"" said Xi Bin, a management staff member of the farm, adding that it is an ecological treatment system consisting of ecological trenches, ecological ponds, vertical-flow wetlands, and surface-flow wetlands.
Designed by the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the system employs a compound artificial wetland tail water treatment technique to absorb and purify the aquaculture effluent.
""The treated water flows through an intricate network of pipes back into the individual crab ponds. None of it is discharged into the Taihu Lake,"" said Xi.
At 2 pm, technician Xu Junyu of the crab farm received a request for drone support from aquaculture farmer Zhou Shengliang via a smart platform. Xu soon made his way to Zhou's crab pond.
Deftly assembling the drone, Xu loaded a bag of feed pellets into the drone's hopper. With everything prepared, Xu issued commands from his phone, and the drone, equipped with both BeiDou and GPS navigation systems, took to the air over the crab pond.
""I've pre-programmed the speed, heading, and feeding density into the digital system for timed, quantified, and targeted feeding,"" said Xu. For a 30 mu crab pond, manual feeding would take at least half a day, but the drone could complete the task in just minutes.
To provide comprehensive services for aquaculture farmers, the crab farm has employed IoT, cloud computing, big data and other technologies to give aquaculture production a ""smart brain.""
The ""smart brain"", or the smart management platform, is located at an inspection and quarantine center on the eastern side of the crab farm. It has a huge electronic screen and integrates functions such as an overview of the entire farm, intelligent aquaculture management, quality control, and daily operations management. It is learned that crab ponds in the farm are installed with various sensors providing data to support scientific and targeted aquaculture.
The eco-friendly crab farm provides comprehensive supporting services. In a logistics and distribution center, there are various types of automated equipment. Crabs are fed into an automatic binding machine and bound in around 5 seconds; a conveyor line automatically sorts the crabs by weight.
Through an internet-enabled production and marketing model, the crab farm has guided and enabled aquaculture farmers and rural entrepreneurs to increase their incomes.

China's tunnel boring machine industry achieves leapfrog development
By Li Xinping (People's Daily) 14:39, May 10, 2024
A tunnel boring machine (TBM), also referred to as full-section tunnel boring machine, is a machine used to excavate tunnels. It combines multiple technologies such as machinery, electronics, information technology, and artificial intelligence, being acclaimed as the ""king of construction machinery.""
More than two decades ago, China did not have its own TBM. Today, Chinese-produced TBMs account for nearly 70 percent of the global market.

How did the Chinese TBMs make this giant leap? People's Daily reporters delved into the TBM manufacturing companies to uncover the secrets.
In early 2000, when China Railway Group Limited (hereafter referred to as China Railway) decided to develop its own TBM, some thought it was an unrealistic idea.
Wang Dujuan, chief engineer of China Railway Hi-Tech Industry Corporation Limited (CRHIC), a subsidiary of China Railway, said that a TBM has over 20,000 components, and its control system alone has more than 2,000 control points. ""Many colleagues at that time had never even seen a TBM before,"" she recalled.
Thanks to substantial efforts and investments, China's first domestically developed earth pressure balance TBM with independent intellectual property rights made its debut in 2008, known as the ""China Railway No. 1"" TBM.
On February 6, 2009, the China Railway No. 1 TBM started working for a metro project in north China's Tianjin municipality. Four months later, a tunnel of the Tianjin Metro Line 3 was holed through, with ground settlement carefully controlled within 3 millimeters and passing all expert inspections.
Since then, the Chinese TBM industry has gained momentum, with a number of competitive manufacturers emerging and growing, such as China Railway Engineering Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (CREG), China Railway Construction Heavy Industry Corporation Limited (CRCHI), and CCCC Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co., Ltd. affiliated with China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC).
Today, China boasts the world's largest TBM fleet, with approximately 5,000 units. Over 90 percent of China's metro tunnels were constructed using TBM technology.
A TBM stands several stories high and is as heavy as hundreds of elephants. It consists of tens of thousands of components. To enhance the resilience of the industrial and supply chains, every link of the industry must collaborate effectively.
""China's TBM industry follows a development path where the manufacturing of complete TBMs drives the manufacturing of components,"" said Zhang Zhiguo, general manager of CREG.
Ten years ago, bearings and gearboxes needed to be imported due to weaknesses in the industrial chain, and today, these weaknesses are gradually being resolved, Zhang told People's Daily.
Crafting main bearings proved to be one of the most challenging tasks due to the extreme and harsh operating conditions they face as the ""heart"" of a TBM, including ultra-heavy loads, large eccentric loads, and frequently varying loads. Besides, they need to meet critical standards such as high reliability and long service life. The material selection, design, manufacturing, and testing of them also presented immense difficulties. That's why they are considered the pinnacle of the industrial chain of large-scale, high-end, precision bearings.

To finalize the design for main bearings, the Chinese research and development team experimented with hundreds of materials and processes, conducted thousands of theoretical verifications and design optimizations, and analyzed tens of thousands of inspection and test data sets.
In collaboration with leading specialty steel companies in China, CRCHI conducted in-depth research on material elemental matching and methods for controlling impurities and carbides, ultimately overcoming the bottleneck in the materials used for main bearings.
On October 12, 2023, a TBM main bearing with a diameter of 8.61 meters rolled off the production line at a CRCHI facility in Changsha, central China's Hunan province. It was the world's largest-diameter main bearing for TBM, boasting the heaviest weight and highest bearing capacity.
""It marked that China has become a global leader in the development and manufacturing of ultra-large diameter main bearings. Chinese-produced TBM main bearings now cover the full range from small to ultra-large diameters,"" said Liu Feixiang, chief scientist of CRCHI.
Additionally, Chinese enterprises are consistently moving towards intelligent and automated TBM operations, exploring autonomous excavation and remote control capabilities.
For instance, China's independently developed TBM ""Linghang"" is equipped with a system to monitor the status of key components in real-time, including the wear and temperature of cutting tools and slurry circulation pipes. It also provides damage predictions, effectively improving the construction efficiency.
The ""Linghang"" TBM also provides functions of intelligent excavation, intelligent assembly, advanced geological forecasting, and tail-end seal safety warnings. Therefore, it can automatically adjust parameters and excavate in ordinary geological conditions and can be controlled remotely from the ground surface under special circumstances.
Chinese TBM manufacturers are continuously expanding into overseas markets.
In 2012, China exported its first domestically produced TBM after China Railway won the bid for a metro construction project in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. During the construction, the ""China Railway No. 50"" TBM erected an average of eight rings per day, achieving over ten rings per day for seven consecutive days, setting a new record for metro TBM tunneling in Malaysia.
In 2015, China's ""Zhang Heng"" and ""Zhan Tianyou"" TBMs won contracts for metro projects in Singapore. In 2016, a rectangular pipe jack TBM was awarded another contract, pioneering the entry of China's specialized TBMs into overseas markets.
In 2019, the ""China Railway No. 699"" TBM won a bid for a railway project in northern Italy, marking the first application of China's advanced tunneling equipment in a country of European Union. In the same year, two domestically produced TBMs were contracted for a Paris metro construction project in France.
""All these demonstrate the recognition for the comprehensive strength of China's TBM brands by the international high-end market,"" said Zhang.

Sea surface temperature anomalies used to predict global dengue trends: study,2024-05-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0510/c90000-20167936.html,"Home>>
		
Sea surface temperature anomalies used to predict global dengue trends: study
 (Xinhua) 14:10, May 10, 2024
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that the sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean can predict the magnitude of global dengue epidemics.
The study published in the journal Science suggested that the climate indicator could enhance the forecasting and planning for outbreak responses.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne flavivirus disease that affects nearly half the world's population. Climate events like El Nino are known to influence the dynamics of dengue transmission globally by affecting mosquito breeding.
Using climate-driven mechanistic models and data on dengue cases reported from 46 countries in Southeast Asia and America, the researchers from Beijing Normal University identified associations between global climate patterns and the seasonal and interannual magnitude of dengue epidemics in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
The study revealed that the model has the ability to make dengue warnings with a significant lead time of up to nine months, which is a substantial improvement over the previous models that could only provide warnings three months in advance.
The findings could allow for more effective planning for outbreak response, but further assessments are needed to evaluate the predictive performance of the model, said Tian Huaiyu from the university, the corresponding author of the paper.

Sci-tech innovation boosts value of Ningxia's goji berries
 (Xinhua) 13:09, May 10, 2024
YINCHUAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- In a scene previously unimaginable, sliding rain shelters, artificial rainfall systems, and state-of-the-art weather stations now dot the landscape of the Xizan ecological goji berry plantation in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
This transformation is emblematic of the region's commitment to modernizing its goji berry industry through innovative technological solutions.
Spearheaded by a collaboration between the Ningxia goji berry meteorological service center and local enterprises, the Xizan plantation serves as a pioneering meteorological experimental base for goji berry. Here, researchers study and address various meteorological challenges encountered during the different developmental stages of goji berry cultivation.
""For example, we forecast spring frost when bud emerges, and assess the impact of summer precipitation on fruit quality during fruiting period,"" said Zhang Lei, an expert at the Ningxia institute of meteorological sciences.
Through meteorological disaster monitoring and early warning, effective production advice and pest control measures are offered, ensuring both the yield and quality of goji berry harvest, Zhang added. ""Farming no longer relies solely on weather conditions.""
Goji berry, also known as wolfberry, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, has garnered renewed attention for its health benefits, particularly its immune-boosting properties attributed to compounds like lutein and lycium barbarum polysaccharides.
Despite being one of China's major goji berry-producing regions, Ningxia encountered stagnation in its gobi berry industry due to limited processing capabilities, with the industry primarily restricted to the sale of dried fruits.
Recent initiatives, however, have sparked a paradigm shift, with a focus on the integration of advanced technologies to propel the industry toward high-quality production. Over 270 scientific projects involving the berry, supported by an investment of nearly 290 million yuan (about 40.84 million U.S. dollars), have been implemented in Ningxia.
At Beryl Gojiberries Co., Ltd., one of the region's leading goji berry producers, ongoing research endeavors aim to unlock the full potential of goji berry derivatives.
""The red pigment found in goji berries has been confirmed to protect the liver from alcohol damage. Presently, we are working to convert it into oral tablets,"" said Li Fan, who works as a researcher at Beryl.
""At every stage of its life cycle, from the fields to the workshops, and ultimately to the taste buds of consumers, each premium goji berry is infused with a focus on technological innovation,"" said Hao Xiangfeng, president of the Ningxia Goji Berry Association and Beryl Gojiberries Co., Ltd.
Beryl has partnered with top universities and research institutions, securing over 40 patents, Hao added. According to him, their breakthrough product, the ""fresh-locked goji berry,"" reduces drying time from 120 to 20 hours, preserving moisture and nutrients, resulting in vibrant color and a softer texture. This innovative snack has gained popularity among young consumers.
""Today, a gram of fresh-locked goji berry can fetch up to 1.2 yuan, dozens of times higher than before,"" Hao said.
As of 2023, Ningxia's goji berry cultivation area totaled 325,000 mu (about 21,667 hectares). Through deep processing, the fruit is turned into various products such as functional beverages, health foods and snacks, driving the total industry output value to 29 billion yuan.
Fueled by increasing consumer demand for health-conscious products, the goji berry market is rapidly expanding, presenting significant industry opportunities. Ningxia's goji berry industry development plan forecasts a total industry chain output value of 100 billion yuan by 2030.
""To reach this goal, developing new quality productive forces is crucial,"" said Hao, adding that the company's future endeavors will focus on establishing smart goji berry plantations, digitized workshops, and a precision marketing strategy using the internet.

Chinese agricultural technologies attract visitors at Africa fertilizer expo
 (Xinhua) 09:46, May 10, 2024
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Benedict Russo, a farmer in his late 40s, was among the hundreds of visitors who attended the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, to explore the latest agricultural technology products on display.
During an interview with Xinhua on Wednesday, Russo expressed his delight at discovering the stand by DJI, a Chinese technology company that manufactures drones, as he sought the latest agricultural solutions to boost his farm yields.
The father of three, who owns a cotton farm in the southeastern Kenyan county of Kitui, said he is interested in acquiring a drone to monitor the health of cash crops on his expansive farm. ""The agricultural drones will enable me to detect early signs of disease without the use of many laborers at the farm,"" Russo explained, hoping that by purchasing the drones, he would reduce his operating costs and boost profits.
Steven Dai, a sales executive at DJI, said that their drones are equipped with the latest technology for efficient aerial surveying of large parcels of land at minimal cost.
DJI drones, with high-resolution cameras, facilitate precise spraying of pesticides for better results compared to manual back-carried sprayers, he added.
The three-day fertilizer summit, themed ""Listen to the Land,"" began Tuesday and drew over 2,000 attendees, including foreign donors, scientists and agriculture officials. Convened by the African Union (AU), the Kenyan government and multilateral partners, the summit is expected to adopt a new roadmap for revitalizing soil health in Africa.

Researchers classify atmospheric escape mechanism of low-mass exoplanets,2024-05-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0510/c90000-20167642.html,"Home>>
		
Researchers classify atmospheric escape mechanism of low-mass exoplanets
 (Xinhua) 08:40, May 10, 2024
KUNMING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese researchers has offered a perspective on the atmospheric escape processes of low-mass exoplanets, specifically a process known as hydrodynamic escape, according to a research article published in the journal Nature Astronomy on Thursday.
This research revealed various driving mechanisms affecting the hydrodynamic escapes and proposed a new classification method to understand the escape processes.
Exoplanets refer to planets outside the solar system and are a popular subject in astronomical research. The atmospheres of these planets can leave the planet and enter space for various reasons. One such reason is hydrodynamic escape, which is the process of the upper atmosphere leaving the planet as a whole.
According to the researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Yunnan Observatories, this process is much more intense than the particle behavior escape observed in the solar system's planets. They added that hydrodynamic atmospheric escape might have happened in the early stages of the solar system's planets.
""If Earth had lost its entire atmosphere via hydrodynamic escape at that time, it might have become as desolate as Mars,"" explained Guo Jianheng, a researcher with the Yunnan Observatories.
Even though this intense escape no longer occurs on planets like Earth, space and ground telescopes have observed that hydrodynamic escape still occurs on some exoplanets that are very close to their host stars. This process not only changes the planet's mass but also affects its climate and habitability.
Before this study, people relied on complex models to determine which physical mechanism was driving the hydrodynamic escape on a planet, and the conclusions were often obscure.
The researchers found that the hydrodynamic atmospheric escape of low-mass exoplanets could be driven either solely or jointly by the planet's internal energy, the work done by the star's tidal forces, or heating by the star's extreme ultraviolet radiation.
They proposed that just using the basic physical parameters of the star and planet, such as mass, radius, and orbital distance, can classify the mechanisms of hydrodynamic escape from low-mass planets.
On planets with low mass and large radius, sufficient internal energy or high temperature can drive atmospheric escape. The study found that the planet's internal and potential energy ratio can determine whether the aforementioned escape occurs.
For planets whose internal energy cannot drive atmospheric escape, researchers can accurately distinguish the roles of stellar tidal forces and extreme ultraviolet radiation by introducing tidal forces from stars to correct the ratio of internal energy to potential energy.
The results of this study are helpful in understanding how a planet's atmosphere evolves over time but also have potential applications in exploring the evolution and origins of low-mass planets.
