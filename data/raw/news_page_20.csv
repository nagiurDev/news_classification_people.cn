China's AI model advances effective forecast time of global mid-term weather to 11.25 days
By Zhao Yusha (Global Times) 09:45, July 19, 2024
A Chinese artificial intelligence lab has successfully advanced the effective forecast time of global mid-term weather to 11.25 days for the first time. It managed to achieve weather forecasting ranging from severe convective weather that occurs within minutes to 10-year ocean climate prediction.
The weather forecast model is called Fengwu, a machine-learning model developed by the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
Unlike the traditional physical models that mostly run on supercomputers, Fengwu uses artificial intelligence to analyze the elements provided by atmospheric data assimilation, such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity to predict future weather. Artificial intelligence can utilize past meteorological elements, such as temperature, to make more precise forecasts, explained Ouyang Wanli, a scientist from the Shanghai lab, to the Global Times.
Currently, Fengwu has achieved a breakthrough in global medium-term meteorological forecasting, advancing the effective forecast time to 11.25 days for the first time. Moreover, the model has been upgraded and expanded to include modules for severe convective weather forecasting, global medium-term meteorological forecasting, and ocean climate forecasting, the Global Times learned from the Shanghai lab.
It can now provide forecasts ranging from minute-level severe convective weather to decade-long ocean climate predictions, covering precipitation, temperature, wind, solar radiation, ocean currents, sea temperature, and other climate and meteorological elements.
The forecast of 11.25 days has made Fengwu surpass some of the international equivalents in predicting weather.
In November 2023, Google DeepMind released an AI that delivers 10-day weather forecasts with unprecedented accuracy and speed.
Moreover, Fengwu has realized weather forecasts from ""doorstep"" to ""the heart of the ocean."" It can provide accurate weather forecasts of severe convection weather within one kilometer, and offer accurate weather and ocean activity forecasts for different altitudes and depths of the sea.
In recent years, the world has suffered from increasingly frequent climate disasters. More common extreme weather-related disasters have highlighted an urgency for weather forecasts to become more precise.
So far, the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory has cooperated with both national and Shanghai's municipal meteorological bureaus to construct severe convective weather forecast models, allowing for precise radar precipitation forecasts every five minutes for the next two hours.
Due to its own limitations and the uncertainty of weather, the traditional model of weather forecast still cannot meet the diverse and growing needs of today's users; whilst data-driven AI methods provide very useful tools to bridge this gap, Dai Kan, deputy head of China's National Meteorological Center, told the Global Times in a previous interview.
In addition to Fengwu, the Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science (SAIS) and Fudan University unveiled the upgraded model, known as FuXi 2.0, last month. It is the first global large weather model for weather routing, Xinhua News Agency quoted a press release of the university as saying.
Fuxi 2.0 has made progress in terms of mid-term weather forecasting models and sub-seasonal models, targeting industries such as new energy, aviation, and maritime transportation.
The Chinese government has already started exploring various ways of using artificial intelligence in weather forecasting.
In May this year, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) launched a pilot program for AI weather forecasts.
AI models participating in the program will use real-time observational data provided by the CMA as input fields to produce weather forecasts for the coming 15 days. The demonstration products include forecasts for high-altitude meteorological elements, surface meteorological elements, typhoon paths, and forecasts for hazardous weather processes.

Chinese scientists discover new high-temperature superconductor
 (Xinhua) 21:12, July 18, 2024
SHANGHAI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have discovered a new high-temperature superconductor with a superconducting volume fraction of 86 percent.
The team, led by professor Zhao Jun at Fudan University's Department of Physics, has published its findings in the international academic journal Nature.
Superconductors are materials that exhibit zero electrical resistance and complete diamagnetism under specific temperature conditions. They have broad applications in areas such as power transmission and storage, medical imaging, magnetic levitation trains, and quantum computing.
The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the 1980s shattered the previous belief that superconductivity could only exist at extremely low temperatures.
Zhao said that an important task for research in the area is the discovery of new high-temperature superconductors, which can provide insight into the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity and open new application prospects.
Zhao's team successfully synthesized high-quality, trilayer nickelate single crystal samples with a superconducting volume fraction close to that of cuprate high-temperature superconductors, providing strong proof of the bulk superconducting properties of nickelates.
Zhao noted that the conditions required to synthesize nickelate single crystal samples are extremely stringent, requiring a specific high oxygen pressure environment with a high temperature and sharp temperature gradient.
Through repeated efforts, the team succeeded in synthesizing high-purity, trilayer nickelate single crystal samples by using a high-pressure optical floating zone technique.

China's AG600 amphibious aircraft completes high temperature, high humidity flight test
 (Xinhua) 13:08, July 18, 2024
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's independently-developed AG600 large amphibious aircraft has successfully completed the high temperature and high humidity flight test, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) on Thursday.
The AG600 carried out this test, which lasted around 2.5 hours, on Tuesday at an airport in Nanchang, east China's Jiangxi Province. All of its systems performed well during the session, said the AVIC, the country's leading aircraft manufacturer.
Prior to the flight test, the aircraft was exposed to the sun for five hours in an environment with an average temperature of more than 35 degrees Celsius and an average humidity of more than 44 percent.
The high temperature and high humidity flight tests the aircraft's hydraulic system, and is a major part of the AG600's certification process.
According to the AVIC, the AG600 aircraft aims to obtain its type certificate at the end of this year.
Intensive flight tests are undergoing. Four AG600 airplanes, meant for test flight use, are undertaking airworthiness flight test missions across the country to verify this new type of aircraft's performance and compliance with airworthiness standards.
In February this year, the AG600 completed the cold-weather flight test in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
The aircraft then successively carried out the night test flight, and multiple other flight test subjects such as the in-flight airspeed calibration and standard stall speed, said the AVIC.
After the latest high temperature and high humidity flight test in Nanchang, it will fly to a civil aircraft flight test center in Pucheng in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the company added.
There, AG600 aircraft will continuously conduct the following up flight tests and other related test missions.
The AG600 large amphibious aircraft family is being developed as vital advanced aeronautical equipment to strengthen the country's emergency-rescue capabilities, according to the developer.
The AG600 series amphibious aircraft features a unique configuration consisting of an integrated aircraft-shaped upper body and a ship-bottom-shaped lower body.
This aircraft family is tailored to carry out rescue missions such as firefighting, and maritime search and rescue in all types of terrains across the country, said the developer.

Chinese team develops versatile AI model capable of reading cancer images
 (Xinhua) 09:34, July 18, 2024
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese team has developed the country's first versatile artificial intelligence (AI) model that is adept at analyzing a diverse range of pathological images. This advanced model is capable of examining more than 20 human organs, including the lungs, breast and liver.
This large language model (LLM) known as PathOrchestra represents a breakthrough in AI-assisted disease diagnosis, heralding a transformative shift from a singular model dedicated to a specific cancer to a versatile one capable of addressing a multitude of them.
The researchers from Air Force Medical University (AFMU), Tsinghua University and SenseTime leveraged China's largest domestic dataset comprising nearly 300,000 whole-slide digital pathology images, which equates to an impressive 300 terabytes of data.
Harnessing self-supervised learning, the model ""cross-learned"" to analyze over 20 different organs and has accomplished a slew of clinical tasks, including pan-cancer classification, lesion identification and detection, multi-cancer subtype differentiation and biomarker assessment.
The diversity in pathological images poses a formidable challenge for AI applications, and this complexity has earned it the title of the ""jewel in the crown"" in the realm of image processing, said Wang Zhe, a professor from the Basic Medical Science Academy under the AFMU.
PathOrchestra has achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 95 percent in nearly 50 clinical tasks, including lymphoma subtype diagnosis and bladder cancer screening, according to an AFMU news release on Tuesday.
This advancement can substantially reduce the workload of pathologists, and notably increased the efficiency of reviewing medical images, said the researchers.
PathOrchestra stands as an example among the burgeoning landscape of large models in China, representing the country's rapid and vibrant growth in the field of AI.
Of the more than 1,300 AI LLMs globally, 36 percent are from China, the second-largest proportion after the United States, according to a white paper on the global digital economy released recently by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology at the Global Digital Economy Conference 2024.

JINAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have decoded a novel salt-tolerance gene in wheat, resulting in yield increases of 5 percent to 9 percent in experimental varieties grown in saline-alkali soils.
The study findings have been published in the journal Nature Genetics.
Wang Meng, corresponding author of the study, from the Institute of Soil Science (ISS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that China's primary wheat-growing regions coincide with high occurrences of soil salinization. Spring marks a crucial growth period for wheat, characterized by jointing and grain filling, yet it aligns with peak soil salinity, severely impacting wheat growth and yield.
Researchers from the ISS, Northwest A&F University and Qingdao Agricultural University analysed over 500 wheat varieties and lines cultivated for years in saline-alkali fields and identified TaSPL6-D, a transcriptional suppressor of critical salt-tolerance genes in wheat.
The research team found that due to natural genetic variation, there exists a natural variant of TaSPL6-D, termed TaSPL6-D-In in landraces, which loses its ability to suppress key salt-tolerance genes in wheat.
Using molecular-assisted breeding method, researchers introduced TaSPL6-D-In from a landrace into a leading wheat cultivar, successfully improving the yield in saline-alkali soils.
Zhao Zhendong, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and Cao Xiaofeng, an academician with CAS, both said that this research provides pivotal design targets for advancing molecular breeding in salt-tolerant wheat and other crops.

Bionic dolphin skin saves fuel for large crude carrier,2024-07-17,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0717/c90000-20194463.html,"Home>>
		
Bionic dolphin skin saves fuel for large crude carrier
 (Xinhua) 09:03, July 17, 2024
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Docked at the Quanzhou port in east China's Fujian Province, after completing three oil delivery trips, is a very large crude carrier (VLCC) with a deadweight tonnage of 300,000 tonnes, equipped with a bionic skin propeller.
The bionic skin on the propeller saved about 2 percent of the crude carrier's fuel consumption, according to media reports. It was also estimated that 1.5 percent of energy would be saved on average within a 2.5-year maintenance cycle.
According to such energy consumption, a VLCC is estimated to save more than 300 tonnes of fuel each year, achieving direct economic benefits of over 1 million yuan (about 140,000 U.S. dollars) and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 900 tonnes.
Sea transportation is crucial to the global economic activity, but it also consumes a large amount of energy and has become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, it is urgent to make breakthroughs in the key energy conservation and emission reduction technologies for large carriers as well as to push the green transformation of global marine transport industry.
Large crude carriers were primarily powered by the thrust generated by propellers, which overcomes the resistance between the ship's body and water to propel the ship forward.
Researchers from the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering under the Chinese Academy of Sciences collaborated with the COSCO SHIPPING Energy Transportation Co., Ltd. to carry out a research project on marine bionic skin development in order to save energy in marine transportation.
This study was inspired by the marine creatures such as dolphins and sharks, which encounter very little resistance when swimming in the sea, mainly due to their surface's micro-structure, flexibility and mucus secretion.
The dolphin skin forms a micro-structure in the water flow, generating micro-eddy currents that convert the sliding friction between the skin and the water flow into rolling friction. When combined with the lubrication of the epidermal mucus, the turbulent kinetic energy of the water flow is effectively minimized.
The bionic dolphin skin, similar to the dolphin skin, was developed by the artificial synthesis method. It was composed of liquid-like dynamic interfacial materials and flexible materials between 0.1 and 0.2 mm microstructure, said Zeng Zhixiang, a researcher at the institute.
""Different from bionic shark skin, the bionic dolphin skin has a comparatively simpler structure and is more cost-effective,"" said Zeng.
He estimated the cost of placing the bionic dolphin skin over a propeller would cost about 20,000 U.S. dollars.
The bionic skin, when placed on the propeller's surface, can reduce shear force with the water, counteract the work of the reverse thrust on the water, improve the propeller efficiency, and reduce energy consumption.
The bionic flexible drag reducing material used in the crude carrier complies with the International Convention for the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships.
Meanwhile, for approximately 200 days, the bionic dolphin skin-equipped VLCC sailed over 35,000 nautical miles between Chinese coastal ports and major Middle Eastern ports.
COSCO SHIPPING Energy Transportation and Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering intend to promote the application of such bionic skins in more than 100 crude carriers to provide significant economic benefits while also effectively reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

After the recent implementation of driverless ride-hailing vehicles sparked heated discussion, a total of 20 self-driving buses will be put into operation in Shenzhen in South China's Guangdong Province within the year, according to local media reports. Experts told the Global Times on Tuesday that the future of autonomous driving applications still faces many challenges including safety concerns.
Four self-driving bus routes have been currently approved and are expected to officially launch by the end of July, with a fare of 1 yuan ($0.14) for each ride. The routes will cover subway stations, commercial and residential areas, central business districts, industrial parks, and scenic spots.
According to the reports, the driverless buses are equipped with high-definition on-board cameras, millimeter-wave radar, and LiDAR for 360-degree accurate perception of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and changes in road conditions.
The vehicles are also equipped with the country's leading automated driving system, enabling quick judgment and decision-making comparable to an experienced driver. This system allows for precise control of the vehicle, ensuring safe navigation along predetermined routes.
The buses feature an intelligent interactive display screen inside, which provides real-time information on the surrounding traffic participants perceived by the vehicle's sensors, the vehicle's autonomous driving status, and the planned driving route, local media reported.
During the operation, the vehicles can accurately recognize lane markings and traffic lights, perform overtaking maneuvers, and efficiently handle various challenging urban driving scenarios. For instance, it can safely execute unprotected left turns at intersections without traffic lights, navigates intersections with mixed pedestrian and vehicle traffic, identify and yield to vehicles encroaching on the lane and construction areas, give way to pedestrians, and precisely stop at stations.
In Ji'nan, the capital of East China's Shandong Province, the first batch of driverless buses have also started trial operation to collect map data, according to local media reports on Sunday.
Ji'nan has introduced a total of four driverless buses, with the first driverless bus to undertake 240 hours or 1,000 kilometers of on-road testing and other preliminary work after completing the map collection. When the requirements are met, it will enter the demonstration application phase.
On July 3, government departments jointly released a list of pilot areas for the application of the intelligent network integrating intelligent vehicles, smart roads, and real-time cloud technologies, with 20 cities selected, including Jinan and Shenzhen.
Shanghai is also set to begin public testing of autonomous cars as early as next week, offering free rides for residents throughout the trial period.
According to an earlier report, concerns about the safety of autonomous driving have been raised following one of Baidu's autonomous ride-hailing platform Robotaxi's vehicles colliding with a pedestrian on a street in Wuhan. Central China's Hubei Province.
Wu Shuocheng, a veteran automobile industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the trend toward automated driving continues to be acceptable, but there may be challenges ahead for large-scale development. It may be used more frequently in some closed and relatively simple route scenarios.
Self-driving technology is undoubtedly becoming more mature, with its iterations happening relatively fast, but the public still has concerns about the level of maturity of this technology, Wu said.
Wu also noted that people have concerns regarding the lack of clarity in assigning responsibility. If no one is sitting behind the wheel, the question of whether the accident was solely due to a communication network problem, a software problem, or an underlying problem with road infrastructure remains unclear.
From a technical perspective, in the absence of vulnerabilities, autonomous driving technology is certainly safer than human driving. However, its greatest risk lies in software control. If the program is maliciously altered, accidents could become more severe, Wu said.
According to the local government in Pingshan district of Shenzhen, the application of the intelligent network integrating intelligent vehicles, smart roads, and real-time cloud technologies, is opening up a new track as many enterprises in the industry chain are pursuing the opportunity, and Shenzhen has nearly 460 intelligent networked automobile-related enterprises, generally forming a comprehensive ecosystem.
However, Wu noted that there is a high cost associated with purchasing and operating autonomous driving applications, with few companies or individuals willing to pay for it, which is also one of the challenges the industry has to face.

China's first launch complex dedicated to servicing commercial space operations is scheduled to carry out its debut mission in the coming autumn, according to its top manager.
Yang Tianliang, chairman of the Hainan International Commercial Aerospace Launch Center in Wenchang, Hainan province, told China Daily in an exclusive interview on Tuesday that if everything goes according to plan, the center's debut launch will take place around September or October.
""This is because we need time to carry out all-system rehearsals to prepare our staff for the first launch and spot possible problems. So far, most of the rehearsal tasks have been accomplished. We will make some small changes to related procedures based on the results of the rehearsals,"" he said.
Construction of the second of the first two launch towers was completed in early June. Construction of the first tower was finished in late December.
In the coming weeks, workers at the complex will conduct rehearsals with a real carrier rocket, which will be used for the debut flight, after it is transported to the center, according to Yang.
He did not reveal the type of the rocket to be used in the coming mission, but sources from the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp and one of the country's two major rocket makers, have said that the rocket will be a Long March 12, and the mission will also mark the model's first flight.
According to designers, the Long March 12 is the latest model in the Long March family and the first Chinese rocket with a diameter of 3.8 meters — wider than the 3.35-meter diameter of most Chinese rockets. It has two stages, with a combined height of more than 60 meters.
Propelled by six engines fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene, the rocket will be capable of transporting spacecraft with a combined weight of at least 10 metric tons to a low-Earth orbit, or six tons of satellites to a typical sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 700 kilometers.
Yang said that whether other launch missions will be carried out before the end of this year will depend on restoration work after the first launch. ""In 2025, we plan to conduct the first launch of any privately built rocket at our center. We will also strive to make our facilities ready for more missions that will come next year,"" he said.
Yang's center is a joint venture of the Hainan provincial government and three State-owned space conglomerates — China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, China Aerospace Science and IndustryCorp, and China Satellite Network Group.
Construction, which began in July 2022, was undertaken by China Aerospace Construction Group.
The No. 1 launch tower is specifically tasked with servicing Long March 8 carrier rockets. The No. 2 tower is capable of servicing more than 10 types of liquid-propellant carrier rockets, including those in the Long March family and models developed by private companies.
When put into operation, the complex will become the fifth ground-based launch complex in China and the first dedicated to facilitating commercial space missions.
The other launch complex in Hainan, the Wenchang Space Launch Center, is administered by the central government and primarily tasked with serving State programs. There are three more such centers in China, located in Jiuquan in Gansu province, Taiyuan in Shanxi province, and Xichang in Sichuan province.

"Chinese, U.S. scientists identify gene flow of modern humans with Neanderthals",2024-07-16,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0716/c90000-20194305.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese, U.S. scientists identify gene flow of modern humans with Neanderthals
 (Xinhua) 16:16, July 16, 2024
NANJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A collaborative team of scientists from China and the United States has found ample evidence for gene flow between modern human and its prehistoric cousin Neanderthals.
Neanderthals are an extinct species of archaic humans who lived as hunter-gatherers in Europe and Western Asia around 400,000 years ago before disappearing around 30,000 years ago.
When modern human populations traveled from Africa to the Middle East, they are thought to have shared both the timeline and the landscape with the Neanderthals, marking a period of coexistence and possible genetic mixing.
Researchers from Southeast University in Nanjing and Princeton University developed a method for estimating the presence of human-introgressed sequences within the Neanderthal genome, which they then applied to whole-genome sequence data from a diverse sample of 2,000 contemporary humans and three Neanderthals.
The result has shown that the Neanderthal genomes contain between 2.5 and 3.7 percent of genetic sequences originating from modern humans, according to the study published in the latest edition of the weekly journal Science.
The genetic data also revealed that the Neanderthal population was significantly smaller, approximately 20 percent less than previous estimates had suggested, implying that harmful mutations were more likely to accumulate in the Neanderthal gene pool.
The team also suggested the possibility of two distinct waves of gene flow from humans to Neanderthals, occurring approximately 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, respectively.
The smaller estimated population size and inferred admixture dynamics are consistent with a scenario in which Neanderthal population decreased in size over time and ultimately being absorbed into the modern human's gene pool, said the researchers.

Satellite internet takes off in China, offering new horizons for connectivity
 (Xinhua) 16:14, July 16, 2024
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- In the remote and rugged Yulong Naxi Autonomous County, southwest China's Yunnan Province, the deployment of ground base stations was once a difficult task. Local power grid staff often struggled with unstable signals, sluggish internet speeds and poor connectivity. But those issues are things of the past.
Power inspectors can now easily transmit real-time videos, instructions and other data to a monitoring center located 500 km away, a technological advancement that comes from satellite internet.
Not only in the deep mountains but also out at sea and up in the air, people can now savor the joy of web surfing on satellite internet. The industry has been booming in China, frequently capturing national headlines with its progress, from establishing the first high-orbit satellite internet to launching the first medium-Earth-orbit communication satellite. In May, the space-based technology service was introduced and tested in Thailand, showcasing its global potential.
Satellite internet is a type of internet connection that involves satellites in space playing the role of the base station on the ground. Each satellite can serve as a mobile base station, providing users worldwide with convenient internet access services.
The initial use of satellite communication was primarily for transoceanic TV broadcasting and long-distance telephone calls. However, we have now entered the era of satellite internet, where personal broadband access takes center stage, according to He Shanbao, a researcher at Beijing Information Science and Technology University.
The current coverage of mobile internet only reaches a small portion of the Earth's surface. Access to the internet in deserts, oceans and jungles has to rely on satellite connections. Moreover, during natural disasters when ground base stations are damaged, satellite communications become particularly crucial, said Yin Haoqiong, a senior researcher from China Satellite Communications Co., Ltd.
Satellite internet has been constantly expanding its application scenarios. Yin's company, together with airline companies, has launched a service that allows passengers to connect to in-flight wi-fi using their mobile phones or other devices and enjoy streaming videos, browsing the web and watching sports events in real time at speeds comparable to 4G.
Geespace, a technology enterprise under the Chinese automaker Geely, has initiated the development of vehicle satellite internet services. With the help of the technology, users can make satellite calls, and send and receive messages, through the vehicle system when there is no ground network. Additionally, in the case of a vehicle collision, the vehicle can utilize satellite communication links for emergency alarms, as well as reporting its status.
In February this year, telecom giant China Mobile released a white paper highlighting the gradual integration of satellite internet across various industries. On the one hand, the industry will drive technological advancements in emergency rescue, oceanic navigation and aviation airborne operations. On the other hand, it will create new application scenarios, including unmanned maritime and industrial operations.
To bring satellite internet into the mass consumer market, the direct connection between mobile phones and satellites is essential. In 2023, China Telecom pioneered launching a direct satellite service for mobile phones. Domestic smartphone brands like Huawei, Honor and OPPO also released new phone models with satellite calling features.
China's satellite internet has also expanded its reach to the overseas market. In June, the Chinese private company GalaxySpace and Thailand's Mahanakorn University of Technology organized a seminar in Bangkok, where they showcased a real-time demonstration of satellite internet applications. At the event, elderly individuals at a care center located 160 km away engaged in a live video call via satellite internet with participants at the seminar. This display highlighted the strong support capabilities of satellite internet in telemedicine scenarios.
The Chinese government has been a staunch supporter of the satellite internet industry since 2020, integrating it into the national development infrastructure. Regions like Beijing and Shanghai have rolled out policies to nurture this burgeoning sector.
In 2019, Elon Musk and SpaceX spearheaded the creation of high-speed satellite internet services. Numerous Chinese private enterprises, including satellite and rocket manufacturers, have actively invested in the industry since then. The market size of China's satellite internet is projected to reach 44.7 billion yuan (about 6.3 billion U.S. dollars) by 2025, according to estimates from industry insiders.
Liu Tun, a senior analyst at an institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that the involvement of the private sector ""will not only boost economic growth but also contribute to enhancing the country's capabilities for independent innovation in the industry.""

New plant species found in south China
 (Xinhua) 15:37, July 16, 2024
NANNING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have discovered a new fern species in south China, and named it Cyrtomium adenotrichum.
The researchers found around 10 wild Cyrtomium adenotrichum on a cliff in Nandan County under Hechi City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to the Guangxi Institute of Chinese Medicine and Pharmaceutical Science.
The findings, recently published in PhytoKeys, an international journal of plant taxonomy, revealed that the new species belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and the genus Cyrtomium, with a plant height ranging from 5 to 15 cm.
The species features a sparsely glandular leaf axis, a unique structure that easily distinguishes it from other species in the genus Cyrtomium.
Due to its rarity, small population and fragile habitat, the researchers classified the species as critically endangered based on the criteria set by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.
Research on the biological, ecological and medicinal value of the species will be further conducted, according to the researchers.

Carrying an oxygen tank and wearing a diving suit, Zhang Peidong, a professor at the Fisheries College of Ocean University of China (OUC), dived into a sea area of Swan Lake in Rongcheng, a county-level city of Weihai in east China's Shandong Province, to check on the growth of seagrass.
Zhang saw an underwater ""grassland"" thriving with sea snails, crabs, shellfish and other marine animals there. The underwater ""grassland"" is the seafloor covered with seagrass, also known as seagrass beds.
Zhang and his teammates have dedicated 16 years to ""planting"" seagrass and protecting the marine environment.
In winter of 2008, Zhang and his teammates came to Swan Lake, a wintering place for whooper swans, for research.
They found that the number of overwintering whooper swans plummeted in the lake due to the significant decrease in eelgrass, a type of seagrass that serves as a major source of food for the birds and plays a vital role in protecting the local marine ecosystem, as a result of human activities.
According to their research, a large number of seagrass beds disappeared nationwide back then. The submarine ecological crisis drove them to lead students to ""plant"" seagrass and explore ways to restore the seagrass bed ecosystem.
""To 'plant' seagrass, we needed to conduct extensive surveys and experiments beforehand to understand the growth rules of seagrass and develop targeted measures,"" Zhang said, adding that this process alone took them 10 years.
In the same year, the Mashan Group, a Weihai-based company committed to marine ecological restoration, provided various support including workshops and office space by Swan Lake for the research team of the OUC. In 2022, the university and the company jointly established a science and technology backyard there.
After a long period of hard work, the research team developed an artificial cultivation technology of eelgrass seedlings after figuring out the growth rules and the best timing to pick seeds. Researchers collect eelgrass seeds underwater, artificially cultivate seedlings and then transplant them in the sea.
They have managed to shorten the germination stage of eelgrass seeds from over 80 days in the natural environment to about just 10 days, according to Li Wentao, a member of the research team.
The research team has developed a relatively complete ecological restoration system for seagrass beds in temperate zones.
In 2022, the technical specification for seagrass bed construction, compiled under the leadership of the OUC's research team, was approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. This is China's first industry standard for seagrass bed ecological restoration technologies, laying a technical foundation for standardizing and guaranteeing seagrass bed ecological restoration projects in the country.
The research team has also developed several sets of equipment with independent intellectual property rights, significantly improving the planting efficiency.
So far, the OUC's research team has participated in more than 10 submarine ecological restoration projects in China, restoring and maintaining over 20,000 mu (1,333 hectares) of seagrass beds in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. Over 40 percent of Swan Lake's seagrass beds have been restored, attracting up to 8,000 whooper swans to the area to spend winter every year.
""In the future, we aim to combine seagrass bed ecological restoration with carbon sequestration, green marine ranches, high-value ecological products, and tourism to achieve both ecological and economic benefits,"" Zhang said.

Chinese researchers unveil key factors of Cambrian Explosion of life
 (Xinhua) 09:02, July 16, 2024
HEFEI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently discovered a link between oceanic oxygenation and early animal evolution, shedding new light on the Cambrian Explosion.
The Cambrian Explosion occurred around the early Cambrian period, approximately 541 million years ago. This period witnessed a rapid increase in the taxonomic diversity, morphological disparity, and ecological complexity of early animals.
Global oceanic oxygenation has been proposed to be the main driver of this rapid evolution. However, recent findings suggest the oxygen requirements needed to satisfy the basic metabolic needs of early animals may have been met.
Some view oceanic oxygenation as a consequence of the Cambrian Explosion rather than a cause, and oceanic oxygenation can interact with animal evolution via positive feedback loops.
Thus, the mechanistic relationship between oceanic oxygenation and early animal evolution remains mysterious.
To gain insights into marine habitability for the Cambrian Explosion, researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China analyzed excess barium contents and isotope compositions of Cambrian metalliferous black shales in the Yangtze Block of South China.
They discovered that global oceanic oxygenation across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition may have increased the sulfate reservoir via oxidation of sulfide and concurrently decreased the barium reservoir by barite precipitation.
High concentrations of barium in water can inhibit the survival rate of aquatic animals. The removal of both sulfate and barium that are deleterious to animals could have improved marine habitability for the Cambrian Explosion of early animals.
The study was published in the journal National Science Review.

SHENZHEN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- In an automotive factory, silver humanoid robots stride along assembly lines, conducting tasks once performed exclusively by humans -- from car scanning to seatbelt inspection and affixing labels onto vehicles.
This is not a scene from a sci-fi movie, but a collaboration between UBTECH, a Shenzhen-based robotics firm, and Chinese electric carmaker NIO, highlighting the rapid advancement in China's humanoid robot industry.
As competition intensifies among manufacturers, humanoid robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, with industrial applications leading the charge.
Earlier this month, UBTECH announced it would work with FAW-Volkswagen, one of China's earliest joint venture automakers, to develop an unmanned car factory. This initiative aims to deploy UBTECH's industrial humanoid robot, Walker S, at FAW-Volkswagen's plant in east China's Qingdao, where the robot will undertake tasks such as bolt tightening, component assembly, and handling automotive parts.
Experts consider industrial manufacturing, commercial services, and family companionship the primary applications for humanoid robots. Among these, industrial manufacturing is poised to lead the way.
At the Innovation Conference 2024 held in Shenzhen, a technology hub and metropolis in southern China, over the weekend, Pang Jianxin, vice president of UBTECH, said that humanoid robots were increasingly penetrating critical sectors of the manufacturing industry, including automobiles, computers, communications, and consumer electronics.
""The standardized nature of industrial manufacturing makes it an ideal initial application area for humanoid robots,"" Pang said, highlighting that China's robust industrial base provides fertile ground for humanoid robot development.
Deep integration into industrial manufacturing will significantly enhance the tool manipulation and task execution capabilities of humanoid robots, Pang said.
China aims to establish a preliminary innovation system for humanoid robots by 2025, according to a guideline from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. By 2027, the country will see a secure and reliable industrial and supply chain system, and related products will be deeply integrated into the real economy.
Chinese robotics firms are at the forefront of advancing humanoid robot technology, achieving significant breakthroughs in both lower and upper limb functionalities.
LimX Dynamics has tackled the challenge of dynamic motion control in humanoid robots' lower limbs by developing specialized algorithms for motion planning, state estimation, and whole-body coordination. The company's humanoid robot now performs continuous running motions, seamlessly synchronizing arm movements with lower limb actions.
Meanwhile, in the realm of upper limb design, companies like PaXini Technology are pushing boundaries in sensitivity and coordination. PaXini's humanoid robot features tactile hands capable of distinguishing between the skin of an elderly person and that of a child.
Nie Xiangru, co-founder of PaXini Technology, emphasized the importance of tactile perception in human hands. To replicate this capability, the company independently engineered multi-dimensional surface array tactile sensors, enhancing the robot's ability to perceive and respond with a flexible sense of touch akin to human capabilities.
Xiong Rong, a professor at Zhejiang University, said that humanoid robots were designed in the human form to maximize versatility and facilitate seamless integration into social environments.
According to a report released at the First Chinese Humanoid Robot Industry Conference in April, China's market scale of the humanoid robot industry is predicted to reach 2.76 billion yuan (about 387 million U.S. dollars) in 2024 and 75 billion yuan by 2029.
Despite all the advancements, experts at the conference held over the weekend cautioned that the journey toward ubiquitous humanoid robot use is still in its infancy, particularly in complex household and commercial settings where human-robot interactions require flexibility and adaptability.
Pang said that the future development of humanoid robots required further research and development of high-performance motors, sensors and other core components.
""Perhaps new materials like artificial muscles could potentially revolutionize humanoid robot design, enabling a shift from rigid to flexible power-driven mechanisms,"" Pang added.
