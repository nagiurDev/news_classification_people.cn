GUIYANG, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- The world's first professional, multimodal large language model (LLM) for the field of lunar science has been released in China to significantly accelerate the processing speed of massive amounts of lunar data.
The new tool was debuted at the China International Big Data Industry Expo in Guiyang, the capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province, by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geochemistry and the Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group.
The Institute of Geochemistry has built a comprehensive ""digital moon"" platform with the world's most complete bank of data related to the exploration of the moon.
The LLM has created a ""smart brain"" for this digital moon. Ku Wei, vice president of the Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group, said that the LLM identifies lunar craters and remembers them by size, depth and shape to provide scientists with important bases for their study of the moon's geological evolution.
There are more than 1 million lunar craters with a diameter of over 1 kilometer, and countless smaller ones, according to Liu Jianzhong, a researcher at the Institute of Geochemistry. Identifying all lunar craters would be impossible if we were to rely on manpower alone, Liu said.
Researchers now only need to input an image of a lunar crater, and the LLM will determine its shape, size and age.
""The accuracy rate is more than 80 percent, exceeding our expectations,"" Liu said.
Scientists say that the progress and development of planetary science depends on two factors: the development of deep space exploration technology, and the levels of data processing and application.
Scientific research driven by big data is changing the human science and technology development process, and the intelligence of the digital moon will accelerate China's lunar and planetary scientific research and innovation, according to scientists.
""The LLM is like a child with a very high IQ. We train and teach the child professional things. I personally believe that this child's intelligence may have reached the university sophomore level. We will let it continue to grow and help us solve more scientific problems,"" Liu said.

BEIJING, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian satellite MISRSAT-2, a high-resolution optical remote-sensing satellite, has been orbiting more than 600 km above the ground, providing the North African country with services such as resource surveys, environmental disaster monitoring and assessment, urban planning, and crop growth evaluation for agriculture and forestry.
Launched from China in December 2023, the MISRSAT-2 was assembled and tested at the China-aided AIT (assembly, integration and test) center in Egypt, making it the first African country with a complete satellite AIT capability.
The collaboration between China and Egypt highlights the success of China-Africa space cooperation, leading to notable advancements in satellite exports as well as resource sharing, space technology exchange and infrastructure development in the field of space.
China has developed and launched several satellites for African countries, including two communication satellites for Nigeria in 2007 and 2011, respectively, a communication satellite for Algeria in 2017, a cube satellite for Ethiopia in 2019, a scientific experimental satellite for Sudan in 2019, and MISRSAT-2 for Egypt in 2023.
In 2017, China launched Algeria's first communications satellite, Alcomsat-1, which now supports broadcasting, television, broadband access, and mobile and emergency communications. The satellite's significance is so profound that its image is featured on Algeria's 500 Dinar banknotes as a national symbol of pride.
According to the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Dakar Action Plan (2022-2024), adopted by the 8th Ministerial Conference of FOCAC held in Dakar of Senegal in November 2021, China and Africa would actively work for the establishment of a China-Africa space cooperation sub-forum under the FOCAC framework.
Both sides would focus on supporting projects concerning satellite remote sensing and communications satellites to drive the development of the space industry of African countries.
ENRICHING PEOPLE'S LIVES
A network of satellites and ground stations across the African continent has advanced the space industry and significantly improved local people's lives.
For example, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) has been widely used in Africa's agriculture, urban planning, infrastructure construction and traffic services.
The first China-Africa BDS Cooperation Forum was held in Beijing in November 2021, during which the two sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in areas such as BDS, 5G and smart city construction.
In Xai-Xai city, located in Gaza Province in the south of Mozambique, local farmers use BDS-powered drones to survey fields, sow seeds, and spray pesticides. Unlike manual spraying, which covers only three to four mu (1 mu equals about 666 square meters) of land per hour, drones can spray pesticides over hundreds of mu simultaneously and operate at night.
""The precise agriculture model of 'BDS plus drones' is a beneficial attempt in the agricultural technology cooperation between China and Mozambique. Chinese agricultural technology has made an important contribution to Mozambique's food security,"" said Danilo Latifo, director of the agriculture department in Gaza Province.
In Burkina Faso, a hospital constructed during the COVID-19 pandemic used BDS high-precision services for construction surveying and mapping. The survey was completed in just six days, reducing the construction time by over half.
EMPOWERING LOCAL TALENT
In addition to offering space products and services, China also help train African talent, laying a strong foundation for the future of African space endeavors.
In early August, a training session in China welcomed 36 young technical and management professionals from developing countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia and Rwanda. They gained insights into information and communication technology, satellite internet, quality management and systems engineering within the space industry.
The session was hosted by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
""Recently, China and Egypt are carrying out cooperative projects related to the Chang'e-7 mission. It's very meaningful for me to learn something here,"" said Shimaa Soultan, a satellite payload test engineer from the Egyptian Space Agency and one of the trainees.
China and Africa have also cooperated to promote space knowledge among young people, helping Africa embrace the future of the space industry.
On Sept. 6, 2022, a live class titled ""Talk with Taikonauts"" was held at the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with students from Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia and South Africa joining the talk at sub-venues.
Three taikonauts from China's Shenzhou-14 crew -- Chen Dong, Liu Yang and Cai Xuzhe --connected with youth from these African countries via video link, sharing their experiences from the Shenzhou-14 mission.
According to the Mission of China to the African Union, since 2014, China has awarded scholarships to graduate students from eight African countries -- Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Togo, Cameroon, Mozambique, Nigeria and Sudan -- to study remote sensing and geographic information systems, satellite communication and navigation, and small satellite technology.
China has also carried out space science and technology innovation cooperation and exchange activities with universities and research institutions in countries such as Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia, Cameroon and Morocco.

Chinese researchers develop micro drone lighter than paper
 (People's Daily Online) 13:22, August 30, 2024
A team of researchers from Beihang University in Beijing have developed a micro drone that weighs only 4.21 grams, lighter than an A4 sheet of paper.
The team's research on the world's lightest and smallest solar-powered micro drone, called ""CoulombFly,"" has been published in prestigious journal Nature. This milestone achievement expands the possibilities for micro air vehicles.

The research carried out by researchers from Beihang University in Beijing on the world's lightest and smallest solar-powered micro air vehicle, called ""CoulombFly,"" is published in Nature. (yangtse.com/courtesy of the interviewee)
Shen Wei, a PhD student at Beihang University who is the lead author of the paper, has been researching this topic since his undergraduate years.
""Solar-powered drones were developed decades ago, but they were mostly large in size. In 2019, the National University of Singapore created a rotorcraft that was considered the smallest at the time. However, further downsizing proved to be a challenging task. Therefore, our research takes a different technological approach to tackle this problem,"" said Shen.

Shen said his first encounter with electrostatic motors was during his junior year, as part of a summer research project. During his graduate studies, he faced significant challenges and even thought about abandoning the topic due to the prevailing belief that electrostatic motors were not particularly useful.
During his second year of graduate school, Shen would dedicate almost his entire day to the lab. He would arrive at the lab early in the morning and return to his dormitory around 10 or 11 p.m.
""The concept of using an electrostatic motor to develop a micro drone struck me during a restless night. I contemplated the potential of coupling a propeller with an electrostatic motor to achieve flight. Drawing upon my knowledge of electrostatic motors, I was convinced that they could spin at remarkable speeds and generate ample lift, as long as I discovered an appropriate framework,"" Shen recalled.
When asked why he chose to invest so much time in developing something that could fly, Shen explained that creating a flying vehicle is undeniably impressive for students at his university, as it is a school of aeronautics. Furthermore, developing a unique micro drone is a challenging endeavor, and if successful, it would be a groundbreaking innovation on a global scale.
""I didn't hesitate to focus on utilizing an electrostatic motor for our flying vehicle. To my surprise, the experiments progressed remarkably smoothly. Within just three weeks of testing, we confirmed its ability to fly,"" Shen expressed.
As a PhD student, Shen focused on researching this area and overcame many challenges.
""However, boosting the voltage to 8 to 9 kilovolts using a booster weighing around 1 gram proved difficult. My junior colleague, Peng Jinzhe, developed the voltage boosting circuit, greatly improving our research,"" said Shen.
The research team submitted the paper to Nature on Jan. 29, 2024. According to Shen, they received provisional acceptance on March 26.

""It was a swift process. The paper was officially accepted in around May and published in July. I was responsible for designing the electrostatic motor and overall structure, while Peng tackled the voltage boosting aspect. Both of us faced significant challenges during this project. We hope that this research will inspire further studies in the field,"" said Shen.
For Shen, this paper holds great significance as it is the first publication of his academic career.
After the paper was published in Nature, Shen shared a video on video-sharing platform Bilibili. The video was specially created by the editors of Nature for this drone, and Shen added translated subtitles himself. The video quickly gained attention from viewers, with nearly 700,000 views.

Chinese scientists find new method to produce massive water with lunar soil,2024-08-30,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0830/c90000-20212251.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists find new method to produce massive water with lunar soil
By Wu Yuehui (People's Daily) 09:44, August 30, 2024
A Chinese research team recently developed a new method of massive water production through the reaction between lunar regolith and endogenous hydrogen, according to the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
The study was published in the journal The Innovation on Aug. 22, Beijing time, and is expected to provide important design basis for the construction of future lunar scientific research bases and space stations.
The research team consists of scientists from the NIMTE and the CAS Institute of Physics.

Water is a crucial resource for ensuring human survival during the development of lunar scientific research bases and future interstellar travel between the moon and the Earth.
Exploring water resources is one of the primary tasks in lunar exploration. Previous studies mainly focused on the distribution of natural water resources on the moon, which showed that various lunar minerals, such as lunar glass, plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene, contain small amounts of water. However, the water content in these minerals is extremely rare, ranging from 0.0001 percent to 0.02 percent, making it difficult to extract and utilize them on the moon.
Therefore, studying and detecting new lunar water resources and developing extraction strategies undoubtedly constitute a key focus of future lunar exploration projects.
The research team found that the solar wind has irradiated the minerals in lunar soil for billions of years and stored abundant hydrogen. When heated to high temperatures, the hydrogen reacts with the iron oxides in the minerals to form elemental iron and large amounts of water. When the temperature rises above 1,000 degrees Celsius, the lunar soil melts, and the water generated by this reaction is released as vapor.
The researchers confirmed that 1 gram of molten lunar regolith can generate 51 to 76 milligrams of water. In other words, 1 ton of lunar regolith can produce 51 to 76 kilograms of water, which can meet the daily drinking water needs of 50 people per day.
Besides, the researchers further investigated the differences in hydrogen content in different lunar minerals. They found that lunar ilmenite FeTiO3, when heated, produces large amounts of elemental iron and vapor bubbles, making it a ""water reservoir"" on the moon.
Based on multiple research findings, the research team proposed a feasible strategy for in situ extraction and utilization of lunar water resources. Experts said that this strategy will provide crucial design guidelines for the construction of future lunar scientific research bases and space stations, and its effectiveness is expected to be further confirmed by verification devices to be launched in subsequent Chang'e lunar exploration missions.

FUZHOU, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- Since the 1980s, Lin Zhanxi has led a research team on Juncao technology in China's southeastern Fujian Province. The hybrid grass technology enables fungi to grow on grass-based substrates instead of felled trees, a solution to the mushroom industry's threat to forests.
Juncao means ""mushroom"" and ""grass"" in Chinese. Its versatility is a key feature, allowing it to grow edible mushrooms, provide livestock feed and help battle desertification.
Since the 1990s, China has shared the technology with over 100 countries by opening training classes and conducting on-site demonstrations.
Lin's daughter Lin Dongmei, resigned a job in Singapore and returned home to assist her father in 2003. Lin Dongmei is now overseeing the African project of Chinese Juncao technology.
Over the years, the Juncao research team led by Lin Zhanxi has trained more than 8,000 people for African countries, helping African farmers combat poverty and promoting cooperation between China and Africa.

China makes ‘notable progress’ in energy transition over the past decade; clean energy accounts for nearly 40% of total electricity generated: white paper,2024-08-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0829/c90000-20211854.html,"Home>>
		
China makes ‘notable progress’ in energy transition over the past decade; clean energy accounts for nearly 40% of total electricity generated: white paper
By Li Xuanmin and Ma Tong (Global Times) 13:29, August 29, 2024
China has made notable progress in energy transition over the past decade, with “historical breakthroughs” achieved in green and low-carbon energy development and the country moving toward building a clean, diversified, secure and resilient energy supply system, according to a white paper titled “China’s Energy Transition” released on Thursday.
The white paper listed an array of impressive figures that underscore milestones in China’s energy transition and highlight the country’s outstanding contribution to global efforts to address climate change in the past decade.
For example, electricity generated by clean energy in 2023 accounted for nearly 40 percent of the country’s total electricity generation. Also, China’s exports of wind and photovoltaic (PV) products last year helped other countries reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 810 million tons, and the nation's new-energy industry has “added to the global energy supply and eased global inflation pressures.”
By taking proactive actions to advance its energy transition, China – as the world’s largest energy producer and consumer – is not only fulfilling its responsibility as a major country and contributing to a global community of shared future, but also demonstrating its commitment to keeping global energy industrial and supply chains open and stable, the white paper said.
It also stressed that China opposes all forms of unilateralism or protectionism, and rejects all forms of “decoupling” and the “small yard and high fence” approach, while calling for major countries to “act in a responsible manner by ensuring global energy security, promoting green development and maintaining market order.”
According to the white paper, China has been fast tracking clean energy development and there’s a growing share of green energy in China’s energy mix.
For example, the share of clean energy consumption reached 26.4 percent of China’s total energy use in 2023, up 10.9 percentage points from 2013. Meanwhile, by the end of 2023, China’s cumulative installed capacities of wind and PV power were an eleven-fold increase over the past decade.
Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times that over the past decade, China has led the global energy transition, not only in the speed of its transformation but also in the expansion of new-energy production capacity and output. The world’s second-largest economy is steadily marching toward its “dual carbon” goal of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and attaining carbon neutrality by 2060.
“China’s successful energy transition plays an exemplary role for developing countries and sets a global model,” Lin said. He noted the country’s significant contributions to the development of global wind power, solar photovoltaic energy and electric vehicles are well-recognized, with cost-effective equipment and large-scale supply offering many nations a low-cost pathway to their own energy transitions.
China’s green energy development has become an engine for the global energy transition, the white paper said.
The white paper cited data from the International Energy Agency as saying that from 2014 to 2023, the global share of non-fossil fuels in energy consumption rose from 13.6 percent to 18.5 percent, with China contributing 45.2 percent to this increase. Over the past decade, the average cost per kilowatt-hour of global wind power projects has decreased by more than 60 percent, and PV power projects by more than 80 percent. The reductions are largely attributable to China’s efforts.
Observers said that these upbeat figures show that China’s global competitiveness in renewable energy comes from continuous innovation and a complete industrial chain. It also sounds the alarm to certain Western countries that have stepped up a relentless crackdown against China’s new-energy exports, warning them that “this politicization of economic issues would heavily hinder the global green transition, hinder energy structure optimization, and delay climate change efforts.”
The white paper also said that despite various forms of rising “green barriers” and more challenges, China upholds open and mutually beneficial cooperation, and is committed to keeping global energy industrial and supply chains stable and maintaining energy security in an open environment.
“China is ready to work with other countries to uphold the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, while working toward the targets outlined by the Paris Agreement, as it helps to build a fair and rational global climate governance system directed toward cooperation and mutual benefit,” the white paper said.
It also urged developed countries to provide funding, technology, and capacity-building support for renewable energy deployment in developing countries, and help address the dual challenges of energy supply security and the green and low-carbon energy transition.

Researchers develop technologies to better protect 5,000-year-old ruin site
 (Xinhua) 16:50, August 28, 2024
LANZHOU, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently unveiled a series of technological methods based on a six-year-long program to effectively address the issue of high humidity in site museums, creating a more suitable preservation environment for cultural relics.
The program, carried out at the Dadiwan Site, a Neolithic site dated approximately 8,000 to 4,800 years ago, in Qin'an County, northwest China's Gansu Province, involved researchers from Dunhuang Academy and Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources (NIEER) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The site is one of the largest and best-preserved Neolithic settlement sites discovered in China to date.
The iconic Dadiwan F901 site, boasting a history of over 5,000 years and covering an area of 420 square meters, is the largest and most intricately crafted large-scale housing structure from China's prehistoric era. Early renovation efforts, incorporating a sealed glass curtain wall, led to a continuous rise in relative humidity within the site, triggering outbreaks of microbial diseases.
Researchers conducted on-site real-time environmental monitoring and numerical simulation to assess the ventilation effectiveness and relative humidity changes before and after multiple interior modifications of the F901 site.
The results indicate that the fully enclosed glass curtain wall can suppress the dependence of indoor humidity fluctuations on external weather fluctuations but has generated unintended consequences, leading to increased air relative humidity and even reaching saturation in the museum space. The strategic deployment of louvered windows and duct fans proved effective in enhancing internal airflow dynamics and overall air exchange capacity.
Liu Benli, researcher at the NIEER and the first author of the study, said that this study is of great significance for alleviating the deterioration problem of enclosed exhibition halls of earthen relics. The study was recently published in the international journal of Heritage Science.

Chinese scientists discover new gene that regulates lifespan
 (Global Times) 16:48, August 28, 2024
Chinese scientists have discovered a new gene, OSER1, that regulates lifespan. This breakthrough provides a novel scientific basis for the study of extending human lifespans.
The team studied the mechanism of action in various species such as silkworms, nematodes, and fruit flies. As a target gene of the longevity gene FOXO, OSER1's impact on lifespan has been supported by human subject research results.
This breakthrough finding was made by Dai Fangyin’s team from the National Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Insect Resources at Southwest University and scientists from abroad. The results have been published in the international academic journal ""Nature Communications.""
FOXO is one of the few confirmed human longevity genes. It affects lifespan by regulating pathways related to aging, but the targets mediating these effects are largely unknown.
The research team conducted interference experiments on 42 potential direct target genes of the FOXO gene in silkworms, which are similar to genes in nematodes. They discovered that down-regulating the expression of 7 genes significantly shortened the lifespan of nematodes, while down-regulating 3 genes extended their lifespan. Crucially, gene OSER1 had the most significant impact on lifespan when its expression was reduced.
“OSER1 is present in the genomes of various species including nematodes, silkworms, fruit flies, zebrafish, African clawed frogs, mice, rhesus monkeys, and humans,” said Song Jiangbo from the National Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Insect Resource at Southwest University, who is also a co-author of the paper.
The study revealed that increasing the expression of OSER1 in silkworms, nematodes, and fruit flies led to a significant extension of their lifespan. This discovery could have implications for understanding the aging process and potentially developing interventions to increase lifespan in other species, including humans.
Research findings on human subjects have confirmed that OSER1 plays a role in determining the human lifespan, according to Song. The study revealed that individuals over 90 years old had 49 common single nucleotide variations in the OSER1 gene, with seven of them showing a significant link to longevity when compared to a younger control group.

New energy vehicles from S China's Guangxi gain firmer foothold overseas
 (People's Daily Online) 14:41, August 28, 2024
Small and nimble new energy vehicles (NEV) are a common sight on the streets of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. With a length of just around 2 meters, these vehicles are half the size of a regular car, making them a convenient mode of transportation for shopping or picking up children from school.
The NEVs, developed and manufactured by Chinese automobile manufacturer SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW) in Liuzhou city of Guangxi, have reached overseas markets, in particular gaining popularity in the Southeast Asian market.

The automobile industry is an important pillar industry in Guangxi. In the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, the region's automotive industry is seizing opportunities, further deepening reform, and placing equal emphasis on innovation and cooperation in an effort to achieve innovative, high-quality and sustainable development.
Over the years, SGMW has been expanding its presence in the overseas market. For example, the company attended the GAIKINDO Indonesia International Auto Show in July. SGMW received widespread acclaim and was one of the highlights of the show, with local companies signing contracts to purchase the company's NEVs in bulk. Efforts like this have allowed SGMW's total export volume to reach 1 million. In 2023, the company exported 24,094 NEVs, increasing 165 percent year on year.
The company's rich product portfolio and strong competitiveness are a result of its intelligent manufacturing strength, which is essential for upgrading and innovating industrial capabilities.
By breaking free from the limitations of traditional assembly line models, SGMW's ""smart island"" factory, based on lean and modular manufacturing, has revolutionized the manufacturing process.
""The 'smart island' factory, with the production line, software and hardware independently developed and designed by us, can automatically adapt its production program to different vehicle models and configurations. This allows us to better cater to the evolving market demands of producing multiple varieties in small batches,"" said Xiao Xiao, SGMW's ""smart island"" factory's engineering director of intelligent manufacturing.

SGMW embarked on the development of NEV technology in 2012. In the first 12 years, the company was able to obtain over 700 patents. However, just from 2023 to today the company managed to double the total number of patents to 1,650.
Of the 1,650 patents, most are in areas such as intelligent connected vehicles, the motor, battery and electric control system, and dual model hybrid technology.
SGMW of course isn't the only Guangxi automotive company using innovative practices and technology.
In 2023, Guangxi Automobile Group, with decades of experience in the traditional automobile industry, rose to the challenge and continuously upgraded its products, achieving breakthroughs in the production of core components for NEVs.
The development and production of the co-axial electric drive axle took the company less than a year and obtained 10 patents, making the company the first of its kind in the country to mass produce such a product for NEVs.

""Core technology has opened up overseas markets for us,"" said He Hongyong, general manager of the chassis division at Guangxi Automobile Group. Today, the company's automotive components have reached markets in India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.
The emergence of new quality productive forces has also injected new vitality into Guangxi's automobile industry.
In Liuzhou, an NEV industrial chain targeting the ASEAN market is rapidly being established. Additionally, the capital city of Nanning is prioritizing the development of the new energy battery industry as a core and leading industry.
Over the past two years, Nanning has emerged as a hub for the new energy battery industry. Companies like BYD have established themselves as key players.
Nanning ranked 36th on the Hurun Research Institute's 2023 list of the top 50 cities in China with the highest concentration of new energy companies.
In early August, a complete automobile production line by Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor Co., Ltd., was exported from Liuzhou to Cambodia. This marked the first time that Liuzhou exported a complete automobile production line.
Prior to this, the company had received a multitude of inquiries from clients overseas, seeking assistance in establishing complete vehicle production lines for local assembly.
Deepening reforms and expanding openness have always been the guiding principles and foundations for the development of China's automotive industry. Leveraging innovation to drive industrial transformation, Guangxi's automotive industry is rapidly growing, and the blueprint for cultivating an internationally competitive NEV industry cluster is gradually becoming a reality.

As China strives for technological innovation represented by intelligent connected vehicles and autonomous driving, it has created a distinctive Chinese innovation model, with government departments, enterprises, and research institutions collaborating closely and policies being drafted to support the nation's technological growth, said experts, entrepreneurs, and officials.
Zhao Xiangmo, vice-chairman of the China Society of Automotive Engineers, said that with the development of new energy vehicles and self-driving tech, the automotive industry is undergoing a qualitative change.
As self-driving vehicles become more prominent, China's solution is vehicle-road-cloud integration, which is a technology more complex than the single-vehicle intelligence explored by the United States 30 years ago, said Zhao, who is also president of the Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology in Shaanxi province.
Vehicle-road-cloud integration uses artificial intelligence and technologies such as cellular vehicle-to-everything, or C-V2X, and 5G to enable seamless collaboration between humans, vehicles, roads, and cloud systems.
Zhao attributes China's success in the field of intelligent driving to its unique path of independent innovation, which has mobilized various forces from government departments, automotive companies, cloud computing enterprises, and research institutions to achieve collaborative development under a top-level framework.
""This is a vast technological system involving vehicle, road, internet, and cloud computing, in which each segment can drive an industry. It's impossible to proceed without teamwork. This is also a typical area where new quality productive forces are concentrated,"" he said.
The third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held last month emphasized the need to coordinate the construction of various scientific and technological innovation platforms, encourage and regulate the development of new research and development institutions, leverage the leading role of China's huge market, strengthen the coordination of innovative resources and organizational strength, and promote the integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation.
In September 2020, the Beijing municipal government decided to establish the world's first high-level autonomous driving demonstration zone, featuring vehicle-road-cloud integration, in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area.
Beijing Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Technology Co was set up as the operating platform, in conjunction with the National Innovation Center of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles and other research and development institutions, forming a structure involving government departments, academia, industries, and investors among other entities.
Pony.ai, an autonomous driving research and development company that started operating in Silicon Valley in 2016, established its first domestic research center in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area in 2017, becoming one of the first companies to have a presence in the demonstration zone.
""The construction of the demonstration zone has accelerated Pony.ai's research and testing,"" said Zhang Ning, vice-president of the company and head of its Beijing research center. ""On average, there is a technological breakthrough or policy move every three months — a pace that is exhilarating.""
One of Pony.ai's main businesses involves Robotaxi, an autonomous taxi service. In 2018, the company obtained a testing license and began conducting trial runs with a safety officer in the driver's seat. In April 2021, the officer moved to the passenger seat; in July 2022, to the back seat; and by the end of that year, ""fully driverless"" tests were successfully conducted.
""After accumulating enough testing data, following evaluation by the demonstration zone's management committee, Pony.ai started providing Robotaxi services for a fee since last year. Now, anyone in the demonstration zone can hail a ride in these taxis using their mobile phone,"" Zhang said.
Currently, only China and the US have achieved commercial operation of self-driving taxis, he noted. While Google's Waymo has undergone 15 years of development, China has made rapid progress in the past five years, thanks to the close cooperation between government departments, enterprises, and research institutions.
""The resonance between policy and technological innovation is crucial. The government acts as a guiding beacon, boosting the confidence of enterprises and promoting technological development through funding and policies. This is how the Robotaxi has achieved such rapid development in such a short time,"" Zhang said.
""The testing data accumulated by enterprises serves as a reference for government policymaking, with the government overseeing and making decisions to share the risks with enterprises,"" he added.
Zhang said he believes that the potential of developing the Robotaxi service in China's major cities is at least 10 times greater than in US cities such as San Francisco, because the population in major Chinese cities is larger.
""Moreover, China's roads are more complex. After training in such situations, the nation's autonomous driving tech will be far more competitive when exported to other countries,"" he said.
In the field of autonomous driving, China's commercialization landscape and future market will be much larger than those of the US, he added.
On public roads, Pony.ai has achieved 35 million kilometers of real-world autonomous driving efficiency. ""It's equivalent to the driving experience of dozens of ordinary drivers in a lifetime,"" Zhang said, adding that data shows Robotaxis are 10 times safer than taxis driven by humans.
Yuan Chengyin, director and general manager of the National New Energy Vehicle Technology Innovation Center, said: ""In the development process of intelligent driving in China, what I deeply appreciate is the Chinese innovation model of tackling key issues. It's somewhat like passing a baton in foreign countries, but under our government initiatives it requires integrating all resources to focus fully on completing a task with a clear purpose and determination.""
Yuan, who is also secretary-general of the China Automotive Chip Industry Innovation Strategic Alliance, said that this year, the percentage of car chips produced domestically for China's use will increase from 5 percent to 20 percent.
Over the past four years, the demonstration zone in Beijing has introduced more than 30 companies for research and development of autonomous driving tech and intelligent connected functions, deploying over 800 autonomous vehicles for testing, resulting in more than 60 standard achievements, according to the zone's management committee.
The demonstration zone has established the nation's first domestic standard system for vehicle-road-cloud integration, with vehicles such as self-driving taxis, unmanned delivery vans, and unmanned cleaning trucks already in operation.
