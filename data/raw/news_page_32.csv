Stanford AI team apologizes for plagiarizing Chinese university's model
 (Xinhua) 14:43, June 05, 2024
SAN FRANCISCO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- ""'Fake it before you make it' is an ignoble product of Silicon Valley,"" said Christopher Manning, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University, commenting on some researchers at the university who plagiarized the achievements by institutions such as China's Tsinghua University.
On May 29, a research team at Stanford University released a large model called Llama3-V, claiming it can achieve the same effects as large models such as GPT-4V with a pre-training cost of only 500 U.S. dollars. The news was widely spread on social media and in the academic community of artificial intelligence.
However, industry insiders soon suspected that the Standford team plagiarized the MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 large model released by Tsinghua University and other Chinese institutions.
Both Llama3-V and the MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 large model are based on the open-source Llama3 large model. Still, the team in Tsinghua conducted unique training, including using the ""Tsinghua Bamboo Slips,"" a collection of Chinese texts written on strips of bamboo which date back to the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.), to train the model to recognize ancient Chinese characters.
Tests show that the model released by the Stanford University team can also recognize the ""Tsinghua Bamboo Slips.""
""We are quite sure that the Stanford team has plagiarized our big model research results,"" Liu Zhiyuan, a tenured associate professor of the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, told Xinhua.
""The data we scanned and annotated word by word from the 'Tsinghua Bamboo Slips' has never been made public, and Llama3-V has shown the same ability to identify the 'Tsinghua Bamboo Slips', even the error examples are the same,"" said Liu, who is also a member of the Tsinghua big model team.
As doubt accumulated, the Stanford team deleted the database and promotion articles on the Internet, Liu said, adding ""from the evidence and their reactions, the nature of plagiarism has been relatively confirmed.""
Following Manning's criticism, two members of the Stanford team, Aksh Garg and Siddharth Sharma, formally apologized on social media.
""We've taken all references to Llama3-V down and we apologize once again for the inconvenience we may have caused,"" they said.
Amid the current AI boom, this incident has aroused widespread attention. It shows that although the United States is leading in AI technologies overall, it is far from omnipotent.
The Silicon Valley where Stanford University is located is considered to be the center of innovation in the United States. While having nurtured many advanced technologies, it has also cultivated a negative culture including the ""fake it till you make it"" ethos.
For example, Elizabeth Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford University to start a business, boasted that she had a disruptive technology that could draw finger blood to test diseases like cancers. She was regarded as a female Steve Jobs but was later found to have fooled everyone and was sentenced to imprisonment for fraud.
When Google's artificial intelligence model Gemini Pro was asked in Chinese who it was, it would answer that it was ""Ernie Bot"", a Chinese big model developed by Baidu. Industry insiders believe that the reason may be that Google ""referenced"" the relevant data of the large model ""Ernie Bot"" when training its large model.
""China's AI research has an increasing influence,"" Liu said, noting the plagiarism incident reflects that ""our innovative achievements are attracting international attention.""
Overall, there is still a significant gap between China's research level and the world's top level, but in some specific segments such as AI innovation, China has rapidly grown into an important promoter, he added.

Robot fuels hydrogen-powered trains
 (Xinhua) 14:30, June 05, 2024
HOHHOT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- As a heavy-haul train entered a hydrogen fueling station, an automatic robot extended its arm, took out the hydrogenation nozzle and began refueling the train.
The hydrogen fueling station for CHN Energy's heavy-haul trains recently started commercial operation in Batuta, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, north China.
The station is equipped with a low-temperature resistant automatic hydrogenation robot and a high-flow hydrogenation machine, independently developed and manufactured in China.
The robot can refuel a hydrogen-powered train within 30 minutes, which will power the train for eight hours, according to CHN Energy, which added that the train boasts a range of 800 kilometers before it needs refueling.
The robot can not only achieve all-weather continuous operation and large flow automatic hydrogenation at temperatures as low as minus 25 degrees Celsius, but also ensure safe and stable operation, effectively reduce personnel errors, control safety risks and save operational costs.
Boasting explosion-proof, electronic control and air-operation systems, the robot's anti-interference 3D camera combination can conduct visual positioning of moving targets.
Under the outdoor lighting, it can automatically complete visual identification and fueling without manual intervention, said Zhang Kai, a technician at the hydrogen fueling station.
The fault self-diagnosis and alarm functions can monitor the operating environment of both trains and the robot in real time and ensure a reliable, stable and safe hydrogen fueling service.
The robot has passed strict explosion-proof tests and achieved certificate in this regard, said Zhang.
Research and development of the automatic hydrogenation robot, which was designed to serve high-power hydrogen trains, started in 2022.
CHN Energy, one of the robot's developers, promised to continue promoting the application of intelligent robot technology and to extend the research on automatic petrol refueling robots and non-petrol service robots.
From 2015 to 2022, China's annual production of industrial robots soared from 33,000 units to 443,000 units. The latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows that the production volume in the first quarter of this year reached 120,000 units.
After rapid development in recent years, China's industrial robot industry has made significant strides in both product technology and practical application.

KATHMANDU/SHENZHEN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- DJI has successfully completed the first-ever drone delivery tests on Mount Qomolangma from the Nepali side, paving the way for facilitating high-altitude mountaineering, emergency rescue and environmental protection operations, the Chinese drone maker announced Wednesday.
A DJI FlyCart 30 was used in the April tests, during which three oxygen bottles and 1.5 kg of other supplies were flown from the Base Camp (at an altitude of 5,364 meters) to Camp 1 (at about 6,000 meters) of the world's highest peak, and trash was carried down on the return trip.
The treacherous Khumbu Icefall lies just between the Base Camp and Camp 1, which is covered with ice blocks and considered very dangerous because of frequent avalanches.
""We need to spend 6 to 8 hours each day walking through this icefall,"" said Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, a climbing guide with Imagine Nepal Trek and Expeditions. ""Last year I lost three Sherpas. If we're not lucky, if our time is not right, we lose our life there.""
The DJI drone could carry 15 kg of supplies between the camps in 12 minutes for a round trip, day or night, according to the drone maker.
During the tests, FlyCart 30 flew as high as 6,191.8 meters on Mount Qomolangma situated on the border of Nepal and China and could carry a 15 kg payload steadily at an altitude of 6,000 meters.
""The ability to safely transport equipment, supplies and waste by drone has the potential to revolutionize Mount Qomolangma mountaineering logistics, facilitate trash clean-up efforts and improve safety for all involved,"" said Christina Zhang, senior corporate strategy director at DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen in southern China's Guangdong Province.
Following the tests, a Nepali drone company was contracted to establish drone delivery operations on Mount Qomolangma from May 22.
The DJI drone was used to bring down trash like ropes and ladders on May 29, and ""it can carry 30 kg,"" said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of Nepal's Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, where Mount Qomolangma is situated.
""We plan to use it on Mount Ama Dablam"" in the fall climbing season, Bhusal said of the DJI drone.
The 6,812-meter-high Mount Ama Dablam lies in the eastern Himalayan range of Nepal.

China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe takes off from moon with first samples from lunar far side,2024-06-05,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0605/c90000-20178126.html,"Home>>
		
China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe takes off from moon with first samples from lunar far side
By Yu Sinan, Liu Shiyao, Pang Dan (People's Daily) 09:45, June 05, 2024
The ascender of China's Chang'e-6 probe lifted off from lunar surface on June 4, carrying samples collected from the moon's far side, an unprecedented feat in human lunar exploration history. Now it has entered a preset orbit around the moon.
The probe previously landed at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin on the far side of the moon at 6:23 a.m., on June 2.
The lander-ascender combination of the Chang'e-6 probe touched down after reducing its relative speed to zero in 15 minutes, under the precise control of the Beijing Aerospace Control Center.

Chang'e-6 consists of an orbiter, a returner, a lander and an ascender. Since its launch on May 3 this year, it has been staying in orbit for about 30 days.
Before its landing, the lander-ascender combination separated from the orbiter-returner combination that kept flying around the moon.
Apart from making a soft landing on the far side of the moon, Chang'e-6 would also collect lunar soil beyond the moon's visible face, said Ge Ping, spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission.
According to him, the mission involves many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty, and manifests the wisdom of scientists.
Landing on the far side of the moon requires choosing the right location first. Compared to the near side of the moon where Chang'e-5 landed, the far side features a more rugged topography. The pre-selected landing area, the SPA Basin, is generally lower in elevation and has a higher density of impact craters, which posed greater challenges for site selection as the terrain's shadows and obstructions are unfavorable for lighting and surveys.
In order to find an ideal landing site, the development team of Chang'e-6 drew upon previous experience in site selection and established a set of methods tailored for landing on the far side of the moon, said a developer of Chang'e-6 from China Academy of Space Technology (CAST).
For example, researchers utilized 7-meter resolution orthoimages of the entire lunar surface and 20-meter resolution digital elevation models produced from data obtained by the Chang'e-2 probe to identify relatively flat areas with gentle slopes as potential landing sites for Chang'e-6, the developer told People's Daily.
Since the landing site of Chang'e-6 is on the far side of the moon, the landing process couldn't be observed from Earth. Even though the probe is capable of autonomous landing, it is crucial to have the ability to monitor real-time data and issue control commands for keeping the ""family on Earth"" informed about the mission's progress.
In March this year, China's Queqiao-2 relay satellite was sent to orbit in advance to ensure that Chang'e-6 would not ""get lost"" on the far side of the moon, building a bridge for Earth-moon communications.

Two rounds of obstacle avoidance were crucial for the landing of Chang'e-6 on the far side of the moon.
An expert told People's Daily that under the intelligent and autonomous control of the guidance, navigation and control system, the lander-ascender combination would rapidly adjust its attitude while descending, take photos of and analyze the pre-selected landing area, and avoid large obstacles, thereby selecting the most proper landing site. The system would then order the lander-ascender combination to fly towards the selected area. This is the first round of obstacle avoidance, also known as ""general avoidance.""
At a predetermined altitude closer to the lunar surface, the lander-ascender combination would execute a critical short hovering phase, take additional photos of the surface, accurately avoid obstacles, and pinpoint the final landing site. This is the second round of obstacle avoidance, known as ""targeted avoidance."" Afterwards, it would descend vertically and slowly.
The combination of “general avoidance” and ""targeted avoidance"" is a unique technology developed by China, which enables autonomous operation during the landing process. The successful landing of Chang'e-6 has advanced this technology.
The key to landing is to achieve a smooth touchdown. The landing of the lander-ascender combination would generate considerable impact loads. Therefore, a corresponding buffer mechanism must be designed to ensure the probe does not topple over or sink into the surface. For this purpose, the CAST has customized four lightweight and high-strength ""legs"" for Chang'e-6.
According to experts, each of the landing legs consists of a main leg, two secondary legs, and a foot pad. Prior to landing, the main and secondary legs, made of a new type of high-strength alloy material with special filling, would work collaboratively to support the body of the probe, transmitting and absorbing impact forces.
After landing, Chang'e-6 transmitted back images of the landing site and began its sample-retrieving operations on the far side of the moon. The retrieving operations adopted two methods of moon sampling, which included using a drill to collect subsurface samples and grabbing samples on the surface with a robotic arm.
It is reported that after completing its work on the lunar surface, Chang'e-6 would embark on its journey back home. It is scheduled to land in a designated area in north China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, thus concluding its trip lasting more than 50 days.

China's new FuXi AI weather model eyes maritime transportation, new energy sector
 (Xinhua) 09:34, June 05, 2024
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have upgraded an AI-powered large model, forming part of the FuXi series, for climate and weather forecasting, featuring improved accuracy. They are exploring the model's application in maritime and aviation transportation, and the new energy sector.
The Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science (SAIS) and Fudan University unveiled the upgraded model, known as FuXi 2.0, on Monday. FuXi 2.0 is the first global large weather model for weather routing, according to a press release of the university.
""FuXi-Subseasonal,"" the first model of the FuXi series, was unveiled during the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in December 2023. It represented a significant advancement in AI climate modeling, as it extended the forecasting range to 42 days.
Compared to ""FuXi-Subseasonal,"" FuXi 2.0 has made progress in terms of mid-term weather forecasting models and sub-seasonal models, targeting industries such as new energy, and aviation and maritime transportation, said Li Hao, who leads the SAIS earth science research team.
Through cooperation with China COSCO Shipping Cooperation Limited, Li said FuXi 2.0 is capable of delivering hourly high-resolution forecasts for a period of 15 days. The new model incorporates elements such as wind, waves, swells, and sea surface temperature to enhance the accuracy of predictions for wind, waves, currents, and visibility worldwide.
Li underscored FuXi 2.0's significant progress in prediction accuracy for extreme weather phenomena like typhoons, heavy precipitation, and other hazardous conditions.
FuXi 2.0 is expected to help reduce long-term dependence on foreign service providers for offshore weather routing, he said.
In the new energy sector, FuXi 2.0 offers more accurate forecasts concerning wind speed, solar irradiance and power generation to optimize the efficiency of wind and solar power generation, balancing of the grid load, and reduction of wind and solar power curtailment.
""It can be seen as an intelligent navigation system for wind and solar farms,"" said Li.
Feng Shuhai, an expert with the Electric Power Automation Department of China Electric Power Research Institute, praised FuXi 2.0 for its accurate forecasts of wind speed and solar irradiance.
It can improve the efficiency of power scheduling and management. ""We look forward to FuXi's growth and the collective efforts to reduce operating costs in the power industry,"" said Feng.
Meanwhile, FuXi 2.0 has pioneered the development of meteorological parameters such as low cloud cover and total cloud cover, which are of great concern to the aviation industry.
Therefore, it is able to help predict various weather phenomena that may be encountered during flights, such as icing, turbulence, and uneven light conditions, improving flight experiences and reducing costs, said Li.
Looking at the future, Li said the research team plans to develop a large model of the Earth system to provide forecasts concerning the atmosphere, ocean, land surface and cryosphere, and explore forecasts in the categories of atmospheric pollution and climate risks.

New study reveals continuous lake expansion on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau,2024-06-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0604/c90000-20177798.html,"Home>>
		
New study reveals continuous lake expansion on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau
 (Xinhua) 14:16, June 04, 2024
LANZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A new study has revealed that lakes on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau have expanded by more than 10,000 square kilometers over the past 30 years, according to the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The study is led by Zhang Guoqing, a researcher at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research. The study results have been published in the journal Nature Geoscience, providing scientific guidance for the future development planning of the plateau.
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is known as the ""Water Tower of Asia."" Over the past 50 years, the lakes have experienced rapid expansion, driven by a complex interplay of factors, according to Zhang.
The researchers integrated field surveys, remote sensing observations and numerical modeling to assess future changes in lake surface area, water level and water volume on the plateau. They also assessed the ensuing risks to critical infrastructure, human settlements and key ecosystem components.
The findings of the study suggest that, by 2100, even under a low-emissions scenario, the surface area of endorheic lakes on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau will increase by over 50 percent and water levels will rise by around 10 meters relative to 2020.
This expansion represents approximately a fourfold increase in water storage compared with the period from the 1970s to 2020, according to the study.
The study highlights the urgent need for water hazard mitigation and management across the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, Zhang said.

China's Chang'e 6 mission has completed the most important part of its lunar adventure as its sample-loaded ascender lifted off from the moon's far side on Tuesday morning.
According to the China National Space Administration, the ascender, one of the four major components of the Chang'e 6 robotic probe, started its ascent engine at 7:38 am and flew nearly 6 minutes before reaching a lunar orbit.
The mission has collected lunar samples in the past two days, and they are sealed inside a container on the ascender.
The space administration said the ascender's return to lunar orbit marked the successful completion of the first sampling and liftoff operations on the moon's far side by any country.
The Chang'e 6 spacecraft, representing the world's first attempt to bring samples from the lunar far side back to Earth, was launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket on May 3 from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province. It entered lunar orbit on May 8.
The 8.35-metric-ton probe consists of four major components — an orbiter, a lander, an ascender, and a reentry capsule.

After a host of sophisticated maneuvers, the Chang'e 6 lander touched down on the far side on Sunday morning and soon started using a scoop to grab surface regolith and a drill for subsurface material.
At the same time, several mission payloads, including a panoramic camera, a lunar mineralogical spectrometer, and a lunar soil composition analytical instrument, were activated for operation on the moon. The results of their survey will play significant roles in the measurement and study of the moon's landscapes, mineral compositions as well as shallow structures, according to the space administration.
Moreover, three European scientific apparatuses carried by the Chang'e 6 landing craft — a radon-measuring instrument from France's national space agency, a dedicated negative ion instrument developed by the Swedish Institute of Space Physics with support from the European Space Agency, and a passive laser retroreflector from Italy's National Institute for Nuclear Physics — worked on the lunar surface over the past two days, said the space administration.
After the surface collection task finished, a Chinese national flag was unfolded on the lander, becoming the first national flag of any nation to be shown on the lunar far side.
 

An image provided by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) shows China's national flag unfolded on the lander of Chang'e 6, becoming the first national flag of any nation to be shown on the lunar far side.
In addition, a mini rover carrying a special camera was released from the lander and moved around the lander to take its pictures, according to the administration.
In the next stage, the ascender is set to remain in the lunar orbit for a certain period of time and then rendezvous and dock with the combination of orbiter and reentry capsule. It will transfer the sample container to the reentry capsule before departing.
In the final part of the 53-day mission, the combination will fly away from the lunar orbit and return to the Earth's orbit, where the pair will break up and the reentry capsule will conduct a host of complicated maneuvers to return to the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, according to the mission plan.

In less than five years, Synceres Biosciences, a high-tech startup located in the Guangming Science City, a cluster of scientific and technological facilities in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong province, has grown into a ""rising star"" valued at over 1 billion yuan ($137.95 million) in the synthetic biology industry.
It has developed from a company initially staffed with two or three employees to a high-tech pioneer drawing nearly 300 million yuan in funding and hiring nearly 200 employees, turning from a research-focused organization publishing papers in prestigious journals like Nature to a manufacturer that sells products globally.
This remarkable progress would not have been possible without the supportive innovation ecosystem fostered by the Guangming Science City.
Luo Xiaozhou, co-founder of Synceres Biosciences, showed People's Daily reporters around at the Industrial Innovation Center for Engineering Biology (hereafter referred to as the ""Innovation Center""), which was co-established by the People's Government of Guangming District of Shenzhen and the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). It helps build the Guangming Science City into a national synthetic biology industry hub, also where Luo's company is located.
He explained that the Innovation Center enables startups not only to undertake basic research but also to commercialize their findings into actual products. Furthermore, he added, there is an industrialization park nearby where companies can scale up to mass production.
""A complete innovation chain is our greatest strength,"" he told People's Daily.
As a pilot zone for the comprehensive national science center in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), the Guangming Science City aims to build itself into a source of original innovation in basic research and a test bed for efficient commercialization of technologies.

Based on major scientific and technological innovation facilities and institutions, the Guangming Science City has established engineering and technological innovation centers, and built a model of ""fostering innovation upstairs and nurturing entrepreneurship downstairs"" in the Innovation Center that serves enterprises from scientific research to industrial application.
On the first floor of the Innovation Center, the latest products developed by synthetic biology enterprises are exhibited, including Synceres Biosciences, Bontac Bio-engineering, and Cytorola Biomedical.
Luo Wei, a researcher with the Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology (iSynBio), a scientific research institute led by SIAT, told People's Daily that researchers gather here for original innovations, striving to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields of the synthetic biology industry.
Besides, business incubators also cluster here for engineering development and pilot-scale commercialization of the original innovations, thus driving the industrial application of scientific and technological achievements, Luo Wei added.
""With researchers and companies working side-by-side, a single creative spark could ignite a new idea, and commercialization bottlenecks could be cleared, which greatly shortens the cycle for converting research into viable products,"" said Luo Wei.
Luo Xiaozhou, apart from being a researcher at the iSynBio of SIAT, is also an entrepreneur at the Innovation Center. Through an equity investment model, the SIAT can transfer its research achievements to Synceres Biosciences. They have also established a joint lab, sharing research resources and talent to promote the deep integration of the innovation, industrial, capital, and talent chains.
Last November, a major scientific and technological infrastructure for synthetic biology research was launched in the Guangming Science City, providing further momentum for enterprises here. The new products launched by Synceres Biosciences this year were exactly developed with its support.

To promote the development of the synthetic biology industry, the Guangming Science City has rolled out targeted policies, set up a special fund to support industry development, built specialized industrial parks, and established a relatively complete industrial ecosystem. Thanks to these efforts, the local synthetic biology industry has rapidly developed into a cluster of over 90 companies with a total value of around 27 billion yuan in just a few years.
In the Guangming Science City, the development model of ""fostering innovation upstairs and nurturing entrepreneurship downstairs"" is being vigorously promoted, which is based on the 24 major scientific and technological innovation facilities and institutions established there, including a major scientific and technological infrastructure for brain analysis and brain simulation, a materials genome facility, and the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation. This model is evolving into various innovative ecosystems tailored to local conditions.
Leveraging the major scientific and technological infrastructure for brain analysis and brain simulation, a team led by researcher Wei Pengfei with the Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute of SIAT has developed mature technologies in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) devices. These technologies have been invested in Shenzhen Zhongkehuayi Technology Co., Ltd., or Neuroplus, which was initially set up at the Shenzhen Guangming Industrial Innovation Center for Brain Science and Technology.
""High-level scientific research and clinical research institutions, upstream and downstream enterprises, as well as professional investment and financing institutions are clustered here, forming an innovative brain science alliance. Researchers and entrepreneurs have become 'next-door neighbors', helping startups grow rapidly,"" said Wei.
According to Wei, Neuroplus has ""graduated"" from the Shenzhen Guangming Industrial Innovation Center for Brain Science and Technology and moved to another brain science and brain-inspired intelligence industrial park.
So far, the SIAT has incubated 14 companies related to brain science with a total value exceeding 2.2 billion yuan.
""While driving the industrial application of technologies, Guangdong province has taken a forward-looking approach to developing biological manufacturing. We have established world-leading scientific and technological infrastructure for synthetic biology and created an innovative service platform for biological manufacturing. In the past three years, half of Chinese synthetic biology companies have settled in Guangdong,"" said an official with the Guangdong Provincial Development and Reform Commission.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The ascender of China's Chang'e-6 probe lifted off from lunar surface on Tuesday morning, carrying samples collected from the moon's far side, an unprecedented feat in human lunar exploration history.
The ascender has entered a preset orbit around the moon, said the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
The Chang'e-6 probe, comprising an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner -- like its predecessor Chang'e-5 -- was launched on May 3. Its lander-ascender combination touched down at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin on June 2.
The spacecraft finished its intelligent and rapid sampling work, and the samples were stowed in a container inside the ascender of the probe as planned, the CNSA said.
During sampling and packaging, researchers conducted simulated sampling in a ground lab, based on the detection data sent back by the Queqiao-2 relay satellite, providing important support for decision-making and operations in every link.
""The mission has withstood the test of high temperature on the far side of the moon,"" the CNSA said.
It adopted two methods of moon sampling, including using a drill to collect subsurface samples and grabbing samples on the surface with a robotic arm. It automatically gathered diverse samples at different sites.
The multiple payloads installed on the lander, including the landing camera, panoramic camera, lunar soil structure detector and lunar mineral spectrum analyzer, worked well and carried out scientific exploration as planned, the CNSA said.
The lunar soil structure detector analyzed and judged the underground lunar soil structure of the sampling area, providing data reference for the sample drilling.
After the sampling was completed, a Chinese national flag carried by the lander was unfurled for the first time on the far side of the moon.
Unlike takeoff on Earth, the ascender could not rely on a launch tower system. The lander acted as a temporary ""launching pad.""
The Chang'e-6 ascender's takeoff from the far side of the moon cannot copy the Chang'e-5 ascent from the near side of the moon, as it cannot directly receive ground control and support. It utilized its special sensors to achieve autonomous positioning and orientation, with the assistance of Queqiao-2 for communication.
Compared with Chang'e-5, Chang'e-6 has seen improvements in the autonomy and reliability of its navigation, guidance and control system, in order to tackle the challenges posed by the uncertainties of the moon's far side during its takeoff and ascent, said Qiao Dezhi, a space expert from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).
The control system of Chang'e-6 has also been enhanced to improve its autonomy, enabling it to complete lunar takeoff and ascent with reduced reliance on the Queqiao-2 relay satellite and ground support, said Huang Hao, another space expert from the CASC.

Chinese, Swiss scientists design energy-efficient brain-like chip
 (Xinhua) 14:43, June 03, 2024
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese and Swiss scientists has jointly developed an energy-efficient sensing-computing neuromorphic chip that mimics the neurons and synapses of the human brain.
The human brain, capable of processing incredibly intricate and expansive neural networks, operates with a total power consumption of merely 20 watts, significantly lower than that of current AI systems. Therefore, neuromorphic or brain-like computing offers promising energy-saving machine intelligence.
The researchers from the Institute of Automation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and SynSense AG Corporation in Switzerland crafted this asynchronous chip, dubbed ""Speck,"" which boasts an impressively low resting power consumption of just 0.42 milliwatts, meaning it consumes almost no energy when there is no input.
Emulating the ""dynamic imbalance"" characteristic of the brain's spiking neural networks, the team of scientists has devised an attention-based framework in which significant external stimuli often garner more attention from the brain.
The framework is adept at meeting the algorithmic demands of dynamic computing, achieving a real-time power as low as 0.70 milliwatts, according to the study published recently in the journal Nature Communications.
This work offers artificial intelligence applications a brain-inspired intelligent solution characterized by exceptional energy efficiency, minimal latency and reduced power consumption, said Li Guoqi, one of the corresponding authors of the study.

China's Chang'e 6 robotic mission reached a crucial moment in the nation's historic lunar odyssey on Sunday morning when its landing craft successfully touched down on the moon's little-known far side.
With assistance from the Queqiao 2 relay satellite, the Chang'e 6 landing craft softly settled on the lunar surface at 6:23 am at a designated site inside the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the moon's largest, oldest and deepest basin.
The landing marked the arrival of China's, and the world's, second-ever spacecraft on the moon's far side, which scientists believe holds clues to many mysteries surrounding the moon as well as the solar system.
In the next two days, the craft is set to use a robotic arm and a drill to collect surface and underground substances and place them in a container that will be sealed before the materials are sent into lunar orbit for the journey to Earth.
If the mission goes according to plan, it will be the first time that dust and rocks from the lunar far side have been retrieved. The new samples will probably offer researchers around the globe useful keys for answering questions about the moon, and will likely bring a range of invaluable scientific payoffs.
According to the China National Space Administration, Chang'e 6's complex landing operation began on Thursday, when the landing craft separated from the combined orbiter and reentry capsule in preparation for the landing.
When everything was ready on Sunday morning, the landing craft began its descent at 6:09 am.
The craft continued making adjustments during the descent as its main engine worked to reduce the flying speed. Its special cameras took pictures of the selected destination and transmitted them to computers to determine the final landing point and also to identify possible hazards on the surface, such as large rocks, so that the craft could maneuver to avoid them.
When reaching an altitude of about 100 meters above the moon, the landing vessel suspended its descent and hovered for a short time to carry out accurate laser scanning of obstacles before continuing to descend at a slower and steady speed.
At the last moment of the challenging operation, when the craft was several meters above the surface, its main engine was stopped, and the craft activated a buffer system and touched down smoothly on the lunar surface. It thus became the second spacecraft to arrive on the lunar far side after Chang'e 4, which achieved the feat five-and-a-half years ago.
Soon after the landing, the craft's solar panels and directional antennas unfolded and went through initial checks and setup, and then the collection devices began to gather samples.
Meanwhile, two European scientific apparatus carried by the Chang'e 6 landing craft — a radon-measuring instrument from France's national space agency and a dedicated negative ion instrument developed by the Swedish Institute of Space Physics with support from the European Space Agency — have begun to operate on the lunar surface, according to the Chinese space administration.
The Chang'e 6 spacecraft, representing the world's first attempt to bring samples from the far side of the moon back to Earth, was launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket on May 3 from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province. It entered lunar orbit on May 8.
Like all previous Chinese lunar probes, the 8.35-metric-ton Chang'e 6 spacecraft was designed and built by the Beijing-based China Academy of Space Technology, a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. It consists of four major components — an orbiter, a lander, an ascender, and a reentry capsule.
By analyzing the physical and chemical characteristics of the samples from the moon's far side, scientists will be able to deepen their understanding of the origins and evolution of the moon and the solar system, said Ge Ping, one of the senior space officials overseeing the nation's lunar programs.
He added that the Chang'e 6 probe will also help space mission planners gain more experience for follow-up explorations on the lunar far side.
The lunar far side is the hemisphere of the moon that permanently faces away from Earth due to tidal forces on the planet. As it is never visible from Earth, that region was once dubbed the ""dark side of the moon"", although it receives just as much sunlight as the near side.
The vast region had never been reached by any spacecraft until January 2019, when the Chang'e 4 probe landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The Chang'e 4 surveyed the site but did not collect and send back samples.
Before the latest mission, China had fulfilled a lunar sample-return mission — the Chang'e 5 in the winter of 2020, which landed on the moon's near side and gathered 1,731 grams of samples, the first lunar substances obtained since the Apollo era. It made China the third nation, after the United States and the former Soviet Union, to have collected lunar samples.
So far, Chang'e 5 lunar samples have enabled Chinese researchers to make a number of academic strides, including the discovery of the sixth new lunar mineral, named Changesite-(Y).
Changesite-(Y), which falls in the category of lunar merrillite, is the first lunar mineral discovered and identified by Chinese scientists.

Foreign scientists thank China for sharing lunar exploration opportunity
 (Xinhua) 08:44, June 03, 2024
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- After China's Chang'e-6 touched down on the far side of the moon Sunday morning to collect samples, foreign scientists participating in the mission expressed their excitement and thanks for taking their scientific instruments to the moon.
The Chang'e-6 mission carried four payloads developed through international cooperation, providing more opportunities for global scientists and merging human expertise in space exploration.
Scientific instruments from France, Italy and the European Space Agency (ESA)/Sweden are aboard the Chang'e-6 lander.
""Thank China so much for taking us to the moon,"" Sylvestre Maurice, a French astronomer from the University of Toulouse, said after he watched the landing process in a control room at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Sunday.
""Today's landing is absolutely amazing. It's hard to land on a planet, and it's very hard especially on the moon. Don't think it's easy. Remember it's on the far side of the moon where we cannot see. And China had even to put another relay satellite to watch the landing. They landed right where they wanted to. So it's quite an achievement, something we've been looking for so many years,"" said Maurice.
Supported by the Queqiao-2 relay satellite, the lander-ascender combination of the Chang'e-6 probe successfully landed at the designated landing area at 6:23 a.m. (Beijing Time) in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin, according to the China National Space Administration.
""The far side of the moon is very unique. The South Pole-Aitken Basin is a huge basin. There was an impact long time ago to remove most of the crust, so we might have landed as close as possible to the mantle of the moon,"" Maurice said.
""As planetary scientists, the best thing we can dream of is to have samples in our lab. Nothing is better than having samples here, where we can study them and really go into the details of the story of the moon,"" said Maurice.
He mentioned that French scientists have got the lunar sample returned by the Chang'e-5 mission and would carry out research on it.
""We were very lucky to collaborate with China on different projects including the Chang'e lunar program and the Tianwen-1 Mars mission,"" he added.
Mathieu Grialou, a representative from the French space agency CNES, said Chang'e-6 will be the first mission to bring back samples from the far side of the moon. ""We are very thrilled to be a small part of this very big mission.""
""We are very happy to cooperate with China on this mission as China is now a big player in space,"" Grialou said. ""It's great that we can contribute together to a better knowledge of the moon and our solar system.""
A scientific instrument named Detection of Outgassing RadoN (DORN), developed by French scientists and onboard the lander of Chang'e-6, will detect radon isotopes and study the transmission and diffusion mechanisms of volatile compounds in the lunar environment.
Witnessing the landing of Chang'e-6, Pierre-Yves Meslin, principal investigator of DORN from France, said, ""We have been thinking about this moment for years and even more intensely for the last few months and weeks and days. We were almost watching at the moon every night here in Beijing.""
""We are very glad to be on the surface of the moon. Our instrument will start working. Now the pressure will be on us to succeed in our measurements,"" Meslin said.
He said the objective of the instrument is to study the origin and dynamics of the lunar exosphere. It will try to measure a radioactive gas called radon that is produced by lunar rocks in the lunar interior. ""This gas might migrate from the warm regions of the moon to the cold regions of the moon, and we will try to understand its dynamics in the lunar environment. It will be the first time to measure it on the surface of the moon.""
He mentioned that his team had a short time to develop the instrument, with only 3.5 years. ""The schedule was very tight but we succeeded with the help of our Chinese partners.""
""It's always good to share ideas with the different countries, which allows us to move forward to enrich our knowledge. As Europeans, we don't have the capacity to deploy our instruments on the surface of the moon yet. So we rely on international partners. China is now one of the most reliable partners that can safely land on the moon, as we have one more proof today,"" said Meslin.
Patrick Pinet, a scientist at the University of Toulouse, said Chang'e-6's landing seems smooth and easy, but it relies on a very heavy job and high skills. ""And we're very impressed by what was achieved by China this time again.""
""It's a very moving time for me,"" he said, noting that when he was 10 years old, he watched Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon on TV, and today it is his first experience of witnessing a landing on the far side of the moon in a control room in China. ""It's 55 years later, and a lot of things have evolved through time.""
""We really expect to have some success with this mission and with the next ones to come,"" he added.
The lander of the Chang'e-6 spacecraft also carried an instrument, called Negative Ions on the Lunar Surface (NILS), developed by the ESA/Sweden to the moon, which will be used to detect negative ions and study the interaction between plasma and the lunar surface.
Neil Melville-Kenney, NILS technical officer of the ESA, said the CNSA's initiative to invite international partners to participate in the Chang'e-6 mission is very much appreciated by the international community.
""It's a very impressive mission, a very ambitious mission. So we are very pleased to be a part of it. And the collaboration has gone very smoothly. Now we are waiting for the payload to be turned on so that we can get our first data,"" he said.
""It's very important to have international cooperation for space exploration. I think space exploration encourages us to consider our planet as one and our people as one. And it's important that we work together as we start to explore the solar system more and more. Together we can achieve greater things,"" he added.

China's Chang'e-6 lands on moon's far side to collect samples
 (Xinhua) 08:18, June 03, 2024
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Chang'e-6 touched down on the far side of the moon on Sunday morning, and will collect samples from this rarely explored terrain for the first time in human history, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced.
Supported by the Queqiao-2 relay satellite, the lander-ascender combination of the Chang'e-6 probe successfully landed at the designated landing area at 6:23 a.m. (Beijing Time) in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin.
Chang'e-6 consists of an orbiter, a returner, a lander and an ascender. Since its launch on May 3 this year, it has gone through various stages such as Earth-moon transfer, near-moon braking, lunar orbiting and landing descent. The lander-ascender combination separated from the orbiter-returner combination on May 30, said the CNSA.

The lander-ascender combination began the powered descent at 6:09 a.m. The main engine with variable thrust was ignited, and the combination quickly adjusted its attitude and gradually approached the lunar surface.
During the descent, an autonomous visual obstacle avoidance system was used to automatically detect obstacles, with a visible light camera selecting a comparatively safe landing area based on the brightness and darkness of the lunar surface.
The combination then hovered about 100 meters above the safe landing area and used a laser 3D scanner to detect obstacles on the lunar surface to select the final landing site before a slow vertical descent. As the combination approached the lunar surface, it shut down the engine and touched down via free fall, protected by a cushioning system.
The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's far side, the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.
It has achieved a breakthrough in the design and control technology of the lunar retrograde orbit and aims to realize key technologies of intelligent and rapid sampling, as well as takeoff and ascent from the far side of the moon.
PRECISE LANDING
According to Li Chunlai, deputy chief designer of the Chang'e-6 mission, the probe landed precisely at the designated area. This area is likely to be covered with a lot of basalt, which is very beneficial for geological research and can deliver significant scientific value.

The landing site is at an impact crater known as the Apollo Basin, located within the SPA Basin. The choice was made for the Apollo Basin's potential value of scientific exploration, as well as the conditions of the landing area, including communication and telemetry conditions and the flatness of the terrain, said Huang Hao, a space expert from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).
The colossal SPA Basin was formed by a celestial collision over 4 billion years ago and has a diameter of 2,500 kilometers, equivalent to the distance from Beijing to Hainan, and a depth of about 13 kilometers. It is the oldest and largest impact crater on the moon and in the solar system, and it may provide the earliest information available about the moon, according to scientists.
The huge impact of the celestial collision that formed the SPA Basin may have ejected materials from the depths of the moon. If such materials can be collected and returned to Earth for study, they would provide new insights into both the early impact history of the solar system and the geological evolution of the moon.
Huang added that the terrain on the far side of the moon is more rugged than the near side, with fewer continuous flat areas. However, the Apollo Basin is relatively flatter than other areas on the far side, which is conducive to landing.
The lander is equipped with multiple sensors, including microwave, laser and optical imaging sensors which can measure distance and speed, and identify obstacles on the lunar surface, Huang said.
To prevent interference to optical sensors by lunar dust during landing, the lander is also equipped with gamma-ray sensors to accurately measure the height through particle rays, ensuring that the engine can be shut down on time and the lander can touch down smoothly on the lunar surface, he added.
At the same time, the landing legs play their role as buffers, absorbing the impact energy of landing and ensuring the safety of the equipment on the lander.
AUTONOMOUS SAMPLING
Ge Ping, spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission, said he is very excited about the successful landing, but that this is not the time to relax, as the key task of the mission, sampling on the far side of the moon, is about to begin.
After the landing, the probe is scheduled to complete sampling within two days. It has adopted two methods of moon sampling, which include using a drill to collect subsurface samples and grabbing samples on the surface with a robotic arm.

According to Jin Shengyi, another space expert from the CASC, the Chang'e-6 probe development team has built a simulation lab in advance to ensure a smooth sampling process.
The team members will set up a full-scale replica of the sampling area based on Chang'e-6 exploration results on the environment, rock distribution, and lunar soil conditions around the landing site. Using this simulation, they will develop and verify sampling strategies and equipment control procedures to ensure the accuracy of instructions.
Due to the moon's obstruction, the Earth-moon communication window period on the far side of the moon, even with the help of the Queqiao-2 relay satellite service, is still shorter than that on the near side. Therefore, the sampling time of Chang'e-6 will be reduced to about 14 hours, compared with the 22 hours used by its predecessor Chang'e-5.
To save time and improve efficiency, the development team has made the sampling process more intelligent, allowing Chang'e-6 to execute instructions and make judgments autonomously to reduce the Earth-moon interactions, Jin said.
For example, after the ground control sends an instruction, the probe will execute the corresponding program in multiple actions and then use the real-time data collected by the sensors to evaluate if the instruction is well executed, thus autonomously working in a closed loop without the ground control sending command on each action.
About 1,000 instructions were sent during the entire sampling process of Chang'e-5. For Chang'e-6, the number is expected to be reduced to about 400.

Ge Ping, also deputy director of the CNSA's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center, believes that through detailed analysis of the soil structure, physical properties and material composition of the Chang'e-6 samples, scientists will be able to deepen research on the genesis and evolutionary history of the moon, the origin of the solar system and so on, laying an improved foundation for later exploration missions to build on.
INT'L COOPERATION
Chang'e-6 is in good shape, and its three international payloads are in normal condition and will boot up and start operation, Ge said.
The three payloads Ge mentioned are installed on the lander, and consist of the lunar surface negative ion analyzer of the European Space Agency (ESA), France's lunar radon detector and Italy's laser retro-reflector.
The Chang'e-6 mission also carried a cube satellite from Pakistan that was aboard the orbiter. It separated from the orbiter on May 8 to carry out exploration activities, such as capturing images of the moon. China delivered data provided by the cube satellite to Pakistan on May 10.

Chinese scientists will share scientific data generated by the mission with their international partners and carry out joint research, Ge said, noting that access to the Chang'e-6 samples will open for international applications at a later stage.
When watching the landing process at the National Astronomical Observatories, which fall under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pierre-Yves Meslin, principal investigator of France's lunar radon detector program, said he and his colleagues have been thinking about this moment for years.
""We were looking at the moon almost every night here in Beijing,"" he revealed, while adding that it is a very good idea to have international collaboration because scientific study requires a large community of scientists.
""It's a very impressive and ambitious mission. We are very pleased to be a part of it. The collaboration has gone very smoothly,"" said Neil Melville-Kenney, technical officer of the ESA's Negative Ions on the Lunar Surface project.
""I think space exploration encourages us to consider our planet as one and our people as one,"" he added.

Chinese scientists achieve speed breeding of rice in desert,2024-05-31,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0531/c90000-20176635.html,"Home>>

BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Amid the sprawling desert in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Chinese scientists are harnessing advanced greenhouse technologies to unleash the agricultural potential of the otherwise infertile land.
Within the greenhouses that stretch ten thousand acres in Hotan, southern Xinjiang, scientists from the Institute of Urban Agriculture (IUA) of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences have recently harvested the first batch of rice grown in the desert.
""The rice is cultivated on three-layer frames along with precise environment control in desert greenhouses, rather than conventional methods, which nearly halves the growth cycle, harvesting in just two months,"" said Yang Qichang, the chief scientist of IUA.
According to Yang, this achievement was built upon the earlier successes in the plant factory in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province, where his team halved the growth period for the first time through speed breeding technology in 2021.
In Yang's view, the harsh climate in the Hotan desert provides an opportunity rather than a hindrance. This region's unique geographical features, including long hours of sunshine and a large difference in temperature between day and night, provide an ideal condition for crop cultivation.
Researchers have also accelerated plant growth by applying dynamic LED lighting recipes, specific nutrient solution formulations, and advanced soilless cultivation technologies.
""By utilizing advantages of the desert climate, such as abundant light and heat resources, the potential for protected agriculture becomes increasingly promising, paving the way for sustainable food production in Xinjiang,"" said Shi Dawei, an assistant researcher at IUA.
According to Yang, by using energy-efficient technologies in Hotan desert greenhouses, running costs were significantly reduced compared to conventional greenhouses.
""Currently, the construction cost of energy-saving desert greenhouses is 350 yuan (about 48.2 U.S. dollars) per square meter, around one-third of that of Dutch glasshouses. Meanwhile, its operation cost is about 25 percent of Dutch glasshouses,"" Yang said, adding that glasshouses in the Netherlands are recognized as one of the top examples of facility-based agriculture.
""In the future, both construction and operation costs of this kind of greenhouse can be reduced by the use of green energy, mechanization, and artificial intelligence. Such greenhouses will be highly competitive internationally,"" he added.
Yang said this breakthrough in the speed breeding technology of desert greenhouse crops provides technical support for using desert greenhouses to carry out annual crop production and speed breeding in Xinjiang in the future.
Yang and his research team have also explored key technologies for speed breeding of staple crops such as soybean, maize and wheat, as well as oilseed rape, cotton and alfalfa in the desert greenhouse in Hotan.
