KIGALI, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- Professor Lin Zhanxi from China's Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, who invented Juncao Technology, has returned to Rwanda to motivate the technology users, years after it was introduced in the east African country.
Speaking in a recent interview at Kabuye in the Gasabo District of Kigali, the Rwandan capital, his former workstation, Lin, 81, recalled how they had to overcome a variety of challenges including fear, lack of water, electricity, poor housing and malaria infection to establish Juncao Technology in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide against Tutsi in Rwanda.
He said that during his first visit to Rwanda, government officials in the Ministry of Agriculture informed him about unemployment, food insecurity, hunger and poverty in the country, the major challenges the government faced.
From 2006 to the first half of 2011, he said Chinese technicians visited Rwanda to support the project and wondered how they would withstand a lack of water, let alone electricity.
""But we had a firm belief that we could help the locals here get out of poverty, so we persevered,"" he said, stressing that the success of Juncao in Rwanda was about firm belief and persistence.
Juncao, a hybrid grass and an important multifunctional agricultural resource, was developed in China and is used for mushroom farming.
""It is precisely because of our persistence that a new way has been forged for the low-income poor rural households in Rwanda, which is to increase job opportunities, eradicate poverty, and uplift millions of poor women in rural households,"" he said.
Lin believes that Juncao technology has taken root in Rwandan villages and households, where experts work closely with the people.
To date, over 4,000 Rwandan farmers are benefiting from Juncao technology. More than 30,000 people in the agricultural value chain are employed in the sector, according to information from the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board.
""We are here to help people... The participation and development of poor households will play a positive role in the survival and development of mankind,"" said Lin.
He advised Rwandans to take advantage of the rains the country receives to plant Giant Juncao and urged them to make full use of the grass to grow mushrooms, so the income can be greatly increased.
Alphonse Munyaneza, a Rwandan university student growing mushrooms, said that Lin's dedication and encouragement energize mushroom growers in the country. Munyaneza could not hide his excitement of meeting the person behind Juncao technology. ""Today is a great day for me because I didn't expect this visit. I usually come to work on weekends, spend a few hours on the business, and then return to school,"" he said.
Munyaneza started mushroom growing after receiving training from early learners of Juncao Technology in his Gasabo District.
""After finishing my secondary studies, I approached an expert to teach me how to produce mushrooms. He agreed, and I undertook two months of training. With a small investment of around 100,000 Rwandan francs, I was able to make a profit in just three months,"" he said. ""He has promised to teach me how to produce mushroom tubes. At home, we consume mushrooms regularly. There was a time when prices were high because of scarcity and that's when I decided to grow them myself, initially for consumption, but later I realized its business potential.""
The proceeds from mushrooms help Munyaneza cover his transport costs to school as well as family needs.
""In this world, relying solely on a wage or salary is difficult. Having a side business is crucial. I hope to continue growing this business, and perhaps one day, I'll pursue further studies in China, inspired by my mentor's success,"" Munyaneza said.

As China's national diving team continues its gold rush at the Paris Olympic Games, its artificial intelligence training system is making a big splash in the field of sports innovations.
Developed by Chinese tech giant Baidu, the training system has ""sharp eyes and a strong brain"", said Lu Feixiang, a senior engineer at the company's research institute.
The system captures intricate details of diving movements that traditional video systems cannot, provides immediate feedback and real-time analysis, and allows performances to be compared in detail with the previous best one.
The technology is just one example of how AI is permeating the Paris 2024 Games, referred to by some as the ""first AI Olympics"" due to the extensive use of AI in training, refereeing, broadcasting and even anti-doping measures.
""Diving involves executing complex movements within a brief 1.8-second window, from the jump to entering the water,"" Lu said. ""Perfecting every detail is crucial for Chinese athletes' famed splashless dives.""
Traditional video recording falls short in capturing rapid sequences, and the subsequent data analysis is time-consuming and less immediate.
Based on Baidu's ChatGPT-like product and large language model Ernie Bot, the AI system addresses these challenges by offering clear, accurate, comprehensive insights, advancing data quantification and analyzing the dives, Lu said.
""The AI system allows for timely playback and scoring. I use it to refine my technique,"" Quan Hongchan, who won the women's synchronized 10-meter platform diving event with her teammate Chen Yuxi, said before the competition.
Chen said, ""AI can break down movement details, helping me master the nuances of timing and entry control.""

Transformative event
AI and technology innovations are transforming the Paris Olympics with applications ranging from training athletes to enhanced broadcast experiences to efficient energy management.
The International Olympic Committee recognized the transformative potential of AI in the ""Olympic AI Agenda"" report published in April. The IOC said it aims to adopt a ""holistic approach to explore the great potential of AI, while mitigating the risks"".
The agenda sets out a list of AI goals that focus on optimizing the Games, detecting talent, and reducing human bias. Many of these applications are being tested for the first time in Paris.
Thomas Bach, the IOC president, emphasized the importance of using AI to safeguard athletes from cyber abuse, with around half a billion social media posts anticipated during the Paris Games. In addition, AI is being used to create highlight videos in multiple formats and languages, he said in a statement.
""We are also using AI to make the Olympic Games more sustainable, through a very sophisticated first-ever data capture and energy management system. AI is also opening up new ways for talent identification, and this project will be launched by us globally in 2025 to live up to the commitment we made that AI in sport must be accessible to everybody,"" Bach added.
The market for use of AI in sport is projected to grow from $6 billion in 2024 to $21 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate of 28.69 percent, according to market research company Mordor Intelligence.

The growth potential is reflected in Paris, where Chinese tech companies are leveraging their cutting-edge cloud computing and AI tools to enhance live broadcast experiences and athletes' performances.
""For Chinese companies with global strategies, having a marked presence at the Olympics can be a vital accelerator to boost brand influence and international development,"" said Jiang Han, a senior researcher at the Beijing-based think tank, the Pangoal Institution.
""This is a once-in-a-four-year opportunity for Chinese companies to showcase their latest innovations to the global audience, and mirror their technological prowess,"" Jiang added.
Chinese tech giant Alibaba Cloud, for instance, is replacing traditional satellite methods by using its advanced technologies to support over two-thirds of the event's broadcasts. These technologies are improving internal workflows, enhancing the viewer experience, enriching storytelling, and helping better explain some sports.
Alibaba Cloud has provided a record number of multi-camera replay systems with AI-powered, high-quality reconstruction in the cloud, to create three-dimensional models and mapping of additional viewpoints of 21 sports and disciplines. This helps deliver more compelling replays from more camera angles.
The ""bullet time"" multi-camera replay system, an AI-enhanced broadcasting technology developed by Alibaba Cloud, provides viewers with cinematic effects, including slow-motion and freeze-frame views, offering an immersive experience. This technology is deployed at 12 venues, covers sports including beach volleyball, tennis, judo, and rugby — and delivers high-quality replays from multiple angles.
Yiannis Exarchos, CEO of the IOC's subsidiary Olympic Broadcasting Services, oversees the distribution of event coverage. To improve efficiency for broadcasters, Alibaba Cloud launched OBS Cloud in conjunction with OBS in September 2018, and supported the broadcast coverage of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, he said.
For media rights holders and host cities, OBS Cloud is a more cost-effective alternative as Olympic Games-related content can be transmitted over the cloud, which also helps reduce an event's carbon footprint, Exarchos added.
 
Basketball applications
Chinese AI pioneer SenseTime is supporting the Chinese basketball teams competing at the Olympics by providing AI-driven sports data analysis and advice on game strategies.
The company's AI technology is being used to analyze data such as Chinese players' movements, a basketball's trajectory, and training efficiency.
SenseTime became the AI strategic partner of the Chinese national basketball team earlier this year, and has developed a basketball performance analysis platform in cooperation with the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Shanghai University of Sport.
The platform applies AI technology to data statistics and match videos, providing decision-making support for training and game strategies.
It can analyze each athlete's movement and the trajectory of the basketball in real time, and give immediate feedback to the coaches by constructing 3D models and leveraging 3D motion capture algorithms. The goal of the platform is to improve athletes' training efficiency and their competition performance, SenseTime added.
Yao Ming, chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, said, ""We look forward to continuously exploring the application of AI large language models in the sports field with SenseTime, jointly promoting the development of Chinese basketball and the sports industry.""
The company's smart broadcasting technology is also being used to cover table tennis and archery events, providing viewers with an immersive viewing experience.
Lin Yiting, director of marketing and solutions at SenseTime's international research and development center, said the company's InnoMotion broadcasting solution uses 3D motion capture technology without the need for wearable devices. InnoMotion was created in collaboration with Shanghai Media Tech, a media technology company.
The technology covers large-scale, multiangle scenes and captures spatial motion data in real time. In complex sports scenarios it can accurately capture and analyze fastmoving small targets such as table tennis balls and arrows, Lin said.
The rotation and trajectory of table tennis balls can be shown to viewers through augmented reality technologies, allowing them to better understand the intricacies of such Olympic sports, Lin added.

"Digital aquaponics factory ensures intelligent fish farming, vegetable growing in SW China’s Chongqing",2024-08-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0806/c90000-20202633.html,"Home>>
		
Digital aquaponics factory ensures intelligent fish farming, vegetable growing in SW China’s Chongqing
 (People's Daily Online) 14:37, August 06, 2024
At a digital aquaponics factory that combines fish farming and vegetable growing in Liangping district, southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, there's no one to be seen.
An automated feeding system precisely feeds the perches, while Li Mai remotely monitors and controls the system from an office in downtown Chongqing, with production data automatically transmitted to his computer.
""I'm an engineer and a new type of fisherman,"" said Li, an agricultural digital technician at the Chongqing Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Unlike traditional feeding methods based on experience with fish, the system enables AI-driven intelligent feeding. Li's role now focuses on ""feeding"" data to the AI farming system to make it smarter and more experienced.
The factory has an aquaponics system where fish are raised downstairs and vegetables are grown upstairs, with pipes connecting the two floors. The fish pools use smart algorithms to control feeders based on the fish’s needs, while sensors automatically monitor water conditions, including temperature and dissolved oxygen levels. In the vegetable greenhouses, wastewater from fish farming is turned into liquid fertilizer for vegetables after treatment.
Precise monitoring is key to the success of the fish farming model, and that means the sensors it relies on to monitor water quality must be accurate.
The journey hasn't been without difficulties. In 2022, the farm suffered significant fish losses due to sensor failures. Poor predictions by the sensors resulted in water quality adjustments not being made in time.
The Chongqing Academy of Agricultural Sciences brought in aquaculture experts to solve the problems, ensuring more accurate water quality management.
Under the guidance of experts and professors, a much stronger water quality system was developed that used monitoring sensors and predictive AI models to create a smart early warning system for any issues.
Next, Li and his colleagues focused on feeding the fish. Insufficient feeding of the fish slows down their growth, while over feeding wastes resources and can also cause issues for the fish.
Together, they eventually developed an AI model for precise feeding and an intelligent feeder, significantly reducing farming costs. They have also developed a system to monitor the growth of fish.
Li said that the digital aquaponics factory has nearly halved the growth cycle of fish, reduced feed use by 20 percent, and increased the per unit output of fish tenfold compared to that in ponds. In addition, the vegetable yield there is also over ten times that of farmland.

Chinese researchers quantify global carbon emissions from biomass burning,2024-08-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0806/c90000-20202602.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers quantify global carbon emissions from biomass burning
 (Xinhua) 13:34, August 06, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has employed the country's Fengyun-3D satellite's global fire spot monitoring data to quantify global carbon emissions from open biomass burning (OBB) and develop a global high-resolution daily OBB emission inventory.
The study, conducted by researchers from the Aerospace Information Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published in the journal Earth System Science Data.
OBB--characterized by its periodic nature, randomness, multiple sources, broad impact, and challenges in monitoring--is a major source of global carbon emissions, including forest fires, grassland fires, shrub fires, and crop residue burning.
Accurately quantifying carbon emissions from OBB is crucial for understanding terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycles and is essential for determining carbon budget balances on both global and regional scales.
Additionally, carbon emissions from OBB are a key input for atmospheric chemical transport models. Accurate and reliable emission inventories improve the precision of these models.
Hence, scientifically and effectively calculating OBB carbon emissions is essential for understanding both terrestrial carbon cycles and atmospheric carbon concentrations.
This study quantified the estimated global average annual OBB carbon emissions from different regions and fire types during 2020 and 2022. Southern Africa was found to be the primary source of global OBB carbon emissions totaling 850 million tonnes annually. It was followed by southern South America, northern Africa and Southeast Asia, whose emissions hit 530 million, 390 million and 200 million tonnes per year, respectively.
The contributions of each fire type to the global OBB carbon emissions were also quantified. Savanna grasslands fires were found to be the leading source, contributing an average of 1.21 billion tonnes of carbon per year, which accounted for 46.7 percent of the global total. It was followed by shrub fires and tropical forest fires, which represented 33 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively.
This detailed breakdown not only highlights the specific impact of different types of fires on carbon emissions but also emphasizes the need for targeted control measures for each fire type.
""The study presents new methods for precisely quantifying how global OBB emissions affect atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,"" said Shi Yusheng, corresponding author of the study.
Shi added that the study also provides crucial scientific evidence for managing OBB and offers essential guidance for implementing environmental policies focused on ecological management and coordinated carbon reduction.

AI-enhanced cybersecurity gathers pace
By Ma Si (China Daily) 08:31, August 06, 2024

Products related to cybersecurity are on display during an expo in Shanghai. CHINA DAILY
The increasing integration of artificial intelligence into various sectors has significantly influenced the domain of cybersecurity, and as digital threats become more sophisticated, the traditional approaches to cybersecurity are proving inadequate, thereby necessitating the adoption of AI-enhanced solutions, officials and experts said.
The comments came after the cybersecurity industry in China saw substantial growth, with its market size reaching about 220 billion yuan ($30.8 billion) in 2023 and the number of listed companies in the sector increasing to 28, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
Sui Jing, director of the cybersecurity administration of the MIIT, said the integration of AI with security measures will spur the development of new technologies, products and models within the cybersecurity space.
This synergy is expected to lead to the intensive development of high-end and intelligent security products, ultimately enhancing the capability to safeguard against cyber threats, Sui said. The ministry, she said, will increase efforts to encourage companies to develop crucial technologies for AI-enhanced security, especially in areas such as industrial internet and autonomous driving.
Wu Hequan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, highlighted the importance of collaborative efforts between AI providers and industries to develop industry-specific AI large language models or LLMs.
LLMs are AI models fed with huge amounts of text data for use in a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to machine translation. It is the key technology underpinning OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm since late 2022.
Such collaborations can widen access to advanced AI capabilities, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, enabling them to effectively implement AI-driven security measures, Wu said.
The integration of AI into cybersecurity is not just a technological advancement but a necessity in the face of evolving cyber threats. As AI continues to redefine content production and consumption, its role in cybersecurity becomes increasingly critical, Wu said.
Zhou Hongyi, founder and chairman of 360 Security Group, emphasized the critical role of AI in addressing the limitations of traditional cybersecurity methods.
AI's superior data processing capabilities and its ability to quickly respond to incidents and trace security breaches are pivotal in managing the vast amounts of data involved in cybersecurity operations, Zhou said.
He underscored the need for AI-driven solutions to stay ahead of malicious actors who are increasingly leveraging AI to develop sophisticated attack tools.
AI-assisted crimes have been rising. For instance, in February, Hong Kong police revealed a fraud case where individuals used AI deepfake technology. The perpetrators impersonated a multinational company's chief financial officer during a video conference, convincing a Hong Kong-based employee to transfer HK$200 million ($30.9 million).The fraud was only uncovered when the employee verified the request with the headquarters.
This incident highlights the dual-edged nature of AI in cybersecurity. While AI can greatly enhance defense mechanisms, it also equips adversaries with powerful tools to execute more convincing and sophisticated attacks. This dichotomy necessitates a robust AI-centric approach to cybersecurity that can both counteract AI-enhanced threats and leverage AI's capabilities to strengthen defenses, experts said.
In response to these challenges, companies like 360 Security Group are heavily investing in the development of AI-driven cybersecurity models. Zhou said the 360 Security Model includes six specialized submodels focusing on various aspects of cybersecurity, such as attack detection, operational management, traceability, knowledge management, data protection, code security and vulnerability analysis.
This comprehensive approach ensures that different facets of cybersecurity are addressed using tailored AI solutions, Zhou said.
Moreover, to make these advanced security models accessible, 360 Security Group has announced that its security model will be available for free to customers purchasing its standard products, with existing customers receiving free upgrades.

Chinese academic researchers and telecom operators are leaving no stone unturned in efforts to establish a beachhead for 6G, the next-generation wireless technology that has already turned into a key battleground for innovation and industrial transformation.
Despite growing geopolitical interference in the global telecom industry, China has a solid foundation in telecom talent and patents, and its edge in 5G will help the country gain an upper hand in the race toward 6G research and development, experts and company executives said.
The comments came as the world enters a crucial window of opportunity to identify technologies and formulate key standards for 6G. While there is still no universally accepted definition of the technology, 6G is expected to have far lower latency, higher speeds and more bandwidth than 5G.
More importantly, the technology will be able to support the integration of space, air, territorial and maritime communication technologies, which will spawn a wide range of innovative applications, they added.
China is aiming to commercialize the technology around 2030. ""We will kick off a string of scientific projects targeting 6G and aim to achieve breakthroughs in crucial technologies,"" said Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology.

Progress underway
In July, a group of Chinese telecom engineers announced they had established the world's first field test network that integrates communications and intelligence.
The experimental network has achieved remarkable improvements in key communication metrics, including capacity, coverage and efficiency, according to Zhang Ping, a Chinese Academy of Engineering academician and a professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
The network serves as a platform for research institutions conducting theoretical research and initial verification of 6G pivotal technologies, and effectively lowers the entry threshold for 6G research, making it more accessible for innovation, according to the team of engineers.
""The European Union, the United States, Japan, South Korea and other countries and regions have all initiated research on 6G, and China has unique strengths,"" said Wen Ku, director-general of the China Communications Standards Association.
China has made remarkable strides in 5G infrastructure, which gives it an unparalleled edge in exploring 6G technologies, he said.
By the end of May, China had built over 3.8 million 5G base stations, accounting for 60 percent of the global total. These advances have helped position China as a global leader in 5G technology, with over 60 percent of mobile communication users in the country now utilizing 5G services, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
Meanwhile, China has handled over 94,000 5G applications in industries such as manufacturing, mining, power, ports and healthcare, the ministry added.
""Advancing the use of 5G is like building a good bridge and road for 6G, and efforts to promote the large-scale application of 5G will lay a solid foundation for 6G development, which is still in the early stage,"" Wen said.
More importantly, the country already has an early edge in 6G patent applications over the US and Japan.
China's 6G patent applications accounted for 40.3 percent of the global total, and topped the list of global 6G patent filings, according to a survey conducted by Japanese media company Nikkei and Tokyo-based research company Cyber Creative Institute in 2021.
The US and Japan took second and third spots on the list with 35.2 and 9.9 percent respectively, followed by Europe with 8.9 percent, and South Korea with 4.2 percent, the report said.
In the telecom industry, countries with core advantages in previous-generation wireless technology are more likely to gain advantages in next-generation technology and achieve technological leadership and promote healthy industry development, China Galaxy Securities said in a research note.
Yang Guang, senior chief analyst at the global market research company Omdia, said: ""China believes that a mobile network is an important infrastructure that needs to be built ahead of schedule. Once the road is ready, cars will come naturally. The underlying condition is that Chinese operators are all State-owned enterprises and need to bear considerable social responsibility.""
European and US telecom operators are private enterprises, and their first consideration is financial performance. Their main objective is to reduce costs, which makes them less inclined to build infrastructure, Yang said.

Vitality, innovation
In sharp contrast to some countries' closed mindset in telecom development, China has highlighted that 6G requires consensus and close cooperation of all parties involved in the global industry, academia, research and applications. This will generate greater vitality and a more vibrant innovation atmosphere, experts said.
Zhang Yunming, vice-minister of industry and information technology, has repeatedly called for more efforts to deepen international cooperation to promote the formulation of unified 6G global standards.
Both Chinese and foreign telecom and smartphone companies have participated in China's 6G technical trials and tests, as 6G moves from a concept to a crucial stage of potential technological breakthroughs, said Wang Zhiqin, head of the IMT-2030 (6G) Promotion Group, a government-affiliated flagship platform for promoting 6G and international cooperation in the country.
Wang said Nokia Shanghai Bell, Ericsson, China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, Huawei, ZTE, Vivo and Inspur have participated in China's 6G technical trials and tests.
China's 6G development adheres to the principle of open cooperation, strengthens international exchanges, and has inked cooperation agreements with partners in South Korea, Europe and India, she said.
That is in contrast to what the US government has done. In February, a group of 10 countries, including the US and the United Kingdom, announced that they had endorsed a set of principles to underpin the development of secure and resilient 6G networks.
Dong Yifan, an assistant research fellow at the Institute of European Studies at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said this is an example of how US-led developed countries want to unite with their allies to have a bigger say in formulating 6G standards.
""They have lost their edge in 5G and (now) they want to regain their strength in 6G, which has turned into a key battleground for innovation and industrial transformation,"" Dong said.
""This is a typical US practice of forming a small group to contain China in the international telecom arena, which will, in fact, slow down the development of the entire global telecommunications technology, given China's unparalleled advantage in the telecom industry.""
The US government has already pressured a string of countries such as the UK into removing the telecom equipment of Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE from their 5G networks by fanning national security fears, which had never been substantiated, Dong added.
Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer of GSMA, an industry group representing the world's biggest mobile phone operators, said it will work hard to avoid the so-called ""small yard, high fence"" situation with 6G.
""If there are trends of isolation, it would have a negative impact on the industry and we would lose many advantages. Ultimately, the development of 6G technology standards should be a global collaborative effort involving academia, research institutions, and commercial sectors, including innovative technology companies,"" Sinclair said.

Ready for liftoff
Huang Yuhong, general manager of the China Mobile Research Institute, said that""6G is expected to be commercially available around 2030 in China, and 3GPP (an international organization for telecom technology development) is expected to start 6G standardization in 2025. As the day is drawing near, 6G R&D has now reached a key breakthrough period.""
China Mobile, the world's largest telecom carrier by mobile phone subscribers, successfully launched the world's first satellite to test 6G architecture in February, marking a milestone in its efforts to explore integrated space and ground communication technology.
The low-Earth orbit test satellite is the first to employ 6G design architecture, which was jointly developed by China Mobile and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Innovation Academy for Microsatellites.
The system, utilizing domestic software and hardware, supports in-orbit software reconstruction, flexible deployment of core network functions and automated management, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the in-orbit operation of the satellite core network, China Mobile said.
Orbiting at a height of approximately 500 kilometers, these satellites offer advantages such as low latency and high data transfer rates compared with high-orbit satellites. As a crucial platform for future integrated space and ground networks, low-earth orbit satellites can address telecom signal coverage gaps in terrestrial mobile networks, providing higher bandwidth satellite internet services globally, according to China Mobile.
China Mobile said it plans to conduct in-orbit experiments based on these test satellites, accelerating the integration and development of space-to-ground technology industries.
""In order to realize 6G commercialization by 2030, the base stations for forming 6G networks should be ready around 2029,"" Huang added. The global 6G market is predicted to reach $340 billion by 2040, with a compound annual growth rate of over 28 percent between 2031 and 2040, according to a report by the market analysis firm Market Research Future.
The Asia-Pacific region, especially China, where more attention to satellite communications and related technological improvements takes place, will lead the trend, the report said.
China Unicom, another major Chinese telecom, is also working hard to explore key potential technologies for 6G. The company expects to complete technical research and explore early application scenarios for 6G technology by 2025.
China Unicom said it will promote close collaboration between the industry, the academic community and research institutes to carry out collaborative innovation in 6G unified network architecture and technologies.
""In the past, Chinese companies worked with international organizations to establish standards for 3G, 4G and 5G technologies,"" said Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association. ""They should enhance their partnerships and cooperation with foreign counterparts to promote the formation of globally unified 6G standards.""

Crucial upgrade
As the commercial application of 6G is still years away, Chinese telecom companies are also working hard to develop the 5G-Advanced, or 5G-A technology, which is a crucial upgrade to the 5G network in functionality and coverage and paves the way for key 6G technologies. For instance, 5G-A features 10-gigabit peak downlink speeds to meet increasingly diverse service requirements.
Wang Tao, executive director of Huawei Technologies Co, said over 60 telecom operators and partners globally have announced the arrival of 5G-A this commercial year. Over 30 devices supporting 5G-A are set to launch this year, marking a significant milestone in the digital era.
Wang said that 5G-A is a path for the industry that protects existing investments, while creating new business opportunities. He called for continuous enhancement of 5G-A technology to sustain the health and vitality of the 5G industry and to realize the vision of 5G transforming society.
As 5G-A accelerates its commercial deployment, AI brings new opportunities for the telecommunications industry. Wang said that""2024 marks the convergence of the 5G-A commercial year and the AI-to-device year, heralding the mobile AI era where intelligent services become ubiquitous"".

China's Ministry of State Security warned those working with confidential information against using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to write confidential materials and chat groups to discuss classified content, saying that numerous cases of data leaks were caused by the use of online office programs in recent years.
In recent years, AI writing has flourished and gradually become the ""pen"" of many office workers. Some personnel handling classified information, in order to save time, illegally input classified materials and content into AI writing programs to generate articles, believing that they are only extracting fragments of documents and will not cause leaks, the ministry wrote in a post on WeChat on Sunday.
It warned that those people are unaware that AI programs automatically collect the information input by users for autonomous learning, and the related data can be easily stolen by foreign intelligence agencies, leading to the leakage of national secrets.
It also said that some institutions have set up ""work groups"" on WeChat for the convenience of communication to report and exchange work matters. However, some of those institutions have violated regulations by notifying and discussing confidential contents in these groups, adding that some had even posted content involving state secrets in the form of pictures, files, and etc. in the group chat.
The confidential information in these group chats is easily re-posted by group members and even publicly disclosed, and the scope of knowledge cannot be controlled. Foreign intelligence agencies can also obtain chat records of key work groups through network attacks, posing a great risk of leakage of confidential information, said the ministry.
The ministry also warned cloud storage software of leaking confidential documents and image recognition app leaked the original confidential documents. In order to prevent similar leakages, the ministry advised people involved in confidential matters not to handle classified information online while working remotely. It is strictly prohibited to process classified information through the internet, and it is forbidden to publish or disseminate classified information online while using office software.

Robotics technician: Emerging profession boosting efficiency of industries
By Hong Qiuting (People's Daily) 13:34, August 05, 2024
At a demonstration area of robot applications of Guangdong Cuifeng Robotics Technology Co., Ltd. in south China's Guangdong province, Zhuang Yongchun was standing in front of a row of spinning robotic arms. After he made a few taps on a teach pendant, these robotic arms moved accordingly. Zhuang carefully inspected whether the gripping and rotating actions of the robotic arms were accurate and smoothly transitioned.
""It's not easy to make robots screw in screws and fetch screws from a box using their mechanical arms smoothly,"" said Zhuang, who's a robotics technician. ""Our profession has emerged as a result of the rise of intelligent manufacturing.""

In simple terms, Zhuang's daily work involves the development and application of industrial robots. He is primarily responsible for providing industrial robots to companies with specific needs and designing robot production lines for factories undergoing industrial automation upgrades.
A factory that produces medical sheet metal parts hoped to upgrade its production line for automation. Upon learning the news, Zhuang visited the factory.
""First, we need to assess the condition of the press brake and determine if it is compatible with our equipment. We also need to evaluate the bending bed and molds to ensure they meet the production requirements,"" Zhuang added.
After noting down the key technical specifications, Zhuang returned to his office and discussed with colleagues, designing solutions, simulating movements, and conducting 3D design.
""After multiple rounds of discussions and approval of the plan, we signed an agreement, and once the customer places the purchase order, we would start with drawing, procurement, assembly, and conduct action, signal, and hardware testing,"" Zhuang said. He added that the automation upgrade of a production line, from design to installation of 10 robotic arms, for example, can be successfully put into production in 5-10 days.
""For the factory, using robots can save labor costs. Previously, it required two or more people for bending, but now only one bending robot is needed,"" Zhuang told People's Daily, adding that this significantly improves production efficiency.
In fact, bending technique is closely related to people's daily lives. Televisions, refrigerators, computer cases, vending machines, data center servers, and many other electrical products on the market rely on the technique.
Previously, during his visits to enterprises along the industrial chain, Zhuang discovered that many factories in Dongguan, Guangdong province were employing the bending technique. Before the development of bending robots, products had to be manually produced, which often resulted in deviations and the production of defective goods.

""Can we develop a robot to alleviate the burden on workers and improve efficiency?"" This question lingered in the mind of Zhuang and his team.
The challenge with bending robots lies in keeping sheet metal products securely attached to the robot's suction cups while the robot performs bending actions. ""At that time, no one in the world had tackled this challenge,"" Zhuang said.
Zhuang diligently studied various comprehensive technologies related to robots, such as machine programming, circuits, machine tools, and engineering design. He continuously updated his knowledge system and devoted himself to the research and development of robot projects.
""After a year of efforts, we finally developed a bending robot and introduced this technology to the sheet metal industry nationwide, promoting the industry's transition towards intelligent manufacturing,"" Zhuang said. So far, this robot has been employed by more than 60 companies from over 10 provinces and municipalities, according to him.
While working on projects, Zhuang has also focused on talent training. He said that over the years, he has trained hundreds of robotics technicians, who are now working in various manufacturing companies and operating various production line robots.
""As the industry continues to develop, technology is constantly advancing, and we must keep pace with the times and make continuous progress,"" Zhuang said. He hopes that while China works to make its industries intelligent, more people will take on the jobs of robotics technician and other emerging professions.

Chinese companies develop AI video generation technology
 (Xinhua) 14:28, August 03, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 2 (Xinhua) -- Several artificial intelligence (AI) video generation large models developed by Chinese tech companies have been made available to global users, providing Chinese equivalents of OpenAI's Sora.
The latest one, named Vidu, developed by Chinese AI company ShengShu Technology and Tsinghua University, became accessible worldwide on Tuesday, providing text-to-video and image-to-video generation functions.
This large AI model, unveiled in April at the 2024 Zhongguancun Forum in Beijing, now gives users access to creating a high-definition video of four seconds or eight seconds in 1080p resolution with a single click, said Tang Jiayu, co-founder and CEO of the company.
Tang said that such technology will revolutionize the content industry, including the film and television animation sectors.
""Over the next decade, the barriers to, as well as the costs of, film and television creation and production will be further reduced, with imagination and creativity better transformed into productive forces,"" he said.
It is not the first China-made AI video generator that has opened for global users. Last Friday, Beijing-based tech company Zhipu AI launched its large video generation model product, known as Ying.
This product enables video generation based on not only texts and images, but also video clips, said Zhang Peng, CEO of the tech company.
In June, the short video platform Kuaishou also launched a large video generation model called ""KLING,"" which is capable of creating realistic motion scenes and accurate physics simulations in text-to-video and image-to-video generation.
Globally, there are already several technology companies working on text-to-video and image-to-video generation models. In China, mainstream AI video generation products adopt a structure that combines a deep learning model with a diffusion model, relying heavily on algorithms, computing power and data, according to Tang and Zhang.
Zhang admitted that domestic AI video generation technology is still in its infancy and imperfect, with a series of issues, such as high-quality data and algorithms, to be resolved.
""The best way to accelerate the development of AI is to parallel the research and development and the application of the technology, rather than keeping the technology locked in the laboratory and developing it in isolation,"" he said.
To date, China has filed and launched more than 180 AI generative content models that can provide services to the public, with registered users exceeding 564 million, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, said at the 12th Internet Security and Artificial Intelligence Conference held on Wednesday in Beijing.
Huang Chengqing, vice president of the Internet Society of China, said with its groundbreaking progress in recent years, AI is transitioning from the innovative research and development stage to a stage of innovative application -- thereby empowering the real economy.
""It is accelerating from the forefront of science and technology to real productive forces, and is expected to drive the transformation of new production methods,"" said Huang.

WUHAN, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- Low-altitude tourism in China is embracing a new mode as the country's homegrown AS700 civil manned airship on Thursday successfully made its first demonstration flight.
On Thursday morning, the AS700 airship took off from Zhanghe Airport in Jingmen, central China's Hubei Province, to show its performance and capabilities in serving low-altitude tourism, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).
This demonstration flight lasted nearly two hours, simulating low-altitude tourism application scenarios via a planned route.
The airship flew over local parks, an island in the river and other popular scenic spots across the city and then safely returned. It flew at a cruising speed of 60 kilometers per hour and an altitude of 500 meters during the flight, said the AVIC.
In the low-altitude skies, passengers aboard the AS700 can enjoy aerial views through the large panoramic side windows. With its moderate speed and an ideal altitude for low-altitude sightseeing, the airship will provide tourists with an experience similar to ""floating on clouds"" during the stable and safe flight journey, the developer said.
Developed by AVIC Special Vehicle Research Institute, AS700 is a type of single-capsule manned airship, which has a maximum capacity carrying 10 people, including a pilot. It has a maximum take-off weight of 4,150 kg, a maximum flight range of 700 km, and a maximum endurance of 10 hours, according to the AVIC.
AS700 is a type of non-rigid near-equilibrium airship. It can conduct vertical take-off and landing in a narrow field, and it is more mobile and flexible than other types of airships, said the AVIC.
The airship is capable of various applications, such as aerial tours, emergency rescue, urban security, and aerial geophysical surveys.
Last December, the AS700 obtained the type certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
China has a huge market and dense city clusters. The size of the country's low-altitude economy is estimated to have exceeded 500 billion yuan (70.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023, with its scale expected to rise to 2 trillion yuan by 2030, according to the CAAC.
The AVIC Special Vehicle Research Institute has already signed the delivery contract for the first AS700 airship, and signed multiple contracts of intent.
The AVIC disclosed that the institute is joining efforts with local governments to explore pilot applications of low-altitude scenarios of airships, and plans to build the country's first low-altitude airship tourism demonstration route.
The AVIC said AS700 manned airships could also be used in the fields of logistics and intelligent surveying and mapping.

China's optimized export control measures for unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, are expected to help domestic civilian drone manufacturers expand their presence in overseas markets, as well as bolster technological innovation and industrial upgrading in the sector, experts said on Thursday.
The adjustment will be conducive to the development of the whole drone industrial chain that covers raw materials supply, component manufacturing, and industry applications, while further improving the competitiveness of domestically developed drone products in the international market, they added.
Their comments came after the Ministry of Commerce announced on Wednesday that it had optimized and adjusted export controls on certain types of drones and some drone-related components.
China will remove temporary controls on certain consumer-grade drones, and prohibit the export of civilian drones, which are not included in the export control list, for use in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorist activities, or military purposes, the ministry said. The new measures will take effect starting on Sept 1.
The ministry has adjusted the control standards for some important components of drones, such as infrared imaging equipment and lasers for target indication. The move will better safeguard China's national security and interests, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains, a ministry spokesperson said.
The Chinese government firmly supports Chinese companies in conducting global trade and cooperation in the civilian drone sector, and opposes the illegal use of civilian drones for non-peaceful purposes, the spokesperson said, adding that China would continue to track and assess the situation of drone exports and make timely adjustments and improvements to relevant policies.
The adjustments came after China announced export control measures in July 2023 on certain drones and a number of items of drone-related equipment, including lasers, communication instruments, hyperspectral cameras, and anti-drone systems.
Yang Jincai, director of the Shenzhen Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Industry Association in Guangdong province, said the cancellation of temporary controls targeting certain consumer-grade drones will help more Chinese drone makers expand their footprint abroad and develop more high-end and advanced drones to satisfy international demand.
Yang said the optimized export control measures are good news for the development of China's drone industry, as the move will encourage domestic drone enterprises to increase their research and development spending, promote technological advancements, and enhance the core competitiveness of drone products globally.
DJI, the world's largest commercial drone manufacturer by market share, said in a statement to China Daily, ""We are pleased to note the adjustments made to the export control measures by the Ministry of Commerce.""
It added that the revised measures are ""expected to be more favorable for the development and technology application of the entire drone industry"".
DJI stressed that its products are for civilian use only, emphasizing that ""we have never designed, developed or manufactured military-grade equipment, we have never adapted our products or pursued business opportunities for combat operations. We have never marketed or sold our products for combat use in any country"".
The Shenzhen-based company said it will continue to strictly comply with and implement China's export control regulations, and the applicable laws and regulations of the countries and regions where it operates.
Pan Jun, a visiting professor at Donghua University in Shanghai, said the export control adjustment means that Chinese drone enterprises will have more opportunities to enter the international market, adding that it will have a positive impact on the whole industrial chain of drones, including raw material supply, production, sales, and investments.
The scale of China's civilian drone market reached 165 billion yuan ($22.8 billion) in 2023, an increase of 37.96 percent year-on-year, according to a report released by market research company AskCI Consulting. The figure is expected to reach 176.5 billion yuan this year.
Pan Helin, a member of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's Expert Committee for Information and Communication Economy, said, ""The move will enhance the global competitiveness of Chinese drone makers, reduce the compliance costs of these enterprises, and benefit the high-quality development of China's drone sector.""

Chinese scientists develop humanoid robots with realistic facial expressions
 (Xinhua) 17:05, August 01, 2024
NANJING, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite the summer vacation, Liu Xiaofeng, a professor at Hohai University in east China's Jiangsu Province, and his research team have remained immersed in the laboratory, focusing on developing humanoid robots with highly expressive facial features.
Eyeing on optimizing human-robot emotional interaction technology, the research team has developed a new algorithm for generating facial expressions on humanoid robots.
At its 26th annual meeting on July 2, the China Association of Science and Technology listed research on emotionally intelligent digital humans and robots at the top of the 10 major cutting-edge scientific issues of 2024.
On the same day, Liu's team published their findings -- a new approach for action unit (AU)-driven facial expression disentangled synthesis -- in the international journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics.
Humanoid robots often struggle to convey the intricate and authentic facial expressions characteristic of humans, potentially hampering user engagement, Liu said.
""To address this challenge, we introduced a comprehensive two-stage methodology to empower our autonomous affective robot with the capacity to exhibit rich and natural facial expressions,"" he added.
Liu explained that in the first stage, their method generates nuanced robot facial expression images guided by AUs. In the subsequent phase, they actualize an affective robot with multifaceted degrees of freedom for facial movements, enabling it to embody the synthesized fine-grained facial expressions.
Ni Rongrong, from Changzhou University who is a co-author of the paper, said that people may be more familiar with various ""digital humans"" and ""virtual anchors,"" which can generate a variety of real-time expressions.
However, humanoid robots face specific constraints, such as the size and number of motors, which make this more challenging, Ni added. ""For example, the humanoid robot we previously used had only nine micro motors beneath its facial surface, far fewer than the number of muscles in a human face.""
Therefore, according to Ni, the team divided the nine motors on the humanoid robot's face into 17 AUs to enable richer expressions and smoother transitions through coordinated movements.
Liu said that the team of researchers plans to expand the number of facial AUs and endow a robot with delicate expressions autonomously.
Liu believes that as the emotional interaction capabilities of humanoid robots continue to advance, these robots -- equipped with both high emotional and intellectual quotients -- will become widely used in nursing homes, kindergartens, special education schools, and other settings.
""The humanoid robots will not only assist or replace humans in completing some tasks but also bring more emotional value,"" he said.
