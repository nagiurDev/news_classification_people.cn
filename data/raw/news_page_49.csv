China starts building phase II of spallation neutron source to help boost sci-tech innovation,2024-04-01,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0401/c90000-20151961.html,"Home>>
		
China starts building phase II of spallation neutron source to help boost sci-tech innovation
 (Xinhua) 14:15, April 01, 2024
SHENZHEN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China began to upgrade its spallation neutron source, a large scientific facility dubbed as a ""super microscope"" to probe the structure of the microscopic world, to help boost scientific and technological innovation.
The construction of the phase II of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), the nation's first research facility providing the most intense pulsed neutron beams for scientific research, was launched in Dongguan city, south China's Guangdong Province, on Saturday.
The CSNS phase II project includes building 11 new neutron instruments, experimental terminals and user laboratories. And the proton beam power of the source, one of the key performance indicators of the facility, is expected to increase from 100 kW to 500 kW, said Wang Sheng, deputy director of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and general director of the project.
The construction of the CSNS phase II is expected to take five years and nine months, according to Wang.
""After completion of the phase II, the source can generate more neutrons at the same time, which means the time of the experiments could be shortened, and the resolution of the experiments could be improved, enabling the measurement of smaller samples and the study on faster dynamic processes,"" Wang said.
The application scope and capabilities of the CSNS will be greatly improved after the completion of the phase II, and the number of experiments will also increase significantly to assist in cutting-edge scientific research and economic development, Wang added.
The large scientific facility can produce and accelerate protons before smashing them into the target to produce neutrons, and the neutron beams will be directed to hit material samples. Researchers can thus accurately infer the atomic structure of the materials by measuring the distribution of scattered neutrons and their changes in energy and momentum.
Neutron scattering has made a contribution to many areas of physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and materials engineering, where applications range from consumer products to photovoltaic materials and drug delivery.
Construction of the CSNS project started in 2011 under the direction of the IHEP, with a total investment of 2.3 billion yuan (323 million U.S. dollars). Put into use in August 2018, the CSNS is the fourth pulse spallation neutron source in the world after the UK, the United States and Japan.
Currently, the number of registered users of the CSNS has exceeded 6,000, and more than 1,500 experimental projects, including over 100 conducted by users from overseas, have been completed, achieving important scientific results, Wang said.
Focusing on international sci-tech frontiers and serving the country's major development demands, the CSNS has supported research in the fields of energy, physics, materials and engineering, such as studies on aerospace components, lithium-ion batteries, solar cell, rare earth magnetism, high-temperature superconductivity, functional thin films, high-strength alloys and single particle effects on chips, said Zhang Junrong, who is in charge of the user experiments and application of the CSNS project.
""There is an urgent need to upgrade the CSNS to meet the increasing demand of the users,"" said Zhang, adding that the phase II of the CSNS will support a wider range of research in fields such as magnetic superconducting quantum material, life science, drug development and catalytic material design.
At the launching ceremony of the CSNS phase II project held on Saturday, Lu Fangjun, head of major science and technology infrastructure management department of the CAS, said the CSNS has provided a world-class neutron science research platform for users, and has achieved a large number of important achievements in fields such as new energy materials, aerospace and deep-sea exploration.
The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is becoming one of the regions with the most concentrated major scientific and technological infrastructures in China. The CSNS will provide strong support for the upgrading of industrial structure, high-quality economic development and improvement of people's health in the region, Lu said.

Medical brain-computer interface technology advancing in China,2024-04-01,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0401/c90000-20151820.html,"Home>>
		
Medical brain-computer interface technology advancing in China
 (Xinhua) 10:08, April 01, 2024
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The first thing Wu Xiaotian (pseudonym) does every day is adjust the parameters of his brain pacemaker through a mobile app. He then activates a controller next to his chest and, with a beep from the device, he feels revitalized, as though he has regained control over his body.
Wu, who was born in the 1990s, has been battling depression for over a decade. After various treatments had little effect, he participated in a clinical research program utilizing a brain-computer interface at Ruijin Hospital, which is affiliated with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and underwent surgery in 2022 after strict ethical screening.
Wu now carries a brain pacemaker roughly the size of two coins in his chest. The pacemaker is linked to electrodes implanted in areas of his brain that control emotion. The electrodes, which each have eight stimulation points, discharge when Wu activates an external switch, stimulating specific brain regions to improve his mood.
Through the mobile app, Wu can alternate between work and rest modes tailored to provide different stimuli. By utilizing these modes, he can invigorate himself during the day and relax at night.
Wu says he was reborn with the help of brain-computer interface technology. ""The day of the surgery was my second birthday,"" he said.
Sun Bomin, who works at Ruijin Hospital, explained that mental disorders such as depression are mainly caused by the dysfunction of nerve circuits in the brain, and that brain-computer interface technology can provide patients with neuroregulatory treatment.
The clinical research program has reported a depression symptom improvement rate of over 60 percent among 23 participating patients following surgery.
Brain-computer interface technology has also brought new hope to the field of neural rehabilitation.
A team led by professor Hong Bo at Tsinghua University, in collaboration with a team at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, in December implanted a Neural Electronic Opportunity (NEO) device in a patient who had a severe spinal injury in a car accident. Their work was successful in enabling the patient to use his mind to control the movement of a cursor across a screen.
Another patient, a man who has been quadriplegic for 14 years, underwent NEO implant surgery at Xuanwu Hospital last October. He can now grasp a bottle of water independently using an air-filled glove driven by brain waves, reporting a grasping accuracy rate of over 90 percent.
Blending biological and machine intelligence, brain-computer interface technology is regarded as a significant advancement in health care.
According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology's report on the development and application of brain-computer interface technology (2023), medical treatment is the main application field of brain-computer interface technology in China.
Zhao Guoguang, a professor at Xuanwu Hospital, explained that the technology processes algorithms and analyzes signals to translate human thoughts into machine-recognizable instructions, allowing patients to control external devices such as pneumatic hands and mechanical arms, realizing brain-computer connection.
The technology's applications are categorized as invasive, involving direct brain signal extraction through implanted electrodes, and non-invasive, utilizing wearable detection equipment to collect brain signals. Invasive means the technology comes with high risks and costs, while non-invasive means it is challenged by weak and unstable signals.
According to the report, there are nearly 200 medical brain-computer interface enterprises in China, with 25 percent of those enterprises working with implantable technology and 75 percent working with non-implantable technology.
China in January released guidelines to support the technological innovation, industrial cultivation and safety governance of future industries, including the brain-computer interface industry.
While advancements in brain-computer interface technology are accelerating globally, challenges persist, including technical complexities, limited patient participation in clinical trials, and strict ethical requirements.
Luo Minmin, co-director of the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing, said that although brain-computer interface technology has bright application prospects, it is currently in its clinical trial stage and has not yet delivered market-oriented products.
The technology still needs to see breakthroughs in multiple fields. If related technology encounters obstacles, practical application will be challenging. Therefore, it is crucial that synergistic progress is achieved in brain science, clinical medicine and engineering related to the development of new electrodes and chips, Luo said.
Many patients are hesitant to participate in brain-computer interface clinical trials due to concerns over surgical risks and potential sequelae, Hong said, noting that patients can only be persuaded to participate in the trials when offered a semi-invasive compromise solution.
That means that non-invasive and semi-invasive approaches could be the logical technical routes to advance the industrialization of brain-computer interface technology in the country, Hong said.
Concerns have also been expressed over the privacy and safety of patients, and over the ethics of the emerging technology. China in February adopted ethical guidelines for brain-computer interface research -- the first guidelines of their kind in the country -- stipulating that frontier technology should be used principally for therapeutic purposes.
The development of a secure data-processing scheme is also necessary to protect patients' electrical brain activity data and other personal information, said Liu Shuang, deputy dean of the Medical School of Tianjin University.

GUIYANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish and most sensitive radio telescope, has received applications from 15 foreign countries and approved a total of nearly 900 hours of observation access for foreign research teams since March 31, 2021.
According to Sun Chun, engineer in charge of measurement and control of the FAST, the 15 countries include Germany, Italy and France, and the applications mainly involve fast radio burst observations, pulsar observations, and neutral hydrogen surveys.
Having earned a doctorate in pulsar astrophysics at the University of Manchester, British astronomer Ralph Eatough works as a pulsar astronomer at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Eatough said opening up the FAST to the world means that now astronomers have the possibility to perform experiments that were previously not possible due to insufficient telescope sensitivity, and that a prime example is the potential to detect pulsars located in external galaxies.
Jiang Peng, chief engineer of the FAST, said that in order to maintain the telescope's leading position in the world, his team will make every effort to ensure that the FAST becomes even more stable and efficient.
Currently, the annual observation time of the telescope is about 5,300 hours, and it plays an important role in the continuous output of scientific research achievements.
Located in a deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province, the FAST officially opened to international scientists on March 31, 2021.

The total volume of China's registered drones reached 1.27 million as of the end of 2023, increasing by 32.2 percent year-on-year, according to Civil Aviation Administration of China on Friday.
The Government Work Report of 2024, which was approved during the two sessions earlier this month, stated that China will develop new quality productive forces including fostering new growth engines in fields such as the low-altitude economy and underlined the development path of the drone industry.
The rapid growth of the drone industry in China will be a long-lasting trend and is expected to be accelerated in the future, Wang Yanan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Friday, adding that the types of civil drone will be further segmented and used in more industries.
""China's leading manufacturing capability can produce nearly every type of drones, and can support the rapid growth of the industry,"" he noted.
In 2023, accumulated flight hours of China's civil drones were recorded at 23.11 million hours, up 11.8 percent year-on-year. Civil drones have been widely deployed in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, livestock farming and fishery, as well as entertainment and photography.
In addition, preliminary management mode and technical standards of drones used in urban scenarios and logistics sectors now have the foundation to be further promoted. Manned and unmanned drone flights have also entered the test and verification phase, according to Xinhua News Agency.
In response to some Western countries' smears that China-produced drones are being used for military purposes, Wang said that China has issued strict regulations on drone exports and taken concrete measures to maintain global security.
Chinese authorities on July 2023 issued two notices implementing export controls on certain unmanned aerial vehicles and related items, a move expected from a responsible major country and one that is conducive to regional security, especially when drones for civilian use are increasingly being converted for military purposes.
""However, a consumer drone cannot be clearly tracked after being sold and some Western countries' allegations are an issue of global security governance, which is not solely China's obligation,"" said Wang.

NANJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- An international research team led by Chinese scientists has for the first time presented experimental evidence of a graviton-like particle called chiral graviton modes (CGMs), with the findings published in the scientific journal Nature on Thursday.
These findings mark the first experimental substantiation of the concept of gravitons, posited by pioneering works in quantum gravity since the 1930s, in a condensed matter system, said Du Lingjie, leader of the team and a professor at the School of Physics, Nanjing University, in east China's Jiangsu Province.
Graviton is a yet-to-be-discovered elementary particle that is well-known in the realm of quantum gravity. The existence of gravitons could fill critical gaps between quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of general relativity, making a vital contribution to modern physics, and studying graviton-like particles like CGMs could help examine graviton physics, Du said.
Du added that the research is based on theories suggesting the existence of graviton modes under fractional quantum Hall states in condensed matter, which bear similar properties to gravitons.
The team started their experimental program five years ago, and then spent over three years designing and assembling specialized experimental equipment for research under extremely low temperatures and strong magnetic fields.
Du and the team expect further discoveries in quantum physics with the experimental equipment.

SHANGHAI/XI'AN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists have completed the genetic profile of an ancient Chinese ethnic minority emperor via genome analysis, according to local archaeologists on Thursday.
Emperor Wu of the Xianbei-led Northern Zhou Dynasty (557-581), also known as Yuwen Yong, was an ambitious leader who died at 36. He belonged to the Xianbei nomadic group, which originated from the Mongolian Plateau.
His skull and bones were discovered during an excavation held in 1994 and 1995 at the site of his tomb. By spending six years studying DNA found in his remains, scientists led by Wen Shaoqing from the Institute of Archaeological Science of Fudan University, managed to decode key features of the emperor including the color of his hair, skin and eyes.
The reconstructed face showed that Yuwen Yong had black hair, yellow skin and brown eyes, while his appearance was typical for people from the east or northeast of Asia. This is different to what some people had imagined the Xianbei people would look like.
""Many people believed that the emperor had an exotic appearance, but the outcome is surprisingly different to their expectations,"" said associate professor Wen. ""He shared the closest genetic relationship with ancient Khitan and Heishui Mohe samples and modern Daur and Mongolian populations but also showed additional affinity with ancient Yellow River farmers.""
The appearance of the Xianbei people had been a controversial topic, with some historical records indicating that the group had characteristics with thick beards, yellow hair and protuberant noses. Other historical records suggested that there was no difference in appearance between Xianbei people and other people in the northeast of Asia. ""Our findings are more in line with the second viewpoint,"" Wen stated.
The tomb of the emperor was discovered in 1993 in a village of the city of Xianyang in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
By analyzing Yuwen Yong's genomic data, Wen's team also found that a large proportion of his ancestral components, about 61 percent, came from the ancient Northeastern Asian people. ""Our study has revealed genetic diversities among available ancient Xianbei individuals from different regions. The formation of the Xianbei group was probably a dynamic process influenced by admixture with surrounding populations,"" Wen said.
In addition, research also found that this emperor might have died from chronic arsenic poisoning due to long-term use of a pellet, which was believed by ancient people to achieve eternal life.
Archaeologists believed that research on Yuwen Yong was key to understanding ethnic integration in Chinese history, especially the integration of the majority Han population and the northern nomadic ethnic groups.
This research effort was also considered a breakthrough in archaeological studies, particularly due to the abundance of research materials available in China.
""Molecular archaeology can bring history back to life, with the only challenge now being the ability to obtain high-quality genomic data of ancient people,"" said Wen.

"Scenic island in E China in pursuit of ""zero-carbon""",2024-03-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0329/c90000-20151122.html,"Home>>
		
Scenic island in E China in pursuit of ""zero-carbon""

FUZHOU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Solar-powered tiles glowing with prismatic lights in the evening on the offshore island of Meizhou are now a must-see attraction at this holiday resort near the eastern Chinese city of Putian.
The 75 floor tiles are powered by an intelligent solar system equipped with weather sensors and smart controllers that can automatically adjust their power-generation mode -- to ensure that they can work in any weather conditions.
The photogenic pavement is located on an elongated island known for its charming coastal scenery and which is believed to be the birthplace of the Chinese goddess Mazu. This pavement was built not only to provide sightseeing fun, but also to serve as a landmark reminding visitors that the island is striving to be a carbon-free tourist destination.
Meizhou Island is rich in renewable resources. It is home to 23 solar power projects that generate around 1.69 million kWh of power annually.
In 2023, supplemented with wind power generated by a coastal town, 50 percent of the power supply on the island came from clean energy.
Meizhou is projected to become a zero-carbon island in 2025, forming part of China's national endeavor to realize its duel carbon goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2060.
On the island, which is prone to seasonal drought, renewable energy is stored at a power storage station and used for sewage disposal during the dry season. Last year, a total of 60,000 KWh of solar and wind power electricity was used to treat sanitary sewage on the island, while the island also uses reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation and gardening purposes.
Expenditure for wastewater treatment on the island has been reduced by more than 30 percent thanks to renewable energy sources, said Du Yong, a water purification manager on Meizhou.
Meanwhile, buildings at Mazu Forum Plaza are equipped with motorized sunshades capable of adapting to the direction of the sun's rays, thereby generating clean power while also adjusting their flip angles to provide improved shading.
The island's promotional video is loop-played on a 12-square-meter transparent screen. This waterproof photoelectric transparent screen, consisting of translucent CdTe power-generating glass, can draw power from the sun and serve as an energy source.
Hostels and restaurants on the island previously used diesel and coal gas for cooking, but all of them now rely on electric stoves.
In addition, all 376 buses on the island are fully electrified. ""These pure electric buses are energy-saving and eco-friendly. With the help of government subsidies, they can reduce operating costs by 60 percent in comparison with fuel vehicles,"" said Yu Jianshan, manager of a local bus company.
In the future, Meizhou Island is planning to build a ""digital twin"" platform to simulate the island's external environment such as weather, people flow and business density, thus offering a digital solution for renewable energy distribution in the physical world based on relevant data.
""Striving to create a 'zero-carbon island' supported by a renewable power system, the island is already on its way,"" said Cai Zhe, a manager at State Grid Meizhou Island Power Supply.
