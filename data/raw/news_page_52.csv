NVIDIA deepens ties with Chinese firms despite US restrictions
 (Global Times) 11:20, March 20, 2024
Despite Washington's relentless efforts to restrict the development of the Chinese chip industry, US chipmaker NVIDIA said on Monday that it is expanding collaboration with Chinese enterprises. Experts noted that the ""small yard and high fence"" tactic of the US will eventually backfire on its own tech advancement.
Chinese companies such as BYD, Hyper and XPENG have decided to adopt NVIDIA's DRIVE Thor - an in-vehicle computing platform created for generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications - NVIDIA said in a statement on Monday as the company's annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) kicked off.
""BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is expanding its ongoing collaboration with NVIDIA from the car to the cloud,"" read the statement.
""In addition to building its next-generation EV fleets on DRIVE Thor, BYD plans to use NVIDIA's AI infrastructure for cloud-based AI development and training technologies, along with the NVIDIA Isaac and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms to develop tools and applications for virtual factory planning and retail configurators,"" the AI chip industry leader said.
At the GTC, two other Chinese automakers - Hyper and XPENG - also announced plans to use the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform as the AI brain for their next-generation EV fleets, joining Li Auto and ZEEKR, which previously made similar announcements.
Also at the GTC, technology giant Lenovo announced new hybrid AI solutions, built-in collaboration with NVIDIA ""that deliver the power of tailored generative AI applications to every enterprise and cloud,"" according to a statement Lenovo sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.
Amid the US government's ongoing restrictions on chip exports to China and crackdown on China's high-tech industries, NVIDIA has employed various strategies to ensure it doesn't sever its ties with the Chinese market, Ma Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
Previously, NVIDIA tried to hold onto its market share by exporting ""downgraded"" chips to China, but it faced a lukewarm reception. Now, NVIDIA is taking a different approach by expanding technical collaboration with Chinese companies. This approach could allow NVIDIA to maintain its market presence without violating certain restrictions imposed by the US government, Ma said.
This situation clearly showed that the US business sector is reluctant to ""decouple"" from China, highlighting the resilience of economic and technological cooperation between the two countries, Ma stressed.
In recent years, the US government has spared no effort in suppressing China's high-tech industry, with semiconductors as a focal point. From restricting American companies' chip exports to China to luring or pressuring its so-called allies to form small cliques, the US has attempted to isolate China from the global chip value chain.
However, ""China is one of the major semiconductor markets in the world. To fragment the market, destabilize global industry and supply chains, and stymie efficiency and innovation serves no one's interests,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing on February 27.
What has happened shows that ""small yard and high fence"" tactics will not stop China's innovation-driven development, nor will they do any good to US companies or the entire semiconductor industry, Mao said.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, Chinese chip manufacturer HiSilicon's shipment volume reached 6.8 million units, up more than 50 times year-on-year, media reports said, citing data from Canalys.
US restrictions on chip exports have created some market opportunities for Chinese companies. Under the premise of equivalent performance, domestically produced equipment is more secure, sustainable and has lower risks, Ma said.
The Biden administration's efforts to curb China's high-tech industry have failed to halt the advancement of China's chip sector. Instead, they have only accelerated the drive for independent research and domestic substitution, pushing China further toward self-reliance in its products, Ma said.

China launched a relay satellite on Wednesday morning to lunar orbit to pave the way for the space power's prospective trailblazing expeditions to the moon.
The Queqiao 2, or Magpie Bridge 2, satellite was lifted atop a Long March 8 carrier rocket that blasted off at 8:31 am from a coastal launch pad at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in China's southernmost island province of Hainan.
After a short flight, the satellite is programmed to be released from the rocket and will then enter into a lunar transfer trajectory.
In the next few days, the spacecraft is scheduled to carry out a series of maneuvers such as a mid-course trajectory correction and a braking operation before it enters an elliptical frozen orbit around the moon to become the second relay satellite above the silver celestial body.
After its arrival in the predetermined orbital position, Queqiao 2 will conduct two-way communication tests with the Chang'e 4 probe that is on the lunar surface and the Chang'e 6, which is waiting for launch at the Wenchang center, to examine its performance, according to space officials.
Developed by the China Academy of Space Technology, Queqiao 2 is based on the CAST2000 satellite framework. It weighs about 1.2 metric tons and has two major payloads － a 4.2-meter parabolic antenna for communications with lunar probes and a 0.6-meter parabolic antenna used to transmit data to the ground control.
Queqiao 2 is primarily tasked with relaying signals and data between the Chang'e 6 robotic mission, which has been scheduled to be launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket before July.
In the long term, the satellite will also serve the Chang'e 7 and 8 missions that will be the basis for an ambitious multinational plan known as the International Lunar Research Station to be constructed in the 2030s.
Wednesday's flight marked the third mission of the Long March 8, a medium-lift rocket designed and built by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, and the first time the type has been used in a lunar mission.
To ensure a successful launch, engineers at the academy designed six flight plans in case that the most preferred launch date is postponed due to bad weather or other unfavorable situations.
They also worked out a new technology that enables the rocket to withstand the effects of upper-atmospheric winds, which often cause hazards to a vertically flying craft.
Moreover, engineers placed additional heat-proof paint-coat on the Long March 8 to offset the extreme heat that challenges every rocket bound for lunar transfer trajectory, according to the academy.

What China's semiconductor price advantage means for US 'chip war'
By Hu Weijia (Global Times) 10:16, March 20, 2024

The US has sought to restrict exports of semiconductor technologies and chipmaking equipment to crush China but, so far, the effect has been limited. As a result, it seems the US has begun to adjust its strategy, consulting its allies to combat China's chip exports.
Washington's ill-intentioned chip war may have entered the second half but it won't be easy for the US side to score points.
Bloomberg published an article on Monday with a headline ""EU Weighs Joining US in Reviewing Risks of Chinese Legacy Chips."" The news has not been confirmed, but it has attracted attention because many believe that Washington is consulting its allies to label Chinese-made chips as a threat to national security, and hopes that US allies could reduce purchases from Chinese semiconductor manufacturers.
In recent years, the US has expanded controls on exports of semiconductors, chipmaking equipment, and other cutting-edge technologies to China, but those controls have not stifled China's technological progress. On the contrary, they have forced China to pursue a path of independent innovation and overcome challenges in commercializing semiconductor technologies.
It's undeniable that Washington's chip war has imposed pressure, but China's manufacturing capacity for semiconductors, especially for mature or lower-end chips, has improved. As a result, the US is constantly adjusting its policy in response to China's changes.
Beyond export controls, there is something new in recent developments. More focus is likely to be put on restricting sales of semiconductors produced in the Chinese mainland. This may open a new chapter in Washington's ill-intentioned chip war: after the US failed to restrict China's semiconductor production capacity, it may put more focus on restricting semiconductor sales.
However, Washington will find it more difficult to crack down on the sales of semiconductors, even if it pressures its allies to label those chips as a threat to national security, partly due to the chips' price advantages over their Western counterparts.
Chips made in the mainland are often considered more affordable compared with chips made in Western countries. The price advantage of made-in-China products can be attributed to multiple factors, including a complete industry chain, relatively low labor costs and scientific and technological innovation. China has mastered technologies for mature or lower-end chips, so local chipmakers can utilize China's manufacturing advantages and collaborate with China's supply chain, transforming them into price advantages.
As reported by the VOA, the cost of manufacturing semiconductors in the US may be 30-45 percent higher than the rest of the world. Some industry insiders believe China's manufacturing costs are much lower than those of the US.
Currently, 28-nanometer versions are the most widely used chips in manufacturing applications. According to a report released by research firm TrendForce in January, China has 44 operational semiconductor wafer fabs, with an additional 22 under construction. By the end of 2024, 32 Chinese wafer fabs will expand their capacity for 28-nm and older mature chips.
TrendForce predicts that by 2027, China's share of mature process capacity in the global market will increase from 31 percent in 2023 to 39 percent, with further growth potential if equipment procurement progresses smoothly.
An electric vehicle can easily have more than 3,000 chips. So, the price of semiconductors is a significant factor in determining industrial products' price competitiveness in the global market. Chips are critical components in a wide range of consumer and industrial products. It is unwise for any economy to block cheap chips, because such a decision will cause incalculable losses to the economy.
China and the EU have strong complementarity in strengthening cooperation in the field of semiconductors. Hopefully European policymakers can maintain strategic sobriety and rationality, and provide a stable and fair environment for foreign mature or lower-end chips.

Chinese researchers apply freeze-drying technology to tumor treatment
 (Xinhua) 09:52, March 20, 2024
HANGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has used freeze-dried lymph nodes to improve the curative effect of anti-tumor drugs, according to Zhejiang University.
Cell drugs are in the ascendant as tumor targeted therapy in recent years. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells which can accurately identify and eliminate tumor cells at fixed points have been synthesized and used in the clinical treatment of hematological tumors.
However, it has been a challenge to make CAR T cells play a lasting and efficient role at the site of solid tumors.
Researchers from the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Zhejiang University and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University's School of Medicine came up with the idea of loading CAR T cells with lymph nodes that are often removed during tumor surgery.
They use freeze-drying technology to effectively preserve the porous structure and the active ingredients of lymph nodes, and use them as a medium for storing and delivering anti-tumor cell drugs, making the treatment more potent and long-lasting.
The research team has verified through animal models that the new technique can effectively inhibit the recurrence of tumors after surgery, said Gu Zhen with the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Zhejiang University, one of the corresponding authors of the study.
The study has been published in the journal Nature Materials.

BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Municipality will focus on building itself into a major international sci-tech innovation center and leverage its strategic role as the national capital to develop new quality productive forces in a drive to enhance the city's high-quality development, local authorities said on Tuesday.
In recent years, Beijing's efforts have achieved remarkable results. The city has topped the list of ""Nature Index -- Science Cities"" for eight consecutive years, ranking among the most innovative cities in the world, the city's mayor Yin Yong said at a press conference.
The volume of technology contract transactions in Beijing exceeded 850 billion yuan (about 119.74 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023, with an average of 337 technology enterprises established each day.
In the face of a new round of global technological and industrial changes, the capital will continue to make efforts to improve its sci-tech research capabilities, deepen the reform of the sci-tech system, and strengthen the cultivation and introduction of talent, Yin said.
""We will concentrate on breaking through key core technologies and aim at the commanding heights of industrial development in more than 20 directions, such as future information, health, manufacturing, energy, materials and space,"" Yin added.
The metropolis has upgraded its urban management over the years, especially in the field of high-level autonomous driving. Three years ago, it took the lead in adopting the vehicle-road collaboration technology to promote the development of autonomous driving technology, according to Yin.
The area for autonomous driving in Beijing will expand from 160 square kilometers to 600 square kilometers this year, and the application of the technology will be accessible at five major railway stations as well as Beijing Daxing International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport.
""We hope to attract more leading enterprises and R&D institutions to the field of autonomous driving, and to improve the upstream and downstream supporting facilities of the industrial chain. We welcome all kinds of capital, especially long-term capital, to increase investment in this field,"" Yin said.

""Science and technology backyards"" contribute to agricultural, rural development
By Xu Peiyu (People's Daily) 14:56, March 19, 2024
Jujube farmer Ding Taiping in Xiawa township, Binzhou, east China's Shandong province recently made some new friends - students of a ""science and technology backyard"" (STB) program that studies the cultivation of jujubes from China Agricultural University.
""I've been growing jujubes for many years, but this is the first time I've interacted with university students in the fields,"" said Ding.

He said he thought it would be impossible for these students, who had never set foot in the field, to solve farmers' problems when the STB was established in the township earlier this year.
""But after spending some time together, they've actually tackled some challenges that had troubled me for a long time. Particularly by combining traditional 'local methods' with new techniques through standardized cultivation practices, efficiency has improved significantly,"" Ding told People's Daily.
The STB is a practical and integrated talent cultivation model that China Agricultural University began exploring in 2009. It dispatches postgraduate students in agricultural majors to the field, where they, based on what they have learned theoretically, study and solve real-world problems in agricultural and rural development, with an aim to cultivate high-level agricultural talents and serve the modernization of agriculture and rural areas.
Since the first STB program was launched in 2009, this model has soon gained widespread recognition, attracting an increasing number of research institutes and universities to join in, including Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University (NWAFU).
In 2021, NWAFU set up a STB program for the studies of vegetable technologies in Jingyang county, Xianyang, northwest China's Shaanxi province, which serves three counties and 17 demonstration agricultural parks in Xianyang.
Zhang Mingke, associate research fellow at NWAFU and chief expert at the Jingyang STB, said the program develops and introduces new crop varieties, and studies techniques such as efficient cultivation and facility soil secondary salinization improvement and restoration.

New varieties and technologies developed by the program have been introduced to 12 counties and districts in Shaanxi province, as well as Qinghai province and Ningxia Hui autonomous region. They have been applied on over 1.52 million mu (around 101,333 hectares), generating over 200 million yuan ($27.8 million) in economic benefits, Zhang told People's Daily.
""Over the past more than a decade, the STB model has pioneered a new path of deep integration between scientists and farmers, and close collaboration between technology and industry. This has unleashed the potential of increasing farmers' incomes, while cultivating a high-quality agricultural talent pool that is rooted in rural areas,"" said Zhong Denghua, Party head of China Agricultural University.
To date, over 1,200 STBs have been set up by 74 institutions across the country, which involve more than 2,700 experts and 5,200 postgraduate students. According to incomplete statistics, these STBs have introduced and made innovations on 284 green agricultural production technologies, which are applied on a total area of 566 million mu and have increased income or cut costs by over 70 billion yuan.
While emerging across China, the STBs have also been sharing their experiences with the rest of the world.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been promoting the STB model globally for three consecutive years from 2021 to 2023, hailing it as a typical case of assisting smallholder farmers.
Last September, FAO official Selvaraju Ramasamy visited Quzhou county in north China's Hebei province, where China's first STB was established. He was impressed to learn that local farmers were actually ""experts"" in technology and marketing and were able to earn over 2,800 yuan per mu annually.
""Remarkable! This demonstrates the value of promoting the STB model worldwide,"" he exclaimed.

In 2019, China Agricultural University launched a training program to cultivate young African talents that would help improve smallholder production in Africa. Augustine Talababi Phiri, an agronomist from Malawi, joined the program.
Last November, three STBs were established in Malawi. Thanks to his knowledge learned and experience gained in China, Phiri was appointed the head of a STB in Lisasadzi, Malawi's Kasungu District, promoting the Chinese model locally.
A staff member of China Agricultural University told People's Daily that the training program has nurtured 72 agriculture-related graduate students from over 10 African countries so far.
African farmers said they welcome the STBs and hope these programs can bring practical technologies to help them grow more food.
Moreover, NWAFU has taken the lead in establishing the Silkroad Agricultural Education and Research Innovation Alliance, which has been joined by 106 scientific and educational institutions and enterprises from 18 countries so far.
Zhang said the universities are responsible for the research, development, and talent support related to crop varieties, products, and technologies, while local governments organize order-based production. Chinese enterprises then demonstrate the achievements and procure the products, achieving deep integration of production, education, research, and application.
""In the next step, NWAFU and China Agricultural University will cooperate with the FAO, as well as relevant countries' agricultural departments and enterprises to establish more STBs and cultivate more young talents willing to work on the frontline of agricultural production,"" Zhang said.

Chinese tech company EHang Holdings Limited has begun to sell its self-developed unmanned electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft EH216-S on Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao at a cost of 2.39 million yuan ($332,032) per unit, the Global Times observed on Monday.
He Tianxing, a deputy president of EHang, told the Global Times that it was not only for online sale, but also aimed to inform the public the development potential of low-altitude economy in the future.
The EH216-S last December obtained the standard Airworthiness Certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which marked the eVTOL aircraft becoming eligible for commercial operation.
EH216-S Passenger-Carrying UAV System Obtains Standard Airworthiness Certificate from CAAC and the Certified Aircraft Delivered to Customer in Guangzhou.
Aside from its main selling points including its small size, easy take-off, landing and re-charge ability, as well as quietness, EHang made multiple backups for core parts such as propellers, electric engine, flying control system and batteries.
The Government Work Report released during the recently concluded two sessions earlier this month stated that China will foster new growth engines in fields such as biomanufacturing, commercial spaceflight, and the low-altitude economy.
Analysts pointed out that low-altitude transport can help reduce waste once ground transport has reached its limit in megacities.
Following the announced policy, many cities have taken measures to develop the sector. As the country's first trial province for low-altitude air space management, Southwest China's Sichuan Province simplified low-altitude flight test applications. East China's Anhui also crafted rules to develop low-altitude economy, stating to accelerate the development of the industry in Hefei and Wuhu, two major cities there.
In addition, Shenzhen city in South China's Guangdong Province has published a set of documents and government regulations supporting the development of the low-altitude economy in the province, according to Xinhua News Agency.
As of 2025, the output value of low-altitude economy in China is estimated to reach 3 to 5 trillion yuan, according to a recent survey by the International Digital Economy Academy.

Chinese scientists develop new treatment for tendon-bone injuries
 (Xinhua) 10:16, March 19, 2024
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has developed a multicellular scaffold based on inorganic bioceramics for treating tendon-to-bone injuries.
Restriction of motor activity due to loss of natural structure is a major cause of decreased life quality in patients suffering from tendon-to-bone injuries.
To solve this problem, the research team, led by the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics (SIC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, combined manganese silicate (MS) nanoparticles with tendon/bone-related cells to construct an immunomodulatory multicellular scaffold to achieve integrated tendon-to-bone regeneration.
The scaffold not only demonstrated diverse biological activities in vitro, but also achieved immune regulation, multi-tissue integration regeneration and motor function recovery in a variety of animal models of rotator cuff injury.
The study provides a new concept for achieving immunomodulation and integrated regeneration of tendon-bone and other tissue interfaces, said Wu Chengtie with the SIC, who led the research.
The study was recently published in the journal Science Advances.

An undersea tunnel of a high-speed railway was completed in South China on Friday, setting a new record in the construction of high-speed railway tunnels in China.
As the Yongxing tunnel boring machine reached the receiving well in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, the Zhanjiang Bay Undersea Tunnel, a pivotal project of the Guangzhou-Zhanjiang High-speed Railway, was completed after 33 months of construction, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the new railway.
It has also demonstrated the remarkable progress and technological achievements in China's high-speed railway infrastructure.
The Zhanjiang Bay Undersea Tunnel spans a total length of 9,640 meters, with a shield section measuring 7,551 meters.
It is designed as a single tunnel with double tracks, crossing the seabed of the Zhanjiang Bay and the urban area of Zhanjiang.
The tunnel used one Yongxing tunnel boring machine to excavate the tunnel, crossing a 2,500-meter sea section and a 5,051-meter section of land.
Notably, the tunnel is China's longest single-headed undersea high-speed railway shield tunnel, showcasing the country's remarkable engineering prowess.
""Single-headed shield refers to the method of using a single tunnel boring machine to excavate continuously from one end to the other,"" said Yin Yihao, an engineer from China Railway's 14th Bureau Group, which was responsible for the tunnel's construction.
Yin also noted that in traditional large-diameter shield tunneling, other methods are commonly employed, such as using tunnel boring machines to excavate from both sides and carry out seabed docking in the middle.
However, Yin said that these traditional methods were not applied in the Zhanjiang Bay Undersea Tunnel due to the complicated geological conditions.
""The single-headed shield tunnel is safer and more efficient in this case,"" he said.
The Yongxing shield tunneling machine, with a diameter of 14.33 meters, is about as tall as a 5-story building. The machine dug as deep as about 50 meters beneath the water during construction, bearing a great deal of pressure.
""The maximum burial depth of the shield tunnel in the sea area is 52 meters, with water and soil pressure of 5.2 bars, equivalent to bearing 5.2 kilograms of pressure on an area the size of a fingernail,"" said He Ziliang, another engineer from the China Railway's 14th Bureau Group, adding that the team tailored the Yongxing shield tunneling machine specifically for these geological conditions.
Yongxing can excavate at an average speed of 260 meters a month, with a record of 510 meters per month.
Wu Chunzhao, a senior engineer of the China Railway Design Corp, the general contractor of the railway, explained the reason for building an undersea tunnel instead of a bridge.
""Building a tunnel preserves the beautiful urban skyline of the Zhanjiang Bay, and also avoids the impact of the project on the marine ecological environment,"" he said.
Wu also noted that a bridge will affect the large vessels' navigation, but the tunnel will not do this.
""It also mitigates the impact of typhoons, which often happen in this area. High-speed rail operations are easily affected by severe weather, such as typhoons, and the subsea tunnel effectively mitigates the safety issues of high-speed rail operations caused by typhoons,"" he added.
The tunnel is a key project of a high-speed railway linking Guangzhou and Zhanjiang in Guangdong.
According to Hu Jijun from Guangdong Guangzhou-Zhanjiang High-Speed Railway Corp, the investor of the railway, the completion of the tunnel has laid a solid foundation for the completion of the railway, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2025.
The 401-km Guangzhou-Zhanjiang High-Speed Railway, with a designed speed of 350 km per hour, is an important part of China's high-speed railway network. After its opening, the rail travel time between Guangzhou and Zhanjiang will be reduced to about 90 minutes from more than 2.5 hours.
The opening of the railway will further improve the coastal high-speed railway corridor, facilitating the construction of a comprehensive transportation network in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and also boosting the high-quality development of the region.

A relay satellite essential to the upcoming Chang'e 6 moon mission and other future lunar exploration programs is scheduled for launch within the next few days, according to the China National Space Administration.
The combination of the relay satellite Queqiao 2, or Magpie Bridge 2, and a Long March 8 carrier rocket, tasked with lifting the satellite, was moved on Sunday morning to the launching tower at Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province.
The satellite and the rocket were individually transported in February to the Wenchang center, where they were examined and assembled. The rocket will undergo final checks before propellants are loaded, the space administration said in a news release. The launch will take place in due course, it noted.
Queqiao 1, the predecessor of Queqiao 2, was lifted by a Long March 4C rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province in May 2018. It currently serves as a relay platform for the Chang'e 4 lunar mission.
The Chang'e 4 probe landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon in January 2019, becoming the first spacecraft to be operated on the little-known semisphere.
If everything goes according to plan, the Chang'e 6 probe will be launched in the first half of the year, and will become the second spacecraft to reach the moon's far side. It is tasked to bring back samples from the lunar far side, an assignment that is challenging, sophisticated and has never been done before.
Communication services between the Chang'e 4 and Chang'e 6 spacecraft and the Earth require relay satellites due to their special locations. Transmitting signals is thus the primary task of Queqiao 1 and 2.
Pang Zhihao, an expert on space exploration technology who worked at the China Academy of Space Technology for decades, said the fact that Queqiao 2 will be transported using a Long March 8 rocket indicates that this relay satellite is larger and heavier than its predecessor.
""As far as I understand, the Queqiao 2 has been designed to have more functions and a longer life span. It will be key to China's next several lunar missions,"" he said.
The Chang'e 6 spacecraft will have four components — an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module. In addition to sample collection instruments, it will also carry scientific instruments from Pakistan, France, Italy and the European Space Agency, according to its mission planners.

 (Xinhua) 14:13, March 16, 2024
TIANJIN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a novel immunotherapeutic agent for treating colon cancer, according to a recent article in the academic journal ACS Nano.
In animal experiments, the agent, upon successful entry into tumor cells, can enhance T cell effector function to kill tumor cells and suppress colon tumor growth, according to Lu Chunwan from the School of Life Sciences of Tianjin University, one of the authors of the article.
The agent can enhance tumor immunogenicity and inhibit colon tumor growth, with no significant impact on normal cells, said Lu.
Colon cancer, characterized by its long latency period and high mortality rate, poses a severe threat to human health. Among various therapies, immunotherapy is considered one of the most promising treatment directions, according to Lu.
