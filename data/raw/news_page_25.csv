As the US space industry recently faced yet more delays and stagnation with key components including manned spacecraft and space suits ""going wrong,"" NASA has once again resorted to its ""sour grapes"" rhetoric upon seeing China's successful retrieval of fresh lunar soils from the far side of the moon, by claiming that China did not directly invite its scientists to participate in the lunar soil research.
This behavior is a typical blame-shifting trick, Chinese experts said, noting it is clear to all that it is the US' own laws, not China's, that are restricting space cooperation between the two sides. Instead of deceiving themselves by distorting the truth, the US should face up to its own problem of overall weakening engineering capability and the lack of long-term planning in its space industry.
After the Chang'e-6 samples, weighing nearly 2 kilograms, were safely transported to a special laboratory for further study on Friday, NASA spokesperson Faith McKie told media that while China worked with the European Space Agency, France, Italy, and Pakistan on this mission, ""NASA wasn't invited to take part in the moon probe.""
NASA also didn't get ""any direct invitation"" to study China's moon rocks, after it welcomed all scientists from around the world to apply to study them, McKie told NatSec Daily.
Responding to the remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told the Global Times on Monday that China is open to having space exchanges with the US, and we also welcome countries around the world to take part in the study of lunar samples. ""However, the US side seems to have forgotten to mention its domestic legislation such as the Wolf Amendment. The real question is whether US scientists and institutions are allowed by their own government to participate in cooperation with China,"" Mao said.
""The existence of the Wolf Amendment has basically shut the door to space collaboration between the two countries,"" Wang Yanan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Monday.
Even if research institutions in the US have the willingness to work with China on opportunities such as lunar sample research, institutions there must obtain special approval from the US Congress due to the presence of this amendment, Wang explained. Currently, no such ""green light"" is in sight from the Congress.
Furthermore, China's collaboration with international partners is based on equality and mutual benefit, leveraging their respective scientific resources, facilities, and expertise. However, the US only wants what it doesn't have, and its engagement with China would be advantageous only to itself, Wang noted.
NASA has found itself embroiled in a number of thorny issues recently, with the latest being Boeing's Starliner manned spaceship experiencing both helium leaks and thruster issues during a June 6 docking with the International Space Station (ISS), which led to an indefinite delay for its crew's return to Earth, despite NASA's insistence that they are not ""stranded"" in space.
The return of the Starliner capsule, while has already been delayed by two weeks, will be put on hold ""well into the summer"" pending results of new thruster tests, which are scheduled to start Tuesday and will take approximately two weeks or even more, per NASA officials.
Previously on June 24, NASA canceled a spacewalk on the ISS following a ""serious situation,"" when one of the spacesuits experienced a coolant leak in the hatch. While being broadcast on a livestream, the astronauts reported ""literally water everywhere"" as they were preparing for the extravehicular activity, space.com reported.
The report said that this is the second time this particular spacewalk was postponed, after a June 13 attempt with a different astronaut group was pushed back due to a ""spacesuit discomfort.""
The recurring issues with the spacesuits are due to their much-extended service lifespan, media reported, as the puffy white ones US astronauts currently wear were designed more than 40 years ago.
Despite the pressing need to replace them, NASA announced recently that it is abandoning a plan to develop next-generation spacesuits, which had been committed to be delivered by 2026, CNN reported on Thursday.
One of the root causes for such problems is that the US has developed many large technology conglomerates, which for a long time have benefited significantly from government orders and industry monopolies. Consequently, in many complex engineering fields, the level of attention given is greatly insufficient, Wang noted.
It also reflected the US' lack of long-term strategic planning for its manned space program. For instance, the aging spacesuits should have been replaced a decade ago to ensure that operational suits remain in usable condition. Failure to address this issue results in a hindrance to the space station's necessary maintenance tasks and even poses life-threatening risks to astronauts in emergency situations, experts said.
The issues with Boeing's spacecraft and the spacesuits are not isolated problems, but reflected a systemic issue in the US space industry - the overall weakening of engineering capabilities, they noted.

China makes huge progress in studies of lunar samples,2024-07-02,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0702/c90000-20187998.html,"Home>>
		
China makes huge progress in studies of lunar samples
By Zang Chunlei, Yu Sinan (People's Daily) 09:49, July 02, 2024
On June 25, the return capsule of China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe landed precisely in the designated area in Siziwang banner, north China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, operating normally. The returner brought back samples collected from the moon's far side for the first time in human history, marking another milestone in China's space exploration endeavors.
On December 17, 2020, China's Chang'e-5 probe retrieved about 1,731 grams of samples from the moon - the first ever obtained from a young lunar surface region of volcanic rocks by humankind. Over the past more than three years, the China National Space Administration has distributed 85.48 grams of scientific research samples to 131 research teams in seven batches. More than 70 achievements in multiple fields have been published on important Chinese and foreign journals.

Although the distributed lunar soil samples account for only about five percent of the collected samples, the scientific achievements cover multiple fields such as lunar formation and evolution, space weathering processes and mechanisms, and resource utilization, said an expert. Through the studies of lunar soil, mysteries of the moon are being unveiled.
According to the expert, the samples retrieved by the Chang'e-5 mission were from lunar basaltic rocks, formed when magma from the lunar mantle flowed onto the moon's surface and solidified. They record the secrets of lunar evolution.
The landing site of the Chang'e-5 spacecraft was one of the youngest mare basalts located at a mid-high latitude on the moon. Previous studies estimated the age of the landing site to be between 1 to 3 billion years, but such estimations carried significant uncertainties.
Using a high-resolution dating technique independently developed by China, a Chinese research team dated the youngest rocks on the moon at around 2 billion years in age, meaning that the period of lunar volcanism was about 800 million years longer than previously believed. This finding has also provided a crucial calibration point for the chronology of impact craters, significantly improving the accuracy of dating impact craters on celestial bodies within the inner solar system.
Based on the latest studies on lunar soil, Chinese scientists have proposed new mechanisms for the formation of young volcanoes on the moon and models for lunar thermal evolution, providing new directions and insights for future lunar exploration and research.
Lunar probes and observations over the past decade have suggested that water (OH/H2O) is widely present on the lunar surface, with polar regions having higher concentrations than equatorial regions. Besides, water ice has been found in the polar regions, undergoing dynamic changes based on the duration of sunlight exposure.

However, due to the lack of direct sample analysis, the origin and distribution of lunar water have been a subject of controversy.
Through infrared spectroscopy and nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry, a research team from the Institute of Geochemistry, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has found that lunar soil grains retain a significant amount of solar wind-derived water by studying lunar samples retrieved by the Chang'e-5 mission. According to estimates, solar wind contributed to at least 179 ppm of water content in the lunar samples gathered by the probe.
The research team also found that in the mid-latitude regions of the lunar surface, solar wind has implanted a greater quantity of water in the outer layers of lunar soil particles than previously assumed, while the high-latitude regions of the moon may contain a significant amount of potentially usable water resources. Experts said that this discovery has important implications for the future utilization of lunar water resources.
Helium-3, a potential fuel for nuclear fusion, is believed to be a promising energy source. Scientists estimate that 1 million tons of helium-3 could supply the entire Earth with sufficient clean energy for 10,000 years. It is very scarce on Earth but abundant on the moon.
By analyzing the lunar soil samples retrieved by the Chang'e-5 mission, researchers have determined the optimal temperature parameters for extracting helium-3 from lunar soil. These crucial scientific data provide a foundation for China to estimate the total amount of helium-3 resources on the moon and to explore and develop the energy source in the future.

It is reported that a research team from the Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, has picked out a single-crystal particle with a radius of about 10 microns from more than 140,000 tiny lunar particles retrieved by the Chang'e-5 mission, using X-ray diffraction and other technologies. The team has also decoded the particle's crystal structure.
It has been officially approved as a new mineral by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC) of the International Mineralogical Association (IMA), and named Changesite-(Y), a kind of phosphate mineral in columnar crystal found in lunar basalt particles.
Changesite-(Y) is the sixth new mineral discovered on the moon by humankind. The new finding has made China the third country in the world to have discovered a new mineral on the moon.
According to experts, all 10 lunar sample return missions conducted by humans by far have taken place on the near side of the moon.
The landing site of the Chang'e-6 probe was in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the lunar far side, which is the oldest and largest impact crater on the moon. The collection of samples in this region, a historic milestone for humanity, will enhance humanity's understanding of the lunar origin and the evolution of the solar system.
Researchers said that with the studies on the lunar soil collected by Chang'e-5, they are full of expectations and confidence in studying the samples retrieved during the Chang'e-6 mission.

AI technologies open new prospects for elderly care in China,2024-07-01,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0701/c90000-20187786.html,"Home>>
		
AI technologies open new prospects for elderly care in China
By Wang Aihua (Xinhua) 16:23, July 01, 2024
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yunbo, a 65-year-old resident of Beijing, wholeheartedly embraces his ""smart"" lifestyle.
""When I switch on the TV at home, a personalized list of my favorite channels appears on the screen. The smart band on my wrist displays my daily blood pressure levels and heart rates, reminding me to take my medication. When I take the bus, my mobile phone can automatically identify my location, and the payment code pops up,"" he explained with satisfaction.
For Wang and the nearly 300 million Chinese citizens aged 60 or above, many of whom lack constant companionship and struggle with using electronic devices, AI technologies are increasingly being integrated to simplify and enrich their lives in the digital age.
Official figures show that by the end of 2023, over 490,000 Chinese companies, both state-owned and private, were engaged in elderly care business, focusing primarily on smart health, health-centered tourism, financing, and anti-aging sectors.
Wang Haotian, a researcher at the Academy of Macroeconomic Research under the National Development and Reform Commission, noted that new technologies and business models have emerged in recent years to meet the more personalized, diversified, and quality-focused consumption demands of seniors.
According to the National Health Commission, China is expected to have over 400 million people aged 60 or above by 2033, with the number approaching 500 million by around 2050, accounting for nearly 35 percent of the total population. About 90 percent of this population lives at home, seven percent rely on community support, and the remaining rely on commercial institutions for daily care. Thus, meeting the demands of those living at home is a priority.
Feng Wenmeng, a researcher with the Development Research Center of the State Council, said new smart and digital technologies have created more specialized, secure, and comfortable products for seniors. These include devices that monitor health conditions, shoes with positioning systems, and clothes with built-in sensors and inflatable airbags that deploy upon detecting a fall, cushioning the impact and reducing the risk of injury.
A Shanghai resident surnamed Liu, in her seventies, has even developed a bond with her robot ""nanny."" She talks to the robot every day and relies on its help for housework and health advice. ""I almost can't live without it now,"" she said.
However, experts point out that Chinese companies currently apply AI technologies primarily to basic elderly care services, not yet effectively meeting diverse needs such as remote medical services, leaving significant room for further development.
Last year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, along with 16 other government departments, issued an action plan to further incorporate robots into various elderly care scenarios to enhance the intelligence level of these services.
Experts foresee deeper integration of AI technologies in the coming years, particularly in smart household products, wearable devices, and robots, using 5G, big data, cloud computing and other advanced techniques to achieve higher accuracy and interaction between humans and robots.
The Bank of Shanghai, the largest agency for pension payment in the city, partnered with SenseTime, a leading AI software company, to develop lifelike AI employees offering voice services on its mobile app. This initiative followed feedback that many mobile banking users still had to visit branches due to technical difficulties. With this service, an 82-year-old user, surnamed Xu, found out his pension account balance on his phone by following the voice directions of the AI employees.
The International Telecommunication Union recently selected this case among the first batch of 40 ""AI for Good"" cases worldwide. SenseTime plans to further optimize the AI employees by enhancing their emotional responses and adjusting their images to be more compatible with different phone models.
However, as the elderly care industry rapidly grows with increased AI presence, concerns have arisen. Some seniors find AI products too expensive and sometimes unreliable, while their families worry about privacy infringement and fraud risks targeting vulnerable groups.
Hu Zuquan, a researcher with the State Information Center, suggested that China could learn from the experience of countries like the Netherlands, Japan, and the United Kingdom in developing its gray hair economy with the help of AI.
Justine Coulson, the United Nations Population Fund representative to China, expressed hope that China's exploration of the gray hair economy in the coming decade would serve as valuable examples for other emerging economies.

China's Chang'e-6 mission achieves complete success,2024-07-01,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0701/c90000-20187686.html,"Home>>
		
China's Chang'e-6 mission achieves complete success
By Yu Sinan, Liu Shiyao (People's Daily) 14:52, July 01, 2024
On June 25, the return capsule of China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe landed precisely in the designated area in Siziwang banner, north China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, operating normally. It marked a complete success of the mission.
After its launch, the Chang'e-6 mission went through 11 flight stages in 53 days. It made key-technology breakthroughs in such areas as lunar retrograde orbit design and flight control, intelligent and rapid sampling, and takeoff and ascent from the far side of the moon. It also brought back samples collected from the moon's far side for the first time in human history, marking another milestone in China's space exploration endeavors.

What guaranteed the safe return of the Chang'e-6 probe was a series of technologies.
A researcher with the China Academy of Space Technology said that the return capsule of the Chang'e-6 travels at a very high speed from the moon to Earth. During the return process, it is necessary to moderate the deceleration of the capsule and ensure it exits the atmosphere at a specific location.
To this end, researchers conducted a large number of flight simulations and modeled millions of flight paths to refine the guidance, navigation, and control system. This ensured a smooth process and high precision in the return.
In addition to deceleration, the return capsule of the Chang'e-6 also had to tackle the challenge brought by high temperatures.
According to the researcher, despite its small size, the return capsule is exposed to high temperatures due to its fast entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
To ensure that the return capsule is resistant to both heat and erosion, the development team tailored a ""super protective suit"" for the capsule, drawing on the experience of the Chang'e-5 mission.
As planned, after the necessary ground processing work was completed, the recovered Chang'e-6 returner was airlifted to Beijing to extract sample containers and payload. The samples were handed over to the Chinese research teams at a ceremony held by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The researchers will carry out the storage and processing of the lunar samples as planned and initiate scientific research work.
Following its contribution to the Chang'e-6 mission, the Queqiao-2 relay satellite will choose appropriate times to carry out scientific detection work. Its payloads, including an extreme ultraviolet camera, an array neutral atom imager and an Earth-moon very long baseline interferometry experiment system, will collect scientific data from the moon and deep space.
The Chang'e-6 mission carried four international payloads, including the lunar surface negative ion analyzer of the European Space Agency, France's lunar radon detector, Italy's laser retro-reflector, and a cube satellite from Pakistan. China has received high recognition from the international community for its practical and effective international cooperation.
Zhang Kejian, head of the CNSA, said that exploring the vast universe is a common dream for all of humanity, and only open cooperation is the right path. China's space endeavors will adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, peaceful utilization, and inclusive development.
""We will continue to embrace openness and expand international cooperation channels. We will organize and carry out future major projects and missions, striving to expand human understanding and improve the well-being of humanity,"" he added.

A new domestically designed and manufactured large liquid-propellent reusable rocket model failed its maiden test flight and fell into the mountain area in Gongyi, Central China’s Henan Province, on Sunday, reportedly causing no casualties as of Sunday evening as nearby residents had been evacuated before the flight.
Videos posted online by local residents showed a rocket emitting black smoke before falling into the mountain and catching fire on Sunday afternoon.
According to media reports, the fallen rocket was related to the rocket test conducted by Space Pioneer, a Chinese private rocket company founded in 2019.
In March, the company revealed the maiden flight scheduled for its new large liquid-propellent reusable rocket model TL-3, also known as the Chinese “Falcon 9 equivalent” for its matching powerful design.
The videos uploaded online show that a cylindrical object on fire traced a parabola through the sky before crashing onto the ground, immediately followed by the sound of a huge explosion.
The city’s emergency management bureau said the explosion caused no casualties as of Sunday afternoon, according to Jimu News.
A local villager told Jimu News that the launch site was just 500 meters away from her home. Local authorities had evacuated all the nearby residents as of 10 am on Sunday morning and the residents had to wait for further notice about the time for their return.
Space Pioneer issued a statement on Sunday afternoon, explaining the condition of the test flight of its new large liquid-propellent reusable rocket model TL-3 carried out on Sunday afternoon, according to cls.cn.
During the test flight, a first-stage rocket ignited normally. However, due to structural failure at the connection point between the rocket body and the test stand, the rocket crashed in the deep mountains 1.5 kilometers southwest of the test pad, where the rocket body disintegrated upon impact.
Specially designed for China’s low-orbit satellite internet constellation construction, the TL-3 rocket has a diameter of 3.8 meters, a total length of 71 meters, and a liftoff mass of 590 tons. It is capable of sending a payload of 17 tons to the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 14 tons to the sun-synchronous orbit, according to the company.
The test flight of the rocket with a nine-engine parallel configuration is the most powerful propulsion system of China’s current carrier rocket, two times the previous maximum thrust test in China’s aerospace.
The company promised to quickly rectify the fault and organize the production and testing of new products.

Feature: Chinese scientists tackle Arctic grit for global answers
 (Xinhua) 08:52, July 01, 2024
NY-ALESUND, Norway, June 30 (Xinhua) -- In 1963, French geologist Jean Corbel established a small hut near Ny-Alesund, sparking modern research in Svalbard. Since then, the former mining town has evolved into a global center for science, attracting countries like China to its Arctic research efforts.
""It was a very fine event,"" recalled Kim Holmen, special advisor at the Norwegian Polar Institute, reflecting on the founding ceremony of China's inaugural Arctic research station.
What struck Holmen most deeply, however, were the discussions centered on ""the science that we would be able to pursue.""
China's Arctic Yellow River Station is located on the far east side of the town.
According to Hu Zhengyi, the current manager of the station, the institute mainly serves as a support for China's scientific monitoring and research work in various specialties, including glaciology, terrestrial ecology, marine ecology, space physics, and atmospheric studies.
Hu had been focusing on the study of glaciers since his postgraduate period. The second year after graduation in 2015, he was dispatched to the Station for his first term, spending dozens of days almost every year there.
Hu's research centers on meticulously tracking glacial dynamics, including area and thickness fluctuations, as well as the recession of glacial termini from the coastline, which are all crucial metrics in understanding the impacts of climate change.
Glaciology is a young and relatively niche major in China, Hu said, adding that choosing this major normally means that one would be working far from home, sometimes even a quite backbreaking job.
What he meant was the field research work on glaciers, trudging across the frigid ice while carrying equipment weighing dozens of kilograms.
""This job is not for everyone,"" he joked about the workload.
The Chinese station has been carrying out field research on glaciers for over 10 years, including monitoring and research on glacier material balance, movement, temperature, end position, and meteorology.
Such studies help reveal the response of Arctic glaciers to global warming and provide an important basis for predicting future sea level rise, Hu said.
Basically, most of the research done here is related to climate change, Hu said.
Apart from glacier studies, other research on the changes in terrestrial ecosystems, as well as studies on marine life, also contribute to a better understanding of the common challenges faced by humanity.
By gathering critical data on the health of Arctic ecosystems, the research efforts could contribute to developing better conservation measures.
""The problems we have in front of us are so big that none of us, regardless of how clever we are, could do it alone,"" Holmen said, stressing the significance of more scientific cooperation between different countries.
Currently, scientists from over 10 countries are based in the town to carry out research in the Arctic.
Holmen said this is a research town where scientists from all over the world could meet, make friends, and build trust, which is essential for dealing with global issues.
""I believe it can make a difference in the world,"" he said.

Competition is heating up the fast-developing field of generative artificial intelligence, a cutting-edge disruptive technology that is expected to be increasingly applied to a wider range of sectors and spearhead a new round of industrial transformation and upgrade, domain experts said.
Chinese technology companies, they said, should step up investment in improving computing power and algorithms and accumulate more high-quality training data, so as to gain an edge in the global AI race and narrow the gap with the United States in the latest tech frontier.
Generative AI refers to computer algorithms trained with huge amounts of data capable of generating content such as images, text, audio, and video in a human-like fashion. It is the key technology underpinning US-based research firm OpenAI's ChatGPT.
The recent launch of GPT-4o, the latest large language model or LLM developed by OpenAI, has caused a global sensation. The new flagship generative AI model surpasses the company's existing models in visual and audio understanding, making the interaction between humans and machines much more natural and easier.
LLMs are AI models fed with huge amounts of text data for use in a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to machine translation.
Industry insiders said the multimodal LLMs, which possess the ability to process and generate content across multiple modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, will lead the way for the further development of the generative AI industry, with significant potential for application in various industries like finance, retail, healthcare, and intelligent manufacturing.
According to a report from global consultancy McKinsey &Co, generative AI will add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in annual value to the global economy, enhancing all sectors of industry. Banking, high technology, and life sciences are among the industries that could see the biggest impact from generative AI.
Major Chinese tech heavyweights, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc, iFlytek, and Tencent Holdings Ltd, are scrambling to roll out their own AI-powered LLMs and bolster the commercial use of generative AI technology.
In May, Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, unveiled Tongyi Qianwen 2.5, the latest version of its LLM, saying its capabilities have surpassed those of OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model, the predecessor of GPT-4o.
The Tongyi Qianwen 2.5 achieved a full upgrade with improved performance in reasoning, code comprehension, and textual understanding compared with the previous version, the company said.
In the context of the Chinese language, the new model has caught up with the GPT-4 model in terms of text understanding and generation, knowledge quiz, dialogues, and life advice, said Zhou Jingren, chief technology officer of Alibaba Cloud.
Alibaba's LLMs have been deployed by over 90,000 enterprise users in industries like consumer electronics, automobiles, education, healthcare, culture, tourism, and gaming.
""We look forward to collaborating with our customers and developers in seizing the immense growth opportunities presented by the latest surge in generative artificial intelligence technology,"" Zhou said, adding Alibaba Cloud will continue to contribute a diverse array of AI models to the open-source communities.
Official data showed that the Chinese self-developed LLMs rank second in the world, and over 100 LLMs with more than 1 billion parameters each have been launched in China.

Baidu said in April its LLM and ChatGPT-like chatbot Ernie Bot had garnered more than 200 million users since its debut in March 2023, while more than 85,000 enterprise clients had used Baidu's enterprise-level LLM platform Qianfan to create 190,000 AI applications.
Robin Li, co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Baidu, said the multimodal LLMs are key to the future development of AI technology, and this approach has been largely regarded as essential for realizing artificial general intelligence or AGI, which is a theoretical AI system with capabilities that rival those of a human.
He emphasized the biggest difference between China and some Western countries in terms of AI lies in applications, which are driving the rapid development of the AI industry in China.
Li said in the United States and Europe, everyone is trying to come up with cutting-edge foundation models. ""In China, although there are hundreds of foundation models, people are increasingly talking about what the super app is for the AI age, or what is the killer app or the AI native app,"" he noted. ""We take more of an application-driven approach.
""More people probably are focused on when GPT-5 will likely emerge, and what kind of new features we will be offering, but I'm more interested in what kind of application can take full advantage of the existing power of large language models.""
The Ernie 4.0, Baidu's latest LLM, is better than the GPT-4 in Chinese because the company used a lot more Chinese data to train that model, Li said.
Chinese AI company iFlytek announced in January that its upgraded LLM outperformed GPT-4 Turbo in metrics like language understanding and math. For its part, e-commerce giant JD unveiled its LLM, the ChatRhino, which could be used in various fields, including retail, logistics, finance, and health, as the company aims to bolster digital transformation and upgrade industries by using AI.
Wang Peng, a researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said, ""China's major advantages in developing AI lie in abundant data resources and diversified industrial application scenarios, while the US has taken the lead in basic AI research, chips, algorithms and other crucial technologies, as well as a sound innovation ecosystem.""
Chinese enterprises should pool more resources to improve the quality of data that satisfies the training of LLMs, optimize algorithms, cultivate talent specialized in the field of AI, and expand cooperation with leading international AI companies, Wang said.
Lu Yanxia, research director at market research company International Data Corp China, said Chinese tech companies' continuous technological advancements in LLMs will further promote the popularization of AI models, and bring fresh business opportunities for domestic AI servers, cloud computing, and chip companies.
She said tech enterprises should pool more resources to improve computing power, algorithms, and quality of data to narrow the gap with the US in the generative AI sector.
The LLMs necessitate higher demand for data and knowledge in professional fields, and for talent that can fine-tune specialized models based on diverse industrial demands, she said.
As various industries adopt the latest wave of digital transformation driven by AI, China's spending on information and communications technology will increase by 9.8 percent year-on-year in 2024, surpassing the global average by two percentage points, IDC said.
Pan Helin, a member of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's Expert Committee for Information and Communication Economy, said the training of multimodal AI models necessitates massive requirements for computing capacity resources, which will give a strong boost to the development of the computing power industry.
""Chinese tech companies should beef up independent innovation abilities in underlying computing power chips and programming software, and invest more in basic scientific research, including mathematics, statistics, and computer science, in order to catch up with leading foreign counterparts amid intensifying competition in the global AI industry,"" Pan said.
According to a report released by global consultancy Accenture, about 85 percent of Chinese business leaders plan to increase investments in generative AI this year, while 73 percent of Chinese company executives are prioritizing investments in strengthening their organizations' digital core capacities, including cloud, AI, platforms, and security.
The report stated that 93 percent of surveyed executives in China agree that the way they interact with data will change, from searching for information to asking questions and receiving direct advice and responses. The research surveyed 2,800 company executives, including 225 from China, between February and March.
Accenture also found as much as 40 percent of all working hours will be supported or augmented by language-based AI, and generative AI has the potential to enable productivity enhancements across 900 different types of jobs.
Joyce Yi, managing director and operations delivery lead of Accenture Greater China, said Chinese enterprises are more willing to spend money on sales and product development in the process of AI applications, while their investments in enterprise operations are relatively less.
Although AI brings about new development opportunities, challenges still remain, experts said and called for efforts to ensure the safe and reliable application of intelligent technology through global governance.
Zeng Yi, a researcher at the Institute of Automation, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the management and governance of risks brought by AI are becoming increasingly important.
The responsible and appropriate use of AI and driving its steady development will allow this technology to be beneficial to all humans, Zeng said.
More efforts are needed to strengthen international cooperation in promoting the sustainable development of AI, and establish a global AI development and governance institution under the framework of the United Nations, he said.

WENCHANG, Hainan, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's first commercial spacecraft launch site is ready for operations in south China's Hainan Province as of Sunday, having completed a rocket launch simulation rehearsal using its two launch pads.
According to the Hainan International Commercial Aerospace Launch Co., Ltd. (HICAL), which built and operates the launch site, the exercises performed using the launch pads included water spraying and deluge system cooling, as well as a rocket lifting arm erection test.
Following assessments, HICAL confirmed that the site is operational for launch missions.
HICAL President Yang Tianliang called on the company to work with satellite and rocket developers, and to prepare for the site's first launch mission.
Established in June 2022, HICAL was founded by the Hainan provincial government, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, and the China Satellite Network Group Co., Ltd.
The launch site has an approximate investment of 4 billion yuan (about 560 million U.S. dollars) and is located off the coast of Wenchang City. It includes a launch area, a TT&C (telemetry, tracking and command) building, multiple rocket assembly buildings, spacecraft testing and integration facilities, fuel storage facilities, and other structures.
It is positioned at a latitude of 20 degrees north, benefitting from the advantages of a low latitude, which increases rocket payload capacities and reduces launch costs.
Compared to inland launch sites, coastal launch sites are more convenient and safer as large rockets can transported to site by ship, which is very important for commercial launch services. A new, purpose-built port is being planned by the Hainan provincial government.
The coastal location also gives HICAL an advantage in its recovery of reusable rockets after launch. The company is working with commercial rocket developers to carry out experiments related to vertical landings and the recovery of rockets from the sea.
It said the launch site is designed with two launch pads for liquid propellant rockets and another two for solid propellant rockets, with its No.1 and No.2 launch pads completed in December 2023 and June 2024, respectively.
The No.1 pad is designed for the Long March-8, China's new generation medium-lift carrier rocket. The No.2 pad is capable of launching multiple types of rockets with various diameters from commercial rocket companies. Each pad has an annual capacity of 16 launches.
The propellant and gas supply system at the launch site is capable of refueling and supplying liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, kerosene and methane.
HICAL will also support commercial rocket companies in providing international commercial launch services. Xiang Dalin, vice director of HICAL's technical department, said the company will issue a universal interface file of commercial rocket designs both domestically and internationally.
The commercial space industry was included in the Chinese government work report for the first time this year. It was listed as one of the ""emerging industries and future-oriented industries"" that the government plans to cultivate.
According to the 2023 China aerospace science and technology blue book, the country completed 26 commercial launches in 2023, accounting for 39 percent of its total number of launches.
China's commercial space market has maintained rapid growth since 2015, with an average annual growth rate of more than 20 percent from 2017 to 2024. It is estimated that its market value will be about 2.34 trillion yuan by 2024.

BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Upon the complete success of the Chang'e-6 mission, which brought back the world's first samples from the far side of the moon, President Xi Jinping promptly extended his congratulations.
""The outstanding contributions you have made will always be remembered by the country and the people,"" Xi told all those who participated in the mission in a congratulatory message.
Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has always kept the country's lunar exploration endeavors in his mind.
It is a tradition for the president to extend congratulations upon the success of each Chang'e mission.
He also met representatives of space scientists and engineers who participated in the Chang'e-3, Chang'e-4 and Chang'e-5 missions, inquired about their work and life and took pictures with them.
For three consecutive years from 2019 to 2021, Xi highlighted the lunar exploration achievements in his New Year speech.
""Great undertakings are based on innovation, which is crucial for our future,"" Xi said in February 2019 when meeting representatives of space scientists and engineers who participated in the research and development of the Chang'e-4 mission.
Living up to Xi's expectations, China's researchers and engineers have taken a self-reliant and ingenious path in the lunar exploration program.
Chang'e-4 made history by being the first mission to achieve soft landing on the far side of the moon. Its rover Yutu-2 started roaming and conducting surveys on this rarely-explored terrain in 2019, leaving moving human trails on the far side of the moon for the first time.
Chang'e-5, launched in 2020, was China's first mission to collect and return lunar samples to Earth. Unlike sampling missions of the United States and the Soviet Union, China chose a complicated technological approach including unmanned rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit, which could bring back more samples and lay a technological foundation for manned lunar missions.
Based on the experience of Chang'e-5, Chang'e-6 made further innovations by collecting and returning lunar samples from the moon's far side, an unprecedented feat in human lunar exploration history.
""We must be bold in our pursuit of innovation, acquire core technologies, strive to be the backbone of the country's aerospace industry, and scale new heights in space science and technology,"" said Xiong Tianci, a young designer with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, developer of the Long March-5 carrier rockets that sent Chang'e-5 and Chang'e-6 into space.
Noting that exploring the vast universe is humanity's common dream, Xi has stressed the importance of conducting international space cooperation and making contributions to the well-being of all mankind.
China's lunar exploration program stands as evidence of the country's consistent promotion of international cooperation in the field of space exploration.
China welcomes international applications for the lunar samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 and Chang'e-6 missions for scientific researches. Scientists from countries such as Australia, Russia, France, the United States, Britain, and Sweden have taken part in the research of the Chang'e-5 lunar samples.
Chang'e-6 has carried four international payloads, respectively from the European Space Agency (ESA), France, Italy, and Pakistan. Chang'e-7 will carry six international scientific instruments, and Chang'e-8 will offer 200 kilograms of international payload capacity and has garnered over 30 applications.
Xi's guidance and concern on the lunar exploration program has inspired numerous scientists and engineers, who are committed to advancing major space projects, including deep space exploration, and enhancing international exchanges and cooperation.
""We will continue to foster independent innovation capabilities and improve the independent innovation system, so as to propel bigger and further steps in space exploration,"" said Zhang Gao, an expert involved in the development of the Chang'e-6 probe from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.

BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Chang'e-6 mission collected 1,935.3 grams of samples from the far side of the moon, preliminary measurement by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) showed Friday.
Zhang Kejian, head of the CNSA, handed over the sample container and sample certificate to Ding Chibiao, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), at a ceremony in Beijing.
Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong presided over the handover ceremony.
""We have found that the samples brought back by Chang'e-6 were more viscous compared to previous samples, with the presence of clumps. These are observable characteristics,"" Ge Ping, deputy director of the CNSA's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center, who is also the spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission, told the press at the ceremony.
Researchers will then store and process the lunar samples as planned and initiate scientific research.
The lunar samples, which were collected from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history, hold unique scientific significance as they will further enhance the understanding of lunar evolution, accelerate the pace of peaceful exploration and utilization of lunar resources, and serve as an important asset for all humanity, the CNSA said.
The CNSA vowed to uphold the spirit of lunar exploration, characterized by ""chasing dreams, daring to explore, collaborating to overcome challenges, and achieving win-win cooperation,"" to ensure the proper management of the samples.
The CNSA said it will organize scientific research on the samples and share China's lunar exploration achievements with the international community.
Based on the lunar sample management rules released by the CNSA and the experience in dealing with the applications for lunar samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission, applications for the Chang'e-6 samples are expected to open to domestic research institutions and scientists in about six months, Ge said.
Regarding international applications, Ge noted that China has always maintained a positive and open attitude and welcomes scientists from all countries to submit applications following relevant procedures.
Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, attended the handover ceremony.
Zhang stressed that the lunar samples be well managed and elaborate scientific research carried out to produce a number of world-class original scientific results, making new achievements in exploring the mysteries of the universe and enhancing the well-being of humanity.
Zhang added that China will continuously strengthen international cooperation in space missions, boost the innovative development of space science, technology, and applications, and promote the coordinated development of commercial and traditional space activities.
Later on Friday, Ding Chibiao handed the lunar samples to the National Astronomical Observatories under the CAS (NAOC).
""We will handle the samples with utmost care and ensure they are safely unsealed, scientifically processed, properly stored, and distributed according to the established management protocols,"" said Liu Jifeng, director of the NAOC.
""The sampling site of the Chang'e-6 mission is in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin, which is a gigantic impact crater. This presents an exceptional opportunity for us to gain insights into the early impact processes on the moon, thereby contributing to our understanding of the early evolution history of the solar system,"" Liu said.
""The scientific significance of the lunar samples is immense. We will organize scientists to conduct meticulous research, ensuring that not even the tiniest amount of the samples is wasted, to fully explore their profound scientific value,"" he added.
Previously, significant scientific achievements have been made through in-depth research on the lunar samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission in areas such as lunar formation and evolution, space weathering, and resource utilization, the CNSA said.
Researchers have published more than 80 achievements in important domestic and international journals, including the discovery of the new lunar mineral Changesite-(Y), the sixth discovered on the moon, and the ""youngest"" basalt on the moon, which was determined to be about two billion years old and extended the ""life"" of lunar volcanism 800-900 million years longer than previously known.
The Chang'e-6 probe was launched into orbit on May 3. On June 25, its returner, carrying the lunar samples, landed precisely in its designated area in Siziwang Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, marking the mission's complete success.
The Chang'e-6 returner safely arrived in Beijing later. Researchers opened it and successfully collected the lunar sample container on Wednesday, according to the CNSA.

Zhang Kejian, head of the CNSA, handed over the sample container and sample certificate to Ding Chibiao, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), at a ceremony in Beijing.
Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong presided over the handover ceremony.
""We have found that the samples brought back by Chang'e-6 were more viscous compared to previous samples, with the presence of clumps. These are observable characteristics,"" Ge Ping, deputy director of the CNSA's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center, who is also the spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission, told the press at the ceremony.
Researchers will then store and process the lunar samples as planned and initiate scientific research.
The lunar samples, which were collected from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history, hold unique scientific significance as they will further enhance the understanding of lunar evolution, accelerate the pace of peaceful exploration and utilization of lunar resources, and serve as an important asset for all humanity, the CNSA said.
The CNSA vowed to uphold the spirit of lunar exploration, characterized by ""chasing dreams, daring to explore, collaborating to overcome challenges, and achieving win-win cooperation,"" to ensure the proper management of the samples.
The CNSA said it will organize scientific research on the samples and share China's lunar exploration achievements with the international community.
Based on the lunar sample management rules released by the CNSA and the experience in dealing with the applications for lunar samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission, applications for the Chang'e-6 samples are expected to open to domestic research institutions and scientists in about six months, Ge said.
Regarding international applications, Ge noted that China has always maintained a positive and open attitude and welcomes scientists from all countries to submit applications following relevant procedures.
Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, attended the handover ceremony.
Zhang stressed that the lunar samples be well managed and elaborate scientific research carried out to produce a number of world-class original scientific results, making new achievements in exploring the mysteries of the universe and enhancing the well-being of humanity.
Zhang added that China will continuously strengthen international cooperation in space missions, boost the innovative development of space science, technology, and applications, and promote the coordinated development of commercial and traditional space activities.
Later on Friday, Ding Chibiao handed the lunar samples to the National Astronomical Observatories under the CAS (NAOC).
""We will handle the samples with utmost care and ensure they are safely unsealed, scientifically processed, properly stored, and distributed according to the established management protocols,"" said Liu Jifeng, director of the NAOC.
""The sampling site of the Chang'e-6 mission is in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin, which is a gigantic impact crater. This presents an exceptional opportunity for us to gain insights into the early impact processes on the moon, thereby contributing to our understanding of the early evolution history of the solar system,"" Liu said.
""The scientific significance of the lunar samples is immense. We will organize scientists to conduct meticulous research, ensuring that not even the tiniest amount of the samples is wasted, to fully explore their profound scientific value,"" he added.
Previously, significant scientific achievements have been made through in-depth research on the lunar samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission in areas such as lunar formation and evolution, space weathering, and resource utilization, the CNSA said.
Researchers have published more than 80 achievements in important domestic and international journals, including the discovery of the new lunar mineral Changesite-(Y), the sixth discovered on the moon, and the ""youngest"" basalt on the moon, which was determined to be about two billion years old and extended the ""life"" of lunar volcanism 800-900 million years longer than previously known.
The Chang'e-6 probe was launched into orbit on May 3. On June 25, its returner, carrying the lunar samples, landed precisely in its designated area in Siziwang Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, marking the mission's complete success.
The Chang'e-6 returner safely arrived in Beijing later. Researchers opened it and successfully collected the lunar sample container on Wednesday, according to the CNSA.

"""Science and technology backyards"" propel rural revitalization in NE China's Jilin",2024-06-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0628/c90000-20186929.html,"Home>>
		
""Science and technology backyards"" propel rural revitalization in NE China's Jilin
 (People's Daily Online) 11:09, June 28, 2024
""This is the first rice-fishing farming science and technology backyard (STB) in China,"" said Wang Qiuju, a supervisor of a master's degree program at Jilin Agricultural University in northeast China's Jilin Province.
Wang is also the chief expert of the Gongzhuling rice-fishing farming STB in Nanwaizi village, Gongzhuling city, Jilin Province. In 2022, the STB was honored by the China Rural Special Technology Association.

The province boasts of 105 nationally recognized STBs, ranking first in the country, said Chen Yaohui, vice chairman of the Jilin provincial science and technology association.
These STBs are contributing to all-round rural revitalization in the province.
""Under harsh conditions, our university's teachers and students addressed agricultural 'bottleneck' issues faced by farmers,"" said Zhang Dianfeng, Party head of Jilin Agricultural University, in front of the former site of the Gongzhuling rice-fishing farming STB.
In the summer of 2023, Wang, her husband Wu Min, who is also a teacher from the university, and their postgraduates moved to the new site of the STB with better conditions about 100 meters away from the former site.
The new STB boasts improved research conditions, Wang said, adding that an experimental field, which is the ""main battlefield"" of her team, is just at the doorstep of the STB.
In 2018, Wang and her team arrived in Nanwaizi village to develop techniques for cultivating crayfish and crabs in rice fields. Farming crayfish or crabs in rice fields helps farmers boost their income and can be economically beneficial, according to Wang.

Every year, just before the start of the rice planting season, Wang and her husband would lead their students to the village and stay for more than half a year.
Zhao Chunyu, a farmer in the village, provided land for Wang and other researchers from Jilin Agricultural University for experiments, becoming the first to ""take the plunge"" in the village.
At first, local residents were skeptical of Wang's team, as they hadn't seen any tangible benefits. Zhao was initially apprehensive, too. ""After all, we've been farming for so many years, but no one had ever tried raising crabs in rice fields before,"" Zhao recalled.

In 2020, Zhao and other members of an aquaculture farmers' cooperative volunteered to feed the crabs, as Wang was pregnant. That year, their collective efforts paid off, resulting in a bumper harvest of both rice and crabs for the cooperative.
One year later, the Jilin provincial science and technology association and Jilin Agricultural University took the lead in establishing the Gongzhuling rice-fishing farming STB in Nanwaizi village. It became one of the first eight STBs recognized by the province, and Wang served as the chief expert of the STB.
The success didn't come easily. After years of experimentation, Wang and her team successfully developed a model for rice cultivation combined with crayfish and crab farming. They devised a technique that significantly improved the survival rate of baby crayfish in Jilin Province and developed special feed for crabs in paddy fields. Thanks to the tailored feed, a crab in paddy fields can now grow to around 100 grams, a significant increase from about 50 grams in the past.

The new model also increases the yield of rice. In 2023, the rice yield of experimental fields exceeded 550 kilograms per mu (667 square meters).
According to Zhao, rice would sell for 5.2 yuan ($0.72) to 5.4 yuan per kilogram previously, but now it can be sold for 10 yuan per kilogram, as rice-crab farming reduces the use of pesticides and fertilizers and leads to better rice quality. Meanwhile, the yield of crabs in each mu of rice field reaches about 15 kilograms. The mixed rice-crab farming increases profits by 300 yuan to 500 yuan per mu.
The STB's innovative farming model has attracted more and more households. The cooperative's experimental fields have increased from 10 mu to over 500 mu, and Zhao has become the head of the cooperative.
The Gongzhuling rice-fishing farming STB, deeply rooted in the countryside, not only promotes technological innovation but also contributes to academic advancement.
Jilin Agricultural University requires postgraduates of the STB to stay there for no less than 120 days per year for research, while supervisors and experts guide the students' research work both online and offline and engage in technique development, field guidance, and the promotion of techniques, Zhang said.
In the past five years, a total of 13 papers from teachers and students associated with the STB have been included in the Science Citation Index (SCI). The STB has helped the cooperative register three trademarks.

To extend the STB's reach, Wang created an account on Douyin, a popular short video app platform in China, and often shared videos about baby crayfish bred by the STB, which attracted people who want to buy them across Jilin Province. Wang decided to offer baby crayfish to villagers in many places in the province free of charge.
On June 7, the Jilin provincial crayfish farming promotion conference and popularization day for mixed rice-fishing farming was held at a crayfish farming base in Yitong Manchu Autonomous County, Siping city of Jilin Province. In late May, the industry-education-research demonstration base of Jilin Agricultural University was set up, marking the formal settlement of the province's first and largest breeding base for baby crayfish in cold climates in the county.
These achievements are partly attributed to students from the STB, who have promoted the research results of the STB over the past years, Wang said.
Wang is not alone in implementing the STB program. Wang's husband is the chief expert of the other STB. Jilin Agricultural University's teams run 67 of 105 STBs in Jilin Province.
In recent years, postgraduates of these STBs have applied for 21 patents, published 110 academic articles, held 54 science popularization events, provided technological services for 535,240 mu of land, and promoted 28 new techniques, according to Zhang.
For years, Jilin Province has regarded the establishment of STBs as a crucial measure to accelerate agricultural modernization and promote comprehensive rural revitalization.
The STB program has not only cultivated young researchers but also a large number of ""new farmers."" As of April 2024, STBs in the province had provided 761 training sessions on agricultural technologies both online and offline, and posted 485 science popularization articles and short videos, benefiting over 30,000 households.

A total of 1,935.3 grams of lunar samples were retrieved by China's Chang'e 6 robotic probe from the moon's far side, the China National Space Administration announced on Friday morning, as the space authority handed over the scientifically invaluable substances to scientists.
The weight of the samples, the most asked question by science and space enthusiasts over the past two days, was revealed by the space administration at a handover ceremony at its Beijing headquarters.
Put in a special container, the lunar dust was handed over by Zhang Kejian, head of the space administration, to Ding Chibiao, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, at the ceremony.
After the delivery, the samples will be transported to a lunar sample laboratory in Beijing, where the precious substances will be stored and initially processed, according to the space administration.
The samples, the first materials recovered from the lunar far side, have unique scientific value and will further expand humans' knowledge about the moon's history and help to gear up the exploration and exploitation of lunar resources, the administration said, noting they are ""shared treasure"" of humanity.
The Chang'e 6 mission, representing the world's first attempt to bring samples from the far side of the moon back to Earth, was launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket on May 3 from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province.
The 8.35-ton spacecraft consisted of four components — an orbiter, a lander, an ascender, and a reentry capsule.
After a host of complex, challenging steps, the lander touched down at the South Pole-Aitken Basin, one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system, on the morning of June 2.
The landing marked the second time a spacecraft had ever arrived in the lunar far side.
The vast region had never been reached by any spacecraft until January 2019, when the Chang'e 4 probe landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The Chang'e 4 surveyed areas surrounding its landing site but did not collect and send back samples.
The Chang'e 6 lander worked for 49 hours on the lunar far side, using a mechanical arm and a drill to collect surface and underground materials. Meanwhile, several scientific apparatuses were activated to conduct survey and analysis assignments.
After the tasks were completed, the sample-loaded ascender lifted off from the lunar surface and reached lunar orbit to dock with the reentry capsule to transfer the samples.
In the final leg of the mission, the orbiter and the reentry capsule flew back to Earth orbit before separating above Earth's atmosphere.
The reentry capsule successfully touched down on its preset landing site in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region on Tuesday.

BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Chang'e-6 mission collected 1,935.3 grams of samples from the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced Friday.
Zhang Kejian, head of the CNSA, handed over the sample container to Ding Chibiao, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), along with the sample certificate at a ceremony held in Beijing.
Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong presided over the handover ceremony.
Based on preliminary measurement, the Chang'e-6 mission collected 1,935.3 grams of lunar samples, according to the CNSA.
""We have found that the samples brought back by Chang'e-6 were more viscous compared to previous samples, with the presence of clumps. These are observable characteristics,"" Ge Ping, deputy director of the CNSA's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center, who is also the spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission, told the press at the ceremony.
Researchers will then carry out the storage and processing of the lunar samples as planned and initiate scientific research work.
The lunar samples, which were collected from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history, hold unique scientific significance as they will further enhance the understanding of lunar evolution, accelerate the pace of peaceful exploration and utilization of lunar resources, and serve as an important asset for all humanity, the CNSA said.
The CNSA vowed to continue to uphold the spirit of lunar exploration, characterized by ""chasing dreams, daring to explore, collaborating to overcome challenges, and achieving win-win cooperation,"" to ensure the proper management of the samples.
It will organize scientific research on the samples, sharing China's lunar exploration achievements with the international community, the CNSA said.
Based on the lunar sample management rules released by the CNSA and the experience in dealing with the applications for lunar samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission, applications for the Chang'e-6 samples are expected to open to domestic research institutions and scientists in about six months, Ge said.
Regarding international applications, Ge noted that China has always maintained a positive and open attitude and China welcomes scientists from all countries to submit applications in accordance with relevant procedures.
Previously, significant scientific achievements have been made through in-depth research on the lunar samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission, in areas such as lunar formation and evolution, space weathering, and resource utilization, the CNSA said.
Researchers have published more than 80 achievements in important domestic and international journals, including the discovery of the new lunar mineral Changesite-(Y), the sixth discovered on the moon, and the ""youngest"" basalt on the moon, which was determined to be about two billion years old and extended the ""life"" of lunar volcanism 800-900 million years longer than previously known.
The Chang'e-6 probe was launched into orbit on May 3. Its returner, carrying the lunar samples, landed precisely in its designated area in Siziwang Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on June 25, marking a complete success for the mission.
The Chang'e-6 returner safely arrived in Beijing later. Researchers opened it and successfully collected the lunar sample container on Wednesday, according to the CNSA.

Bian Zhigang, deputy director of the space administration, said on Thursday at a news conference in Beijing that the administration is working on two new lunar expeditions and three deep-space exploration missions.
""We are developing the Chang'e 7 and Chang'e 8 robotic probes. Chang'e 7 will be sent to the lunar South Pole region on the moon to conduct environmental and resources surveys, while Chang'e 8 will undertake technology demonstrations for in-situ resources utilization,"" he told Chinese and foreign journalists attending the news conference, which was hosted by the State Council Information Office.
Bian did not mention when the two lunar probes are scheduled for launch, but information published by the space administration indicates that Chang'e 7 will be launched around 2026 and Chang'e 8 around 2028.
The Chinese government has approved three new deep-space exploration missions to enable scientists to advance their research on the origins and evolution of the solar system, the impacts of small celestial bodies and solar activities on Earth, the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and other such significant scientific issues, according to the senior official.
""The Tianwen 2 will be a robotic mission to retrieve samples from a near-Earth asteroid. It is scheduled for launch next year. Tianwen 3, scheduled for (launch) around 2030, aims to land on Mars, collect and bring samples back to Earth. The Tianwen 4 will be sent to explore Jupiter around 2030,"" Bian said.
Currently, scientists and engineers are working on mission plans and key technologies for Tianwen 3 and Tianwen 4, he added.
Tianwen missions, named after an ancient Chinese poem, cover China's interplanetary exploration endeavors.
The Tianwen 1 was launched in July 2020 and it successfully touched down on Mars in May 2021. The probe deployed a rover, named Zhurong, to explore the Red Planet. Zhurong was the sixth rover on Mars, after five from the United States. It traveled more than 1,900 meters and obtained a great deal of data and images before ceasing operations.
According to mission planners and scientists, Tianwen 2 will target 2016 HO3, the smallest and closest quasi-satellite to Earth. The basic plan is to use a large carrier rocket to send a probe comprising two parts — an orbiter and a reentry module — toward the asteroid.
After approaching 2016 HO3, the unmanned spacecraft will orbit around the asteroid and then fly very close to it to use a mechanical arm to scoop dust from the surface.
Tianwen 2 will fly back to the Earth's orbit and release its reentry module, allowing the latter to fall back to the ground, carrying the samples. The orbiter will then travel toward a main-belt comet called 311P to continue its scientific exploration tasks.
So far, scientists have identified about 1 million asteroids in the solar system, with more than 20,000 traveling near Earth.
The 2016 HO3, also known as 469219 Kamo'oalewa, was first spotted in April 2016 by an asteroid survey telescope at the Haleakala Observatories in Hawaii, the US.
