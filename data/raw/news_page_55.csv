Scientists reveal stone tool technology of East Asian hominins 1.1 mln years ago
 (Xinhua) 09:58, March 07, 2024
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An international research team led by Chinese scientists has found that East Asian hominins had possessed advanced stone tool technology as early as 1.1 million years ago, much earlier than previously thought.
The team, led by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, carried out systematic study on the characteristics of stone tool technology at Cenjiawan site in Nihewan basin, northern China, revealing the earliest prepared core technology in Eurasia.
According to technical analysis and high-precision 3D scanning of stone tools at the site, the research team revealed how hominins at the site made and used stone tools. The results show that prepared core technology had existed at the site.
Prepared core technology is an important part of Acheulean industry, the first standardized tradition of toolmaking of Homo erectus and early Homo sapiens. The research team believes that the hominins at the Cenjiawan site had similar cognitive level and technical ability as the Acheulean hominins.
The study is of great significance to the study of the evolution and innovation of early Paleolithic technology, said Pei Shuwen with the IVPP, one of the corresponding authors of the study.
It shows the great potential of Nihewan basin in the research field of constructing the development model of human evolution and behavior in East Asia for millions of years, Pei said.
The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).

BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The meteorological satellite, Fengyun-4B (FY-4B), has succeeded FY-4A and resumed its operations on Tuesday after almost a month of drift and adjustment, according to China Meteorological Administration.
FY-4B started drifting from 133 degrees east longitude on Feb. 1 this year, and arrived at the geostationary orbit at 105 degrees east longitude on Feb. 19. The scope monitored by FY-4B has moved further westward after its orbit was adjusted, enabling it to better serve more Belt and Road countries.
FY-4B is currently in its optimal state with the well-operated satellite-Earth system and the optimized technical performance, said Zheng Xudong, an official with the National Satellite Meteorological Center.
He said that it can achieve a temporal-spatial resolution of 250 meters within one minute, providing more powerful technical supports for disastrous weather monitoring and forecasting.
Next, FY-4A and its ground system will keep operating while its work intensity will be gradually reduced, he added.
FY-4B was launched by a Long March-3B rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan Province on June 3, 2021. It has formed a network with FY-4A, which was launched into space in Dec. 2016, to provide more accurate and faster weather data.

The planning of large-scale scientific facilities and basic research requires long-term perspective and more investment, said Wang Yifang, director of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), who is also a deputy to the 14th National People's Congress.
China has made remarkable achievements in the construction of large-scale scientific facilities after decades of development. If all projects planned in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) are completed, China will have approximately 70 large scientific facilities, a number comparable to that of the US, Wang told the Global Times.
However, there is still a significant gap in terms of the investment scale for individual facility and the total investment scale compared to the US. Currently, China still lacks internationally leading specialized large scientific facilities, especially in the fields of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astronomy, he stressed.
""This puts us at a disadvantage compared to some other countries in certain areas, such as astronomical telescopes and particle accelerators. Therefore, I believe that in the future, we should focus on improving the quality of development rather than increasing the quantity of large scientific facilities in order to compete directly with advanced countries and strive to surpass them,"" Wang said.
""Without large scientific facilities, basic research would be just an idea on paper. We mustn't always be a recipient of knowledge, but should grow into a provider of knowledge and leader in global basic research,"" Wang said.
China has been paying more attention to strengthening basic research, as it is not only a cornerstone for achieving greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, but the foundation for solving many bottleneck technologies. In the face of fierce international scientific and technological competition, Wang stressed that increasing funding for basic scientific research is a priority.
According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2022, the country's investment in basic research accounted for 6.57 percent of total research and development (R&D) spending, while the goal according to the 14th Five-Year Plan is 8 percent by 2025, which Wang said requires more efforts to realize.
Taking the construction of China's Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) as an example, we have to be clear that the construction period for the CEPC is 10 years. If we do not start now, China will lag behind others in this field in 10 years' time, Wang said.
The CEPC is a large international scientific facility proposed by the Chinese particle physics community in 2012. The goal of the project is to build a high-luminosity Higgs factory to explore unknown areas in the field of particle physics, according to the CAS.
The CEPC's ""Technical Design Report"" has gone through international review and was officially published in December, 2023. Being able to independently design such a large scientific facility demonstrates Chinese scientists' capabilities, according to Wang.

Political advisor proposes establishing national team to address China's supercomputing bottleneck,2024-03-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0306/c90000-20141359.html,"Home>>
		
Political advisor proposes establishing national team to address China's supercomputing bottleneck
By Liu Caiyu and Zhao Juecheng (Global Times) 14:23, March 06, 2024
China should establish a national team to address the country's supercomputing bottleneck, a political advisor told the Global Times on Tuesday. He said he believed this initiative is crucial for China to achieve sovereign Artificial Intelligence (AI) development.
Zhang Yunquan, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, also a research fellow from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said China's innovation and supply of domestically produced intelligent computing chips for large model training is currently lagging behind, compared to that of the US.
Zhang wrote in his proposal that domestic AI chip manufacturers in China are limited in their ability to produce cutting-edge chips due to constraints on semiconductor producing and being placed on the US entity list.
Domestic chip manufacturers have to either start from scratch or be forced to be compatible with Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). In the long run, China's chip development would be still subject to restrictions and legal risks, Zhang said, bringing up the challenges facing domestic chip manufacturers.
Zhang proposed establishing special supercomputing research projects, including chips project, with the national strength.
China is able to fully utilize the talent and technological advantages accumulated in the field of supercomputing, so as to quickly make breakthroughs, and narrow the gap between China and the US in the field of sovereignty-based large model training as soon as possible, Zhang noted.
Sovereign AI capabilities can affect the entire country's technological competitiveness, including military, political, economic, and other aspects, in the international community. If we fall behind in this regard, we may face the risk of being sanctioned and suppressed, Zhang noted.
Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks, according to Nvidia.
To achieve a rapid breakthrough in sovereign AI capabilities, Zhang stressed that the issue must be addressed at a national level, by fully coordinating various forces and forming a national team.
The special national team can be composed of leading authoritative experts in the industry and major AI chip manufacturers, and can work to develop domestically produced chips, software, and systems for large-scale model training that can compete with high-end training GPUs from Nvidia.
With their efforts, national standards and the best chip development technology route used for sovereign AI training can be determined, Zhang noted.

China accelerates building of new quality productive forces,2024-03-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0306/c90000-20141255.html,"Home>>
		
China accelerates building of new quality productive forces
By Yang Junfeng (People's Daily) 10:27, March 06, 2024
China will strive to modernize the industrial system and develop new quality productive forces at a faster pace, according to a government work report submitted on March 5 to the national legislature for deliberation.
The country will consolidate and enhance its leading position in industries such as intelligent connected new energy vehicles, step up development of hydrogen power, new materials, innovative drugs, and other cutting-edge sectors, according to the report.

Recently, local governments across China have been outlining their ""roadmaps"" to foster the development of new quality productive forces at local ""two sessions"" meetings, the annual meetings of provincial-level lawmakers and political advisors.
Beijing is actively building an international science and technology innovation center. Anhui province is accelerating the development of three major science and technology innovation hubs in quantum information, fusion energy, and deep space exploration.
Moreover, Heilongjiang province is implementing digital transformation in manufacturing, empowering small and medium-sized enterprises with digital capabilities, and promoting pilot demonstration projects in intelligent manufacturing.
What do ""new quality productive forces"" mean?
The term refers to contemporary advanced productive forces that are generated by revolutionary technological breakthroughs, innovative allocation of production factors, and in-depth transformation and upgrading of industries. It takes the qualitative change of laborers, labor materials, labor objects and their optimal combination as the basic connotation, and the improvement of total factor productivity as the core indicator.
Technological innovation can give rise to new industries, new models, and new driving forces, which are the core elements for developing new quality productive forces.
In 2023, generative artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a shining star in the tech world. By the end of 2023, China had released over 200 large AI models, with more than 20 of them approved to provide services to the public.
Most of the large models available to the public are general-purpose foundational models. Their greater competence is to empower intelligent industrial production and accelerate the development of new quality productive forces.

Liu Qingfeng, chairman of China's leading AI and speech technology company iFLYTEK, noted that generative AI is one of the most significant technological innovations in recent decades. It has the potential to change the ways of content production, human-computer interaction, traditional business models, and the structure and competition pattern of industries.
A well-planned layout of industrial chains can effectively support the enhancement of new quality productive forces by optimizing resource allocation.
As a representative of new quality productive forces, the low-altitude economy has become an important direction for cultivating new momentum for development.
Today, China has developed a relatively complete industrial chain of the low-altitude economy, which has generated agglomeration effects.
Taking Shenzhen in Guangdong province as an example, by the end of 2023, it has gathered more than 1,700 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) companies with an annual output value of 96 billion yuan ($13.34 billion). Chinese civil UAV manufacturers, represented by DJI, are strongly competitive in the global market.
According to a DJI executive, DJI's success benefited from the supporting and well-developed industrial chain in Shenzhen. With the continuous improvement of the entire Pearl River Delta's electronic consumer goods industrial chain, DJI's production capacity has been further strengthened.
To develop new quality productive forces, it is necessary to promote the digital economy, facilitating the deep integration of the digital economy with the real economy.
In recent years, new technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and new energy have been widely applied in the transportation industry, expanding the scope of intelligent transportation applications.
Anhui Transport Consulting & Design Institute Co., Ltd. (ATCDI) developed a design system that automatically generates drawings for commonly used bridge structures. The system has been in operation for over a year and has generated drawings for more than 7,400 times, significantly reducing the workload of frontline designers.

""Fostering new quality productive forces in the field of engineering information technology, such as intelligent manufacturing, digital design, as well as 3D laser scanning and inspection, can enable us to build bridges and roads more efficiently, thus better benefiting the people,"" said Nie Wenhua, deputy director of the ATCDI digital innovation center.
Currently, some regions in China are focusing on the building of industrial chains for new quality productive forces, so as to enhance the resilience and security of industrial and supply chains.
The municipal government of Beijing has proposed to promote the high-quality development of the new energy vehicle industry and actively establish industrial chains of key components, such as motors, batteries, electronic controls, and automotive-grade chips.
The government of Shandong province said that it would carry out actions to promote the high-quality development of iconic industrial chains. It would implement 100 major scientific and technological innovation projects in fields such as integrated circuits and industrial machinery.
Some regions are working to remove barriers and bottlenecks that hinder the development of new quality productive forces, and have made innovative allocation of production factors a key focus of their work this year.
The government work report of Liaoning province proposed to promote the integrated development of strategic emerging industries such as new materials, aerospace, low-altitude economy, robotics, biomedicine and medical equipment, new energy vehicles, and integrated circuit equipment.
Jiangsu province said in its government work report that it would focus on future industries and explore new sectors such as future networks, quantum technology, life science, hydrogen energy and new energy storage, as well as deep-sea, deep-earth, and aerospace exploration.
Accelerating the formation of new quality productive forces also relies on the development of human resources.
A program on cultivating high-skilled talents, jointly implemented by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and six other departments, noted that China will cultivate leading talents in key industries such as advanced manufacturing and modern services, focusing on major strategies, major projects and key industrial needs of the country. China will strive to cultivate over 15,000 new leading talents and drive the addition of around 5 million high-skilled talents within approximately three years.

"China's landmark deep-Earth borehole drilling project achieves 10,000-meter milestone",2024-03-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0306/c90000-20141171.html,"Home>>
		
China's landmark deep-Earth borehole drilling project achieves 10,000-meter milestone
 (Xinhua) 09:11, March 06, 2024
URUMQI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved a significant breakthrough in deep-Earth exploration with the drilling of a superdeep borehole in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region exceeding the 10,000-meter mark, making it the deepest vertical well in Asia, even though the project as a whole is not yet completed.
Amid the continuous humming of the drilling rig, the number on an electronic screen in the command center reached the milestone of 10,000 meters at 2:48 p.m. on Monday. More than a hundred workers on site, who had eagerly anticipated this moment, erupted into cheers.
Located in the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert in the Tarim Basin, ""Shenditake 1"" is a scientific exploratory borehole with a designed depth of 11,100 meters. In addition to searching for oil and gas resources, it is also tasked with pursuits such as exploring the evolution of Earth.
Min Peng, director of the drilling platform, could not contain his excitement. ""There was hardly any comparable drilling data for reference at such depths, and no technical parameters to rely on, yet we still managed to achieve it,"" he said.
Situated between the Tianshan and Kunlun mountains, the Tarim Basin has a rich accumulation of deep-seated oil and gas. But it is also one of the most difficult areas to explore due to its harsh surface environment and complicated underground conditions.
Since the start of drilling on May 30, 2023, the borehole has penetrated 13 continental strata, with more than 1,000 drill pipes driven into the Earth and over 20 drill bits consumed in the process, while the difficulty of drilling has escalated as the depth increased.
""It took nearly 5 months to drill from the surface to a depth of 8,000 meters, while it took over 4 months to drill from 8,000 meters to 10,000 meters,"" said Wang Chunsheng, chief expert of the Tarim Oilfield of China National Petroleum Corporation, which is in charge of the drilling.
After exceeding 10,000 meters, the drilling will face even more severe challenges, such as temperatures of over 200 degrees Celsius and formation pressure exceeding 130 MPa, said Wang.
""In such an environment, the drill pipes behave like cooked noodles, making them difficult to control. Workers can only rely on experience to make judgments and carry out operations,"" Wang added.
Facing a world-class challenge, the Tarim Oilfield established an interdisciplinary work platform with nine technical support teams and equipped them with top-notch tools.
According to Li Yahui, chief designer of the ""Shenditake 1"" drilling rig, the independently developed automated drilling rig has a load capacity of over 900 tonnes and is capable of reaching depths of up to 12,000 meters. A number of core technologies for drilling superdeep wells, such as ultra-high-temperature drilling fluid, have also been developed.
""Going deeper into the Earth is a crucial strategic choice for securing China's energy supply,"" said Sun Jinsheng, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
In recent years, China has been continuously breaking records in terms of deep-Earth development. In 2023 alone, more than 70 wells drilled in the Tarim Oilfield had reached depths exceeding 8,000 meters, delivering a total production of 19.57 million tonnes of ultra-deep oil and gas.
The deepest vertical well in the world today, located in Russia, has a depth of 12,262 meters. Jia Chengzao, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said ""Shenditake 1"" has become the second-deepest vertical well worldwide and is of milestone significance in deep-Earth scientific research and ultra-deep oil and gas exploration.
After reaching 10,000 meters, the drilling at ""Shenditake 1"" persists at full throttle towards its target depth of 11,100 meters.

Scientists find genetic basis making some pandas brown
 (Xinhua) 08:48, March 06, 2024
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese zoologists have identified a genetic source making the coat color of some giant pandas appear unusually brown and white.
The world's first brown panda was discovered in 1985 in the Qinling Mountains in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. All recorded photographs of the wild brown pandas were taken in the area. A recent adopted one is the male brown-and-white panda Qizai born in 2009.
The scientists from the Institute of Zoology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences sequenced the genomes of three panda families connected with Qizai, as well as other 29 pandas in black and white check.
They found that the mutation in a gene called Bace2 that encodes a precursor protein's cleaving enzyme is the most likely genetic basis for brown-and-white coat color, according to a study published on Monday in the U.S. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
A further genome analysis on 192 captive black-and-white pandas revealed that none of them carry such a mutation. Also, a genetically engineered mouse model with this mutation developed light fur, according to the study.
The results provide unique insights into the genetic basis of coat color variation in wild animals and will guide scientific breeding of the rare brown pandas, said the researchers.

Interview: Ethiopia launches innovative satellite data service in partnership with China
 (Xinhua) 10:25, March 05, 2024
ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Space Science and Geospatial Institute (SSGI) has launched a ""Ground Station as a Service"" initiative, involving the reception of satellite data for different countries, organizations and users, an official said.
Melaku Muka, director of satellite operations at SSGI, said that the institute has begun generating revenue through receiving satellite data, processing and analyzing them for various organizations and countries on a payment basis. The Chinese-built ground station at the Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center in Addis Ababa is at the core of this initiative, capable of receiving high-quality satellite data.
""The institute has begun providing full-fledged ground station services, including satellite communication, data reception and processing, and up-linking those data to clients,"" Muka said in an interview with Xinhua in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
The launch of the initiative signifies Ethiopia's strides to join the global satellite data market and helps the East African country earn revenue from the sector.
The payment modality for the service is arranged based on the amount of time spent per pass or minute used by the data reception station. According to the director, organizations that do not have ground stations due to limited budgets, satellite operators that require frequent communication and reception of data, and research institutions are taking advantage of the institute's ""Ground Station as a Service"" arrangement.
""Instead of building their own ground stations, users can access cost-effective data center services by paying only for the time slots they utilize,"" the director said, indicating that the arrangement allows entities to access global satellite data without incurring high costs.
In December 2019, Ethiopia launched its first-ever satellite, abbreviated as ETRSS-1, into space from China. The command and control center is located on the 3,200-meter-high hill of Entoto, a mountainous area on the outskirts of Addis Ababa.
Noting that cooperation between China and Ethiopia in space science technology has strengthened over time, Muka said China's role in helping Ethiopia launch its first satellite was ""remarkable.""
""In May 2021, Ethiopia launched a 7.3 meters multi-satellite receiving ground station. Using this ground station, we have been receiving high-resolution satellite images with different domains,"" he said, recalling that a Chinese company built the ""state-of-the-art"" ground station at Entoto.
Appreciating the successful capacity building, technology, and knowledge transfer from Chinese space science experts, Muka said Ethiopian professionals are now able to independently manage the entire satellite operations and provide valuable data for end-users.
""The Chinese help was very profound, particularly when Ethiopia launched its first satellite into space from China,"" the director said.

China should adopt regulations to address AI copyright infringements: CPPCC member,2024-03-05,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0305/c90000-20140723.html,"Home>>
		
China should adopt regulations to address AI copyright infringements: CPPCC member
 (Global Times) 10:10, March 05, 2024
China should adopt regulations to clarify the fundamental issues of copyright protection in the field of artificial intelligence, as copyright infringement is regarded as one of the biggest obstacles to promoting industry flourishing, a political advisor proposed at the annual two sessions.
The explosive development of large generative artificial intelligence models represented by ChatGPT has brought unprecedented challenges to the copyright industry and artistic creation, and even poses a huge potential risk to the foundation of high-quality development of artistic creation and cultural prosperity, Qiu Huadong, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, wrote in his proposal.
He noticed the fact that developers commonly use a large amount of copyrighted content in training activities without obtaining authorization from the rights holders or paying them compensation.
At the same time, Qiu said rights holders are unable to clearly understand how artificial intelligence uses their works, which is also one of the biggest obstacles to protecting their rights. This violates the provisions of the Civil Code and the Copyright Law.
In China, reactions to copyright of content generated by artificial intelligence have been mixed, Qiu said, adding that judgments of Chinese courts are not consistent either.
Besides, the theoretical arguments are often lacking, failing to provide guidance to rights holders, developers, and users of artificial intelligence, and users of content generated by artificial intelligence, which has hindered the orderly and positive development of the related market, the CPPCC further noted.
Using artificial intelligence programs to generate fake voices, and generate videos and audios could not only constitute serious infringement on natural persons' portrait rights, voice rights, name rights, and other personality rights and personal information but also pose a risk of confusing the public's visual and auditory perception through the use of deep synthesis techniques, he added.
The Beijing Internet Court ruled in an initial decision that an AI-generated image in an intellectual property dispute was an artwork protected by copyright law, which is the first case of its kind ruled in China.
The court recognized the picture generated via text-to-image AI image generator should be considered ""artwork"" under the protection of copyright laws based on the ""originality"" and intellectual input of its human creator.
According to this announcement, the court ruled in the first-instance judgment requiring the defendant to issue a public apology and pay the plaintiff 500 yuan ($70.16) in compensation. The defendant did not seek to appeal the initial decision.
However, the Global Times learned from some industry observers that the case emphasized whether the artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) constitutes a work with copyright cannot be generalized but should be decided on a case-to-case basis.
Most industry observers believed that writing prompts to generate a work is a simple task, resulting in minimal intellectual contribution to AI-generated image creation.
To address the challenges brought by copyright infringement, Qiu proposed that the country should issue supporting regulations of the Copyright Law that clarify copyright infringements in the artificial intelligence industry.
Without legal authorization, content protected by copyright and related rights should not be used in the training or pre-training process of artificial intelligence models, and it is not appropriate to include the training or pre-training activities of artificial intelligence models in the scope of fair use of copyright, he said.
“Those regulations should clearly stipulate that content generated solely by artificial intelligence without human creative participation should not be protected by copyright or related rights,” Qiu noted.
In addition, the standards for copyright protection of AI-generated works should be specified, such as the extent of human involvement and how to measure it (including but not limited to judicial practice activities).
Furthermore, he said that China should issue relevant laws, regulations, and departmental rules that are able to ensure the use of copyright content can be traced.
Apart from lawsuits relating to AI-generated images, China has also seen a first legal dispute over a virtual human.
In July 2022, a technology company in Hangzhou uploaded a video to their Douyin account featuring Ada, a virtual human created by Shanghai-based Xmov Technology but failed to acknowledge Xmov as the original creators. The Hangzhou Internet Court later sided with Xmov, ordering the infringing company to pay 120,000 yuan in compensation.

China leads global green technology innovation: study
 (Xinhua) 08:43, March 05, 2024
BERLIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China has made a ""rapid rise"" over the last 20 years to become one of the leading research nations in green technologies, German media reported on Sunday, citing a new study by the German think-tank Bertelsmann Stiftung.
""In terms of research dynamics, no other country can keep up with China,"" as the country is ""the most important driver of growth"" in green technologies worldwide, according to the study.
In terms of world-class patents, the top 10 percent of patents for a particular technology, China is already in second place, only after the United States. The country has more than tripled its world-class patents in green technologies to 37,000 since 2017, while the share of the United States, Japan, and the European Union (EU) saw declines.
In most categories, China is among the top three research locations worldwide, but is already number one in the category ""Sustainable consumables/recycling."" The country has nearly doubled its global share in this category over the last five years to almost 40 percent.
Since 2006, the Chinese government's efforts to support the circular economy have led to higher resource productivity and the relative decoupling of resource consumption from gross domestic product growth, according to the study.
In particular, drinking water treatment and the recycling of batteries and fuel cells, cement recycling and the recycling of plastics, glass, paper, electronics and consumer waste were ""to be highlighted as Chinese strengths,"" the study said.
China made the largest share of its world-class green technology patents in the field of efficient production. Above all, networked production (smart factory), efficient industrial production in the petrochemical and textile industries and digital agriculture were ""of great importance.""

Spokesman: China's self-reliance drive not aimed at closing doors
By Xu Wei (Chinadaily.com.cn) 15:59, March 04, 2024
A spokesman for China's national legislature highlighted openness and cooperation as correct choices for exploring the frontiers of science and furthering sci-tech progress, saying that the nation's self-reliance drive does not mean Beijing will close its doors in its research and development.Lou Qinjian, spokesman for the second session of the 14th National People's Congress, told a news conference on Monday that China will remain committed to participating in the global innovation network, jointly advancing basic research and promoting the transformation of scientific and technological outcomes.He warned that engaging in practices of ""decoupling"" or ""building a small yard with high walls"" will only hinder global technological progress, damage global industrial development, and widen the global development gap.Lou gave the example of the Beidou Satellite Navigation System, which was developed after China's cooperation with relevant countries and region to launch a similar navigation system stalled.He said the Beidou system, developed through 30 years of relentless effort and hard work, has been widely used globally, empowering various industries and becoming a cornerstone of economic and social development.""This example fully demonstrates that as long as we insist on self-reliance and self-improvement, there is no difficulty we cannot overcome,"" he said.
