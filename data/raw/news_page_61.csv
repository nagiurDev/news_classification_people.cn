China has rolled out an ethical guideline for brain-computer interfaces (BCI) aiming to better guide the compliant development of BCI research and prevent ethical risks in the process of research and technological applications.
The released guideline by the Ministry of Science and Technology comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the success of a procedure to implant Neuralink's brain chip into the first human patient.
This guideline, compiled by the artificial intelligence ethics subcommittee of the National Committee for Science and Technology Ethics, released by the Ministry on Friday, serves as a reference for scientific research institutions and researchers.
It outlines the basic principles to be followed in conducting BCI research which are safeguarding health and enhancing well-being, respecting subjects involved and apply the technology on them moderately, adhering to fairness and ensuring equity, risk management and ensuring safety, information disclosure and ensuring informed consent, supporting innovation and strict regulation.
For rare diseases that seriously endanger life and have no other effective treatment methods, clinical trials of innovative BCI products can be conducted with full informed consent under strict compliance with national regulations on medical devices and clinical research, the guideline pointed out.
The guideline highlights that research that replaces or weakens human judgment and decision-making abilities, significantly interferes with or blurs human autonomy and self-awareness should be avoided, when enhanced BCI technologies have yet been fully proven to be superior to human capabilities and have gained social consensus.
The guideline puts forward specific requirements in seven aspects, including legality and compliance, social and scientific values, informed consent, privacy protection and personal information protection, risk prevention and control, qualification requirements, and responsibility mechanisms.
It says that BCI research should establish a safety risk prevention and control mechanism, including strict operating procedures, common error correction mechanisms, emergency plans, suspension procedures and emergency remedial guidelines to ensure the safety of subjects. BCI research should also enhance system transparency, interpretability, reliability and controllability, ensuring accountability in technology design, development, use, deployment and other stages.
Zhang Linghan, professor of law at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, welcomed the guideline. She told the Global Times that it is a timely basic reference for BCI researchers.
In specific human experimentation studies, there may be ethical conflicts between the health benefits of the subjects and the scientific development and social benefits, she noted, adding that the scientific development, achievements of researchers and health benefits to the public are also based on the risks, contributions, and even certain harm to and sacrifice of these subjects.
The guideline also provides ethical guidelines for five types of research: non-invasive restorative BCI research, invasive restorative BCI research, interventional BCI research, enhanced BCI research, and animal BCI research.
Specifically, non-invasive restorative BCI research collects patients’ brain signals in a non-invasive manner and decodes the signals to control external devices, improving patients' motor and communication functions. Invasive restorative brain-machine interfaces involve neurosurgical procedures and implant placement, which pose short-term and long-term safety risks. Research in this area should comply with relevant national laws, regulations, and standards, adhere to medical ethics norms, and monitor long-term safety risks, including brain injury.
Interventional brain-machine interfaces involve interventional surgery and placement of intravascular implants, and monitoring long-term infection risks associated with implanted devices and closely observing adverse reactions such as intravascular thrombosis, the guideline reads.
The guideline clarifies that enhanced BCI refers to brain-machine interface technologies that enhance users' perception, cognition, and motor abilities of normal bodily functions. They are generally non-invasive and require a thorough examination of risks and benefits and minimization of negative impacts on humans.
Research that may cause addiction, affect normal human thinking and behavior should be strictly controlled, it stresses.
Zhang noted that the guideline highlights China’s long-standing value placed on the protection of subjects in medical research.
Health authorities established a Biomedical Research Ethics Review Committee involving human subjects and formulated the Guidelines for Ethical Review of Medical Research in 1998 and then the Ministry of Health promulgated and implemented the measures for ethical review of biomedical research involving humans on January 11, 2007, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Physician Law and the Regulations on the Administration of Medical Institutions.
These regulations clearly state that all research involving human subjects must comply with the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki, which emphasizes fairness, respect for human dignity, maximizing the benefits to subjects, and minimizing harm as much as possible, Zhang noted.
Chinese scientists recently made a breakthrough in the world's first patient BCI rehabilitation trial. Led by principal Biomedical Engineering researcher Hong Bo from the School of Medicine with Tsinghua University, the trial designed and developed the wireless minimally invasive implanted BCI technology device called NEO (Neural Electronic Opportunity). A NEO device was successfully implanted into a patient's brain for the BCI-assisted treatment trial at Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing on October 24, 2023.
Team leader Hong told the Global Times in an earlier interview that compared with Neuralink's technology, the NEO technology has the advantages of higher safety and long-term use.
Application scenarios of future BCI technology are very extensive. By recording and interpreting brain signals, direct communication between the brain and the computer can be achieved. This technology can not only help patients with brain diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neuron disease), spinal cord injury and epilepsy to recover, but also has the potential to achieve brain-computer fusion intelligence and expand the brain's information processing capabilities.
Apart from ethnical reviews on BCI, Zhang told the Global Times for BCI experiments and the related data, they should be managed in data classification based on the importance of the data.
Citing the Data Security Law, Zhang said handlers of important data should regularly conduct risk assessments of their data processing activities and submit risk assessment reports to relevant regulatory authorities to reduce the risk of data security incidents occurring. On the outbound transfer of important data should also undergo a security assessment, the Chinese expert said.

Better ways to treat chronic diseases highlighted
By Zheng Caixiong (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:46, February 05, 2024
People with obesity, diabetes and related chronic diseases will receive more effective treatments involving precision medicines in the near future, according to a recently published medical study.The paper, titled ""The Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study enables generational genetic discoveries"" and compiled by experts from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, was published in the academic journal Nature on Wednesday. It reveals how, using scientific methods, health issues concerning parents, especially mothers, and children can be more efficiently addressed.Qiu Xiu, director of the women's health division at the center, said the study indicates there may be more precise methods for early intervention in chronic diseases such as obesity in children and adults.""More personalized information will help us prescribe precision medicines, and for common diseases, we can offer corresponding treatments based on individual conditions,"" she said at a news conference in Guangzhou on Friday.Many young women experience dry, itchy skin after pregnancy. In Guangdong, some people refer to it as ""fetal toxicity"", Qiu said. ""However, it may actually be due to the high level of total bile acid in pregnant women, who suffer from cholestasis (bile build-up in the liver).""Currently, doctors prescribe pregnant women medicines for itchiness based on clinical diagnosis, but in the future, they will be better equipped with more information, Qiu said, adding that doctors could test pregnant women for genetic mutations.""The early stages of life is an important window for prevention and control of adult chronic diseases,"" the expert said, emphasizing that it is necessary to understand if exposure to adverse environments is leading to diseases, and what the pathogenic factors are.Qiu and her team found that there is a correlation between newborn fat metabolism and fetal growth status at various stages of pregnancy.Their long-term study encompassed the sequencing and analysis of 4,053 Chinese individuals, and used a cross-generational Mendelian randomization method over a period of two-and-a-half years to clarify the potential causal relationship between pregnancy variables and fetal growth.""For example, for every one millimol per liter increase in maternal fasting blood sugar, the birth weight of the baby increases by 516.2 grams. For every one mmol/L increase in maternal total bile acid during pregnancy, the baby's birth length decreases by 0.42 centimeters,"" Qiu said.Xia Huimin, academic leader and professor of pediatric surgery at the center, said in the study that the researchers discovered a new gene mutation related to cholestasis, which is involved in the entire liver bile metabolism process and may cause or worsen the degree of primary jaundice in newborns.In addition, the study found for the first time a causal relationship between maternal total bile acid during pregnancy and the birth length of babies, he said.Zhou Wenhao, president of the center, said that cholestasis during pregnancy not only has an impact on the development of the fetus in the uterus, but also leads to poor adaptability of the fetus after birth and a high risk of death.""If candidate genes are identified and used as early targets for testing, doctors can use drugs to reduce the level of total bile acid in pregnant women, alleviate clinical symptoms and improve fetal growth,"" he said.

Backgrounder: China's Xichang space launch site reaches milestone 200th mission
 (Xinhua) 13:48, February 04, 2024
XICHANG, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Xichang space launch site, the inland launch site of the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, located in the southwestern Sichuan Province, on Saturday achieved a milestone with its 200th launch mission.
Carried by a Long March-2C carrier rocket, the 11 Geely-02 constellation satellites took off at 7:37 a.m. (Beijing Time) from the launch site, and entered the preset orbit.
This site conducted its first launch mission in 1984, which means it took 40 years to reach 200 -- currently the fastest of all launch sites in China to reach this milestone.
On April 8, 1984, a Long March carrier rocket carrying a Dongfanghong-2 experiment communications satellite blasted off at this site and successfully deployed the satellite in space, marking the first launch mission at this venue.
This launch site has since then been consistently contributing to China's aerospace industry with multiple landmark launch missions involving carrier rockets, satellites and other spacecraft, such as the Chang'e-1 lunar probe and the first BeiDou satellite.
China has three inland launch sites, namely the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in the north, and the Xichang launch site of the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwest.
In addition, one coastal launch site, the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, under the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, is located in south China's Hainan Province.
Established in 1970, the Xichang Satellite Launch Center is mainly responsible for launching geosynchronous-orbit satellites and other space launch missions from both its inland Xichang launch site and its coastal Wenchang launch site.
The Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site has also carried out multiple major space launch missions, such as the maiden flight of China's new-generation high-thrust carrier rocket, the country's first planetary exploration mission, and the construction of China's space station.
Both Xichang and Wenchang launch sites under the Xichang Satellite Launch Center are capable of carrying out intensive space launch missions thanks to the center's determined efforts in pursuit of tech-innovation and capability enhancement, according to the center.

"Int'l scientists conduct joint experiments with China's ""artificial sun"" team",2024-02-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0204/c90000-20130654.html,"Home>>
		
Int'l scientists conduct joint experiments with China's ""artificial sun"" team
 (Xinhua) 11:10, February 04, 2024
HEFEI, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- As the Chinese New Year approaches, a small island in the northwest suburb of Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province, is buzzing not because of the fireworks, but because of the operation of the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST), also known as the ""Chinese artificial sun.""
Before the upcoming Spring Festival, which falls on Feb. 10, over 100 Chinese and foreign scientists conducted EAST-ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) joint physics experiments on the ""Science Island,"" which is home to EAST. The purpose of these experiments was to address relevant technical problems for the international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject ITER.
The ultimate goal of the EAST is to create nuclear fusion like the sun, using substances abundant in the sea to provide a steady stream of clean energy.
Built in southern France by seven ITER members -- China, the EU, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States, ITER will be the world's largest experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor.
A tokamak is basically a magnetic cage designed to confine, shape and control the super-hot plasmas that make fusion reactions possible. The success of the fusion endeavor will crucially depend on the development of new materials capable of withstanding the harsh conditions inside a fusion reactor.
In 2023, ITER organization decided to change the wall material from beryllium to tungsten, which is predicted to reduce the retention of tritium inside ITER's vessel and the production of dust.
With the same technology path and experimental conditions as ITER and advanced research of wall materials, EAST, which has set many world records in the field of nuclear fusion energy research, was chosen by ITER organization to cooperate with and optimize its new plans.
According to Alberto Loarte, head of the ITER Science Division, ITER scientists aims to verify the reliability and operability of the new material by the joint experiments with EAST team, and to seek faster progression.
Currently, EAST team has completed the replacement of the wall materials of the vacuum chamber following the requirements. Since mid-January, more than 30 ITER researchers have arrived at the island to promote the experiments, together with over 100 scientists online.
China officially joined the ITER program in 2006 as the seventh member. Nearly 10 percent of the procurement packages were undertaken by China, and the Institute of Plasma Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP) is the main unit of the Chinese mission.
""More than 100 people from our team travel to ITER headquarters almost every year to carry out joint research, and ASIPP has established stable communication and cooperation with more than 120 research institutions in more than 50 countries, including Europe, the United States, Russia and Japan,"" said Gong Xianzu, head of Division of EAST Physics and Experimental Operations.
Gong said that EAST will also learn from international advanced technology experience through this joint experiment and prepare for China's future experimental reactors.
""One thing I really like here is, you can see in the control room, the large number of young people that are involved in the project. And this is exactly what fusion needs,"" said Richard Pitts, leader of the Experiments and Plasma Operation Section of ITER.
Pitts said that ITER should be seen as a foundational project to bring the nations together, and China is a brilliant example of that.

Chinese researchers reveal metabolic changes in primate pregnancy
 (Xinhua) 10:43, February 04, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have revealed the characteristics of the metabolic changes of primates during pregnancy, which is expected to help study the mechanism of diseases during pregnancy.
Pregnancy induces dramatic metabolic changes in females, but the intricacies of this metabolic reprogramming remained unclear, especially in primates, according to Huang Shiqiang with the Institute of Zoology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the corresponding authors of the study.
Exploring the characteristics and mechanisms of these adaptive changes is of great significance for the prevention of related diseases, Huang said.
Cynomolgus monkeys are similar to humans in terms of physiology, reproductive characteristics and pregnancy cycle thus they were the ideal animal models to use in the study that focused on the pregnancy adaptation of the various tissues and organs in primate mothers.
Using cynomolgus monkeys, researchers constructed a comprehensive multi-tissue metabolome atlas, analyzing 273 samples from 23 maternal tissues during pregnancy.
They found that the monkeys experienced great metabolic disturbance and challenge during pregnancy, and metabolic reprogramming occurred in various tissues and organs.
The results of this research contribute to a better understanding of how primate females adapt to the metabolic challenges during pregnancy, and will also help enhance the study scope of the adaptive changes and regulatory mechanisms of their vital tissues and organs during primate pregnancy, said Wang Hongmei with the Institute of Zoology, another corresponding author of the study.
The study was recently published in the journal Cell.

China's MA60 firefighting aircraft embarks on airworthiness flight tests
By Hu Tao (Xinhua) 10:06, February 04, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- China's MA60 firefighting aircraft, an independently developed aeronautical equipment tailored to serve emergency rescue missions, has entered its crucial stage of airworthiness compliance flight tests, according to the developer.
MA60 firefighting aircraft, a new member of the Modern Ark multipurpose aircraft family, initiated its flight tests in late January to verify its compliance with the airworthiness regulations of the Chinese civil aviation authorities, said the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).
It has already performed various flight test subjects, such as hedgehopping and dropping of its maximum water capacity of six tonnes at a very low altitude of about 50 meters during the flight tests, the AVIC added.
Flight tests have demonstrated that water dropped from the aircraft can cover a ground area measuring 200 meters in length and 30 meters in width.
MA60 firefighting aircraft is a large and medium-sized fixed-wing plane that is specially tailored to serve aerial firefighting and other rescues.
It is developed by AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd. in Xi'an, located in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, with independent intellectual property rights. The aircraft has been designed in strict adherence to the airworthiness regulations stipulated by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
The development and progress of the MA60 firefighting aircraft will support China in cultivating a comprehensive aerial firefighting capability with small, medium and large aircraft, which will further support the country in building a national comprehensive emergency rescue system, said Guo Zhiwu, a senior official with the Ministry of Emergency Management.
""The application of fixed-wing aircraft in fighting against fire in China is in the initial stage, with broad market prospects,"" Guo said.
He noted that the further development of the MA60 firefighting aircraft, along with pilot training and other related activities, will facilitate the successful integration of this new aircraft model into the emergency air rescue system.
As a key model developed for China's emergency air rescue system, the MA60 firefighting aircraft features remarkable maneuverability and capability to fly at low speeds in low altitudes. This enables precise and effective water release over fire sites in complex settings, enhancing the overall efficiency of firefighting operations.
It will mainly be used for combating forest and grassland fires, as it can perform multiple rescue operations, such as fire monitoring, water dropping, telecommunications support, as well as the transportation of personnel and supplies.
The development team will accelerate follow-up flight tests and related works for the aircraft to facilitate its development, airworthiness and delivery, and contribute to China's emergency rescue works, the AVIC said.

Smart Dragon 3 rocket successfully completes third space launch
By Zhao Lei (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:19, February 04, 2024
China launched a Smart Dragon 3 carrier rocket on Saturday morning off the coast of Yangjiang in Guangdong province, placing nine satellites in space.
The rocket blasted off at 11:07 am from a launch service ship, thundering up into cloudy skies.
After a short flight, the vehicle deployed the satellites into their preset orbital positions, marking the success of the launch mission, China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, maker of the Smart Dragon 3 series, announced soon after the liftoff.
This has been the third space launch conducted from the South China Sea. It is also the first time the Smart Dragon 3 model to has launched a foreign satellite — one of the nine satellites, NExSat-1, is an experimental spacecraft built by Egypt's National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences, and Germany's Berlin Space Technologies.
The Smart Dragon 3 is a solid-propellant rocket model. The type is 31 meters tall, has a diameter of 2.65 meters and can carry a liftoff weight of 140 metric tons. It is mainly propelled by a high-performance, solid-propellant engine, which holds 71 tons of propellant that creates a thrust of 200 tons.
The rocket is capable of sending multiple satellites with a combined weight of 1.5 tons to a typical sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 500 kilometers.
Smart Dragon 3 made its maiden flight in December 2022 from a ship in the Yellow Sea, placing 14 satellites into orbit. Its second mission took place in December 2023 off Yangjiang, becoming the first sea-based rocket launch from the South China Sea.
The Smart Dragon 3 is suitable for clients who wish to quickly launch large numbers of satellites to establish space-based commercial networks as soon as possible, according to Jin Xin, the rocket's project manager.
By now, China has performed 10 sea-based launches — five by the Long March 11 rocket model, three by the Smart Dragon 3, one by the Ceres 1 rocket of the Beijing-based private company Galactic Energy and another one by the Gravity 1 of Orienspace, another private company in Beijing. Seven of those took place in the Yellow Sea while three in the South China Sea.

SHANGHAI, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has mapped out how hippocampus neurons connect with other areas in the brain of a mouse. The hippocampus is a part of the brain that plays a major role in learning, memory and feelings.
The team's results revealed some previously unknown principles of organization concerning hippocampal axon projections, generating more clues to how our brain works and suggesting potential targets for brain diseases, according to the study published on Friday in the journal Science.
The hippocampus is widely connected with multiple brain areas, including the cortex, hypothalamus and olfactory areas. However, it remains unclear how its single neurons project to brain-wide target areas.
The researchers from the Institute of Neuroscience under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Huazhong University of Science and Technology created an open database containing 10,100 single-neuron neural projections located throughout the mouse hippocampus.
They classified them into 341 projection patterns and 43 subtypes.
The team also created an open online database that enables interactive visualization and analysis of the study's data.

CHANGSHA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have identified a new snake species featuring a bright yellow neck collar in central China's Hunan Province.
The newly discovered Achalinus nanshanensis belongs to the genus Achalinus, commonly known as odd-scaled snakes. It is only found in the two counties of Chengbu and Tongdao in the southwest of Hunan.
The discovery has increased the number of identified Achalinus species in the world to 28, according to the article published recently in the scientific journal ZooKeys.
Achalinus is a group of cave-dwelling, earthworm-eating snakes featuring scales that shine colorfully under the light, said Mo Xiaoyang, one author of the article and a professor with Hunan Normal University.
Achalinus nanshanensis stands out with its bright yellow neck collar, a feature that caught the attention of researchers during their fieldwork between 2022 and 2023, leading to the identification of the new species, according to Mo.
This non-venomous snake mostly inhabits subtropical forests and is often spotted near streams after rain, researchers say.
Mainly distributed in China, Vietnam and Japan, the genus Achalinus is the most diverse genus of the family Xenodermidae.

Experts call for appropriate use of AI tools
By Zhao Yimeng (China Daily) 08:46, February 02, 2024
Generative artificial intelligence tools shouldn't be banned in schools but should be applied safely and appropriately to empower the innovative development of education, experts and officials said.
The swift advancement of ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies has offered more opportunities for teachers as well as students, experts said at the 2024 World Digital Education Conference in Shanghai, which concluded on Wednesday. It also poses new challenges regarding information security and education equality, they said.
Zheng Qinghua, president of Tongji University, said China should embrace the opportunities and challenges of AI-empowered education and guide young people to understand knowledge created by technology while stimulating their motivation for learning.
""Generative AI technology has become an essential tool for obtaining and spreading knowledge. It has an impact on teaching, learning and even school management,"" said Zheng, who is also an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
He said that various models developed by internet companies and universities have been applied to educational activities, and the majority of college students in China have used the technology, including Ernie Bot, an AI chatbot product developed by Baidu Inc.
These kinds of tools, with ChatGPT as a leading global example, are capable of writing essays and solving science problems, helping students with their assignments and tests.
A survey by the online learning platform Study.com found that 89 percent of students who responded had used ChatGPT to help with a homework assignment, which has raised questions about academic propriety and the disruptive effect of generative AI in education.
""We cannot simply let AI provide answers or do homework and tests for us. Instead, we should, based on the technology, better cultivate students to be more innovative and integrate professional disciplines to solve real problems,"" Zheng said.
""One of the new goals of AI-empowered education is to innovate theories and methods to tackle engineering and technical issues instead of simply answering general questions,"" he added.
Colin Bailey, president of Queen Mary University of London and a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said that with the rapid growth of ChatGPT, the question is not whether to use generative AI in education, but how to use it safely, effectively and appropriately.
""The worst thing we can do is to ban generative AI in schools. The major challenge is how to make sure we use these technologies appropriately to enhance the education so that students have the skills they require for the ever-changing job market,"" he said.
Universities and teachers can help prepare students for real-world applications of the technology they will encounter in the modern workplace, as many industries are embracing generative AI as a tool to increase efficiency, he added.
For teachers, the technology has been used to improve the marking and evaluation of students through personalized data analysis rather than exam papers.
Harm warned
However, poor design and misuse of AI systems could cause individual and social harm due to biased data and insufficient privacy, Bailey said.
Approaches to regulating AI have been emerging globally to support the ethical and responsible use of generative AI, such as the release by the United States of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and a pro-innovation approach to AI regulation in the United Kingdom.
In China, the Cyberspace Administration and other departments have jointly issued interim measures, which took effect in August, for managing generative AI services.
Chen Jie, vice-minister of education, said at the conference that education and research institutions should cooperate to avoid problems brought by AI, including privacy leaks, bias and algorithm abuse.
""We should work together to promote the equal access of technologies and prevent security risks,"" Chen said.
China has established an expert advisory body for education digitalization and an ethics committee for AI, which have formulated a standardized system for the application of digital education, he added.

BEIJING, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently confirmed the world's first successful cloning of endangered cattle breeds found in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region.
The Zhangmu and the Apeijiaza, two rare yellow cattle breeds native to the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, are strategic resources for China, as these breeds can help researchers breed varieties well adapted to the harsh high-altitude environment.
Yunyang County in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality saw the birth of four clones of each breed and they are currently in good condition.

THE METHOD
According to the third national survey of livestock and poultry genetic resources conducted in 2021 and 2022, there were just 19 heads of Zhangmu cattle in Xizang's Shigatse City and 39 heads of Apeijiaza cattle in the autonomous region's Nyingchi City.
To urgently bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, relevant departments and local authorities in China established a working group to protect the existing cattle, preserve their somatic cells, and make clones to increase their population.
Scientists collected ear tissue from the Zhangmu and the Apeijiaza, used somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to create cloned embryos and transplanted them into surrogate cows. After a full-term pregnancy, four male calves of each breed were born.
A head of the Zhangmu and three heads of the Apeijiaza were born through cesarean section, with researchers precisely determining the right timing for the operations.
WHY YUNYANG COUNTY WAS CHOSEN
As there are currently no suitable conditions for cloning in Xizang, researchers chose China's southwestern regions so that it would be convenient to deliver the clones back to Xizang.
Yunyang County was finally chosen due to its climate and terrain resembling that of the cattle's native habitat and for its cattle breeding technology.
OVERCOMING ALTITUDE CHALLENGE
Two calves of each breed will be returned to Xizang this summer, while the remaining four will be raised to adulthood in Yunyang County and their semen will be collected and frozen for preservation.
Bringing the cloned cattle back to Xizang may pose challenges related to transportation, abrupt changes in their living environment and potential risks of diseases.
These animals born in low-altitude Chongqing will be moved gradually to Xizang to help them adapt to the high altitude there.
Upon arrival in Xizang, the cloned cattle will be quarantined, carefully bred and closely monitored to ensure their health.
CLONING IN XIZANG
Scientists plan to create favorable conditions for cloning Zhangmu and Apeijiaza cows in Xizang to facilitate the rapid growth of the herd.
Experts believe that the cloning success has laid a foundation for cloning in Xizang and training specialized personnel, but technological obstacles remain to be cracked, such as obtaining oocytes and ensuring the maturity of extracorporeal embryos, among other factors.
STRENGTHENING PROTECTION IN HABITAT
In addition to striving for conditions conducive to cloning, local authorities in Xizang have also stepped up efforts for the protection of the naturally existing herd in the habitat, including setting up protection zones, creating protection cooperatives, intensifying disease control and improving animal-raising methods.
A new survey showed that nine Apeijiaza and six Zhangmu calves were born in Xizang in 2023. Researchers will work to boost the reproductive capacity of the cattle and the survival rate of the newborns.

Urban green space positively correlated with schoolchildren's visual acuity: study
 (Xinhua) 16:50, February 01, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have found that increased green space around home and school is associated with a slower decline in visual acuity among schoolchildren, according to a research article recently published in the journal Environment International.
Green space is known to have a positive impact on human health and well-being, while its potential effects on visual acuity have not been extensively studied. The study aims to examine the relationship between long-term green space exposure and visual acuity in children, while also exploring the potential mechanisms in this association.
The researchers from Sun Yat-sen University worked in collaboration with their counterparts from global universities to conduct the prospective cohort study based on the children's growth environment, lifestyle, and physical and mental health development. A total of 286,801 schoolchildren in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, were screened starting from 2016 and they were followed up over three academic years.
The analysis indicated that urban green space was positively associated with the vision level of schoolchildren while negatively associated with the risk of vision impairment.
Specifically, the greater the green space area, the lower the risk of visual impairment. An increased exposure to green space both at home and school was inversely correlated with the risk of visual impairment, according to the study.
The findings suggested that increasing green space exposure could benefit children's visual acuity development and reduce the risk of visual impairment by reducing air pollution and recreational screen time while increasing physical activity and outdoor time.

WUHAN, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese and New Zealand researchers has developed a type of membrane that can work for more than 5,000 hours to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into formic acid, a useful liquid chemical.
Researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China and University of Auckland designed the proton-exchange membrane system.
This durable carbon dioxide conversion is made possible by a catalyst derived from waste lead-acid batteries, according to the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
The system's conversion efficiency exceeds 90 percent, and its feasibility for industrial application has been validated on a preliminary basis, according to the researchers.
Electrolysis that converts carbon dioxide to useful chemicals can contribute to a more sustainable and carbon-neutral future.
China aims to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.
