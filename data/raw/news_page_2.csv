Australian-Chinese research finds deep ocean marine heatwaves underreported
 (Xinhua) 14:38, October 17, 2024
CANBERRA, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- A world-first research by Australia's national science agency and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has found that marine heatwaves in the deep ocean are underreported.
According to the research published on Thursday, 80 percent of marine heatwaves that occur at depths below 100 meters do not concur with surface events.
Marine heatwaves, which are prolonged temperature events that can cause severe damage to marine habitats, have been traditionally tracked by satellite data that focuses on surface temperatures.
The new research by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and CAS indicated that deep-water heatwaves could be significantly underreported.
""Our research reveals that marine heatwaves are often hidden below the surface and occur separately from those on the surface,"" Ming Feng, a co-author of the study from the CSIRO, said in a media release.
""These findings deepen our understanding of the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events under the ocean surface, and possible implications.""
The world-first global analysis of subsurface marine heatwaves and marine cold spells used long-term temperature observations from eight mooring sites in various ocean basins and over 2 million global historical temperature-profile measurements.
It found that ocean eddies, a type of circular current, have a crucial role in driving and intensifying subsurface marine heatwaves and marine cold spells.
Feng said the research found that marine heatwaves at deeper depths are often associated with eddies and that global warming has intensified temperature extremes in eddies in the past decades, which could result in more severe subsurface marine heatwaves.
The researchers said that better understanding of the drivers of marine heatwaves below the surface will help predict them in the future.

ROME, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (IPPCAAS) was awarded the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Achievement Award Wednesday at a ceremony held by the FAO to mark the 44th World Food Day in Rome, Italy.
FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu presented the prestigious FAO Achievement Award to the IPPCAAS and described their groundbreaking work in combating the Fall Armyworm as having a profound impact in China, across Asia, and globally, making significant strides in protecting crops and securing food supplies.
This year's World Food Day, with the theme ""Right to foods for a better life and a better future,"" aims to raise global awareness about the right to foods and advocates for transforming agrifood systems to support peaceful, resilient, and inclusive livelihoods for all.
According to the FAO, around 730 million people are currently facing hunger, and over 2.8 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet. This means that even if their calorie intake is sufficient, they may not be receiving the necessary nutrients and dietary diversity to maintain good health.
In his address, Qu called for renewed ""commitment to building more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable agrifood systems that can nourish the world,"" saying, ""There is no time to lose; we must take immediate action.""
In a video message, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that a zero-hunger world was possible, but ""food systems need a massive transformation,"" to become more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable.
As part of the World Food Day celebrations, a World Food Forum event is being held at FAO headquarters from Oct. 14 to 18.
The FAO Award for Achievement is awarded every two years to honor an entity or individual for outstanding technical cooperation or humanitarian work in the fields of sustainable agriculture, rural development, or food security at the country level.

The Qinling Mountains, mainly in northwest China's Shaanxi province, are a natural boundary between China's north and south in terms of geology, climate, biodiversity, water systems, and soil types.
The unique geographic environment creates abundant moisture, and the rugged terrain harbors rich plant and animal resources, earning the Qinling Mountains the nickname ""China's central park"" and establishing them as a crucial ecological barrier for the country.
In recent years, ecological protection and restoration of the Qinling Mountains has maintained a priority of Shaanxi province.
""There appears to be waste dumping in the east of Liyuanpo village in Shijing neighborhood,"" an alert popped up on the screen of a digital comprehensive monitoring platform for the Qinling Mountains of Huyi district of Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province.
Staff member Zhao Na immediately contacted Mao Juan, a local grid officer: ""Drones have captured footage, and AI analysis has detected unauthorized dumping.""
In less than an hour, Mao arrived at Liyuanpo village. Upon investigation, she learned that a villager had been renovating his house and had dumped construction waste by the roadside.

She promptly took photos for evidence, uploaded them from her phone, and informed the neighborhood office. After the area was cleared by the following morning, Mao revisited the site, verified the cleanup, and uploaded the update to the platform.
The ecological protection area of the Qinling Mountains covers six districts and counties in Xi'an, accounting for about 55 percent of the city's total area. The rapid handling of issues like this is a result of an integrated ecological monitoring and protection system for the Qinling Mountains.
The system includes satellites that provide periodic remote sensing images, drones that conduct routine patrol flights, cameras offering real-time monitoring, and 1,240 dedicated grid officers carrying out inspections.
""With this system, countless 'eyes' help us protect every ridge and valley of the Qinling Mountains,"" said Lei Bo, director of the technology and grid management department of the Xi'an municipal bureau of Qinling ecological environment protection.
From January to August this year, the platform autonomously identified and processed 2,480 cases involving unauthorized construction and dumping. Most cases were resolved within one to three days.
In recent years, Xi'an has continuously improved the systems and mechanisms for regular and long-term protection of the Qinling Mountains. The approach combines human inspection with technology-based monitoring, and grid-based management with networked coordination, making protection efforts more targeted and intelligent.

Now, the entire landscape can be visualized on a single map, which shows forests, rivers, buildings, and mineral distributions, creates a digital model of the Qinling Mountains.
Each village has its own grid, with at least one grid officer, which forms a four-tiered management system from the municipal level down to villages.
Municipal- and district-level platforms, as well as several industry-specific platforms have been integrated, enabling information sharing and seamless data exchange to form a unified digital supervision system for the Qinling Mountains.
""We can detect even the smallest fire, down to a single lighter, thanks to the integration of thermal, smoke, and light sensors,"" said Hua Yiping, director of the Qinling Mountains ecological protection and comprehensive law enforcement bureau of Huyi district. The digital monitoring platform now extends to multiple applications, including forest fire prevention, flood control, water quality monitoring, and geological disaster monitoring.
Currently, the populations of wild plants and animals in the Qinling Mountains are steadily increasing, with 99.3 percent of the Qinling Mountains area within Shaanxi province now rated as having an excellent ecological environment.
""In the future, we will continue to enhance the automation, intelligence, and precision of Qinling Mountains' protection measures. We aim to refine our monitoring systems and ensure thorough, dynamic inspections and remediation,"" said Li Bo, deputy director of the Xi'an municipal bureau of Qinling Mountains ecological environment protection.

Over the past 75 years, China's development of key scientific facilities has advanced in leaps and bounds, most notably in the past several decades as the Chinese economy and technological capacity have accelerated at great speed.
A key component of these facilities has been technologies that have enabled Chinese scientists to look deeper and deeper into the unknown.
Light allows us to see objects, while X-rays help us see the essence of things. X-rays with higher brightness can allow us to ""see"" the microstructures inside materials more clearly. Therefore, obtaining X-ray light sources with higher brightness is a goal tirelessly pursued by scientists.
""The synchrotron radiation light source that produces high-brightness X-rays is like a super microscope that helps researchers see what is happening inside materials at the molecular and atomic levels,"" said Tai Renzhong, vice-president of the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The brightness of X-rays from synchrotron radiation can be billions of times higher than ordinary X-rays. By using such light for experiments, scientists have been able to better understand approximately 70 percent of the known biological macromolecular structures in the world such as proteins, DNA, and viruses.
""As we advance certain industries, including super fibers, advanced engineering materials, energy catalysis, new energy batteries, and other key technologies, understanding what is happening internally is crucial for solving bottlenecks,"" said Tai, who is also deputy manager of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, explaining why these large synchrotron facilities are widely recognized worldwide.
As the first third-generation synchrotron radiation light source on the Chinese mainland, the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility has the highest number of users and output of any large scientific facility in China. In its 15 years of operation, it has been used by more than 60,000 researchers from nearly 700 research institutions and companies, supporting over 20,000 projects.
 
A key project being undertaken is the X-ray brain imaging research being conducted at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. It is expected to complete the first mesoscale neural connectivity map of the human brain in about three years, providing a breakthrough research tool for neuroscience.
The Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility has 34 beamlines and 46 experimental stations open to users, catering to cutting-edge basic research in multidisciplinary fields such as life sciences, materials science and medicine, according to the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute.
It has become a significant technological infrastructure with the highest number of beamlines, the widest coverage of energy range, and the most diverse experimental methods among third-generation medium-energy synchrotron radiation facilities worldwide, the institute said.
Gao Fu, a renowned Chinese immunologist and microbiologist who is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has nothing but praise for the facility.
""The Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility has played a significant role in my scientific research, the transformation of scientific research results into technology, and the conversion of technology into products. From my research on emerging infectious diseases and immunology, it has played a very important role in China's scientific development in the 21st century,"" he said.
In June 1962, Derek John de Solla Price, a scientist from the United States, proposed the concept of ""big science"". The characteristics of big science include grand goals, massive investments, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Big scientific facilities are essential infrastructure for contemporary scientific development, reflecting a country's or region's research capabilities.
China's construction of large scientific facilities can be traced back to the late 1970s with the building of the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider.
To advance high-energy physics, in 1972, 18 scientists including Zhang Wenyu and Zhu Hongyuan wrote a letter to then-premier Zhou Enlai.

At that time, high-energy physics experiments in China were almost nonexistent, and high-energy physics theoretical research relied entirely on foreign experimental data, according to records from the CAS.
Premier Zhou Enlai said: ""This matter cannot be delayed any longer. The academy of sciences must focus on basic science and theoretical research, while also integrating theoretical research with scientific experiments.""
In March 1981, scientists from the CAS met with physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, the director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the US, to discuss the construction of the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, which was unanimously considered the best development plan at the time.
After years of exploration, the collider was completed in 1988. Deng Xiaoping, China's late leader, at the inauguration ceremony, said, ""Whether in the past, present, or future, China must develop its own high technology and occupy a place in the world of high technology.""
Wang Yifang, the current director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, reflected: ""Looking back, constructing the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider was the best choice at the time. It allowed China's high-energy physics to take a place in the international high-energy physics field, cultivated a team with international standards, and also promoted the construction of other large scientific facilities in the country.""
The Beijing Electron-Positron Collider served dual purposes, and based on it, the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, the first generation synchrotron radiation light source, was built.
Soon after, in 1990, the second-generation synchrotron radiation light source, the Hefei Synchrotron Radiation Source, was built. Subsequently, in 2009, the medium-energy third-generation synchrotron radiation facility, the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, was completed.

The fourth-generation synchrotron radiation light source, the High Energy Photon Source, located in Beijing's Huairou Science City, is expected to be fully operational by the end of next year.
Once completed, it will be China's first high-energy light source and one of the brightest fourth-generation synchrotron radiation facilities in the world, emitting light 1 trillion times brighter than the sun, according to the Institute of High Energy Physics, which is part of the CAS.
The CAS currently has over 30 large scientific facilities in operation or under construction, including specialized research facilities for specific scientific and technological goals in certain disciplines, such as the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider and the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou.
There are also public experimental facilities serving multidisciplinary basic research, such as the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and the Hefei Synchrotron Radiation Source; as well as public technology facilities providing basic data, such as the China Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station and the BPL and BPM national time service systems.
According to the CAS, large scientific facilities in China play a strategic role in achieving high-level technological self-reliance, driving the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry, ensuring the security of industrial chains and supply chains, and promoting high-quality economic development.
Over the past few decades, under the country's unified deployment of relevant departments, the layout of major scientific and technological infrastructure in the country has gradually improved.

This has not only made outstanding contributions to addressing key bottlenecks in national development but has also significantly promoted socioeconomic development, according to the CAS.
Leveraging these facilities, a number of nationally influential scientific and technological innovation centers and talent hubs have gradually emerged on the international stage.
The Beijing Spectrometer III International Cooperation Group, based on China's large scientific facilities such as the Beijing Spectrometer III and the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, has attracted over 70 research institutions and more than 600 researchers from 18 countries and regions due to its leading research capabilities internationally.
The endeavor to develop large scientific facilities continues. This year, construction began on the Human Organ Physiopathology Emulation System, aiming to help scientists accurately simulate human physiological and pathological states, and analyze complex human functions and regulatory mechanisms, which is of great significance for life science research and biopharmaceutical development, according to the CAS.

BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- China's 2024 schedule of intense spacecraft launches will include the launch of a methane tracker -- a commercial satellite designed to monitor methane emissions worldwide.
Coded XIGUANG-004, the 75-kg satellite will carry multiple payloads, including a methane concentration detector and an imaging camera. These payloads are capable of identifying sources of methane emissions in coal mines, landfills, and oil and gas fields.
Scientists say it is important to monitor methane emissions as the colorless, odorless gas is the second-largest contributor to climate warming, after carbon dioxide.
""The duration of methane in the atmosphere is shorter than that of carbon dioxide, making it more urgent to reduce its emissions,"" said Liu Yi, director of the Carbon Neutrality Research Center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
According to Liu, scientific and technological methods can help reduce methane emissions in the short term, facilitating the utilization of otherwise wasted methane produced during coal and oil mining. Increasing the number of methane-monitoring satellites is also crucial for emissions cuts.
""One of the major challenges we are facing is that current satellites cannot provide sufficient global coverage, resulting in a lack of data,"" Liu said in a media interview.
The development of international standards for methane emissions is underway. With a sufficient number of satellites, it will become possible to effectively monitor the methane emissions of enterprises.
""If an enterprise exceeds the set emissions standards, it will be required to provide economic compensation for failing to do so,"" Liu said, explaining the role such satellites play in reducing methane emissions.

China has set the goals of peaking its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. This has been reinforced by its comprehensive approach to green and low-carbon development, and the new satellite is part of the efforts.
The satellite was developed by Xiopm Space, a commercial satellite maker in Xi'an, capital city of northwestern Shaanxi Province. The firm launched a satellite into space in August 2023, and it aims to develop a constellation of 108 hyperspectral satellites by 2030.
Qin Xiaobao, deputy director in charge of the company's data application, said that existing technology cannot efficiently and accurately monitor small-scale human-made emissions sources, also known as point sources. In China, the main point sources of methane gas emissions are coal mining, landfill sites, rice farming areas and livestock raising areas.
The new XIGUANG-004 satellite is capable of detecting methane leaks at such specific sources and evaluating the extent of those leakages in high spatial resolution, thus filling the gaps in existing technology, Qin said.
""With the help of this satellite, we can effectively monitor and track point source methane emissions worldwide,"" Qin added.

China unveiled on Tuesday its first-ever medium- and long-term plan for space science development, looking to establish itself as a ""global space science power"" by 2050.
The plan, which was jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China National Space Administration, and the China Manned Space Agency at a news conference held by the State Council Information Office, aims to achieve ""landmark original results with significant international impact"".
It outlines the development goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes. The themes include the extreme universe, the sun-Earth panoramic view, habitable planets, and biological and physical sciences in space, said Ding Chibiao, vice-president of the CAS.
China will explore the habitability of celestial bodies in the solar system and of exoplanets, as well as conduct missions to search for extraterrestrial life, Ding said, adding that the priority areas also include sustainable development, the origin and evolution of the solar system, and characterization of planetary atmospheres.
The key scientific questions to be addressed include the habitability and signs of extraterrestrial life on Mars, icy moons and ice giants, and exoplanets.
The plan outlined a three-phase road map leading to 2050.
By 2027, China intends to continuously secure world-class achievements in disciplines where it has a strong foundation and advantages, such as high-energy time-domain astronomy, the origin and evolution of the moon and Mars, and microgravity physics.
Additionally, it will consider implementing a series of space science missions in cutting-edge areas, including dark matter and extreme universe studies, gravitational waves, exoplanets, and solar activity. In these fields, five to eight missions will be proposed and initiated, with two to three major projects expected to deliver landmark results.
Between 2028 and 2035, China will deploy a range of space science missions, envisioning about 15 projects in frontier areas such as the early universe, nearby habitable exoplanets, early solar system exploration, and the search for extraterrestrial life.
During this phase, China will also continue operating the Tiangong space station, undertake feasibility studies for crewed lunar exploration and the establishment of an international lunar research station, and conduct approximately 15 space science satellite missions.
Between 2036 and 2050, China aims to achieve international leadership in critical fields, establishing itself as a ""global space science power"".
During the period, the country aspires to make ""revolutionary breakthroughs in basic research"" in areas such as the origin and evolution of the universe, the nature of space-time, the origins of the solar system and life, and crewed deep-space exploration, thereby ""expanding the boundaries of human knowledge and advancing human civilization"".
Meanwhile, China also plans to guide the global development of space science, proposing over 30 missions and positioning itself with core competitiveness and strong leadership in the next wave of the scientific and technological revolution.
Lunar missions
At the news conference, Yang Xiaoyu, director of the Department of System Engineering at the China National Space Administration, revealed more details about China's specific plans for future lunar exploration.
The Chang'e 7 robotic probe will investigate the environment and resources on the lunar south pole, while the Chang'e 8 robotic probe will carry out technological verification of in-situ resource utilization, he said, noting that the two missions will form the basis of the proposed international lunar research station.
Yang also shared the progress in research related to lunar samples brought back to Earth. In December 2020, Chang'e 5 brought back 1,731 grams of lunar soil, which he said is the ""youngest moon sample"" ever obtained.
Research has found that volcanic activity on the moon occurred as recently as 120 million years ago, and it has been discovered that the moon's cooling rate is much slower than previously thought, Yang said.
Scientists have identified a new mineral in the lunar samples and named it ""Chang'e Stone"", which is the sixth mineral ever discovered on the moon by mankind, he added.

SW China's Guizhou builds itself into computing power base serving whole country
By Chen Junyi (People's Daily) 15:20, October 15, 2024
At the Gui'an Supercomputing Center, which is located in Gui'an New Area, southwest China's Guizhou province, over 600 servers are running at full speed, supplying constant computing power to cities like Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, creating a vibrant ambiance with constant hum of cooling fans and flickering indicator lights.
As one of the eight major hubs of China's national integrated computing power network, Guizhou is actively pursuing the integrated development of data storage and computing, with a particular focus on intelligent computing.

It aims to enhance the capacity in computing power supply, effectively match the supply and demand of computing power within the province and elsewhere, and better utilize computing power and localize the computing industry, so as to establish a support base serving the whole country.
Guizhou launched its plans to develop data centers ten years ago. It boasts numerous natural advantages for developing the computing industry, such as safe geological conditions, reliable power supply, and low average temperatures. China's three telecommunication operators, namely China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom, have all set up data centers here, making it the first region in China to host data centers of all the three.
After a decade of development, Guizhou is currently home to 47 data centers, either under construction or in operation, including 25 super-large and large data centers, most of which are located in the Gui'an New Area.
The Gui'an New Area is known for its flat terrain and an annual average temperature of 15 degrees Celsius. The region enjoys 99.5 percent of days with good air quality throughout the year, thereby serving as a natural air conditioner and oxygen bar.
The power usage effectiveness (PUE) of data centers in the region, a metric for energy efficiency, is lower than 1.2, which is at the forefront of all green data centers across the country. It is also one of the areas in China where data centers boast the lowest energy consumption and the longest equipment lifespan.
""As the carrier of computing power, data centers are equipped to support high-performance application scenarios by leveraging advanced computational capabilities and large-scale data processing power through the use of various hardware components such as servers and graphics cards,"" said Peng Benqian, head of the Gui'an Supercomputing Center and director of the technology research and development department of Gui'an New Area Science and Technology Innovation Industries Development Co., Ltd., the company that runs the center.

In the past, most data centers in Guizhou were primarily focused on storage. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), Guizhou is advancing intelligent computing, which forms the basis of AI development. The data centers are rapidly transforming from mere ""storage centers"" to integrated ""storage and computing ones.""
The Gui'an Supercomputing Center, the first of its kind in Guizhou, was put into operation at the end of 2020. ""We have more than 600 servers, and the peak computing power has reached 130 petaflops,"" Peng said.
""It would take nearly 600 years to create special effects rendering for a 3D animated film with a regular computer. However, the whole process can be completed within 3 months at our center,"" he said.
In addition to locally built computing power centers, top internet companies such as Huawei, Tencent, and NetEase have established superlarge computing centers and intelligent computing centers in Guizhou. Besides, many banks have set up their financial data centers in the province.
Guizhou has become one of the regions in China with the strongest intelligent computing capabilities. By the end of July 2024, its computing power had reached 40.55 Eflops (a measurement unit used to determine a computer's speed), with intelligent computing power amounting to 37.578 Eflops, accounting for over 90 percent.
Just like other commodities, computing power cannot be on a perfect supply-demand balance. Idle computing resources will enter a public computing resource pool and be scheduled by the Guizhou branch of China's national integrated computing power network to efficiently connect the resource side and the demand side.

The transmission and trading of computing power rely on network infrastructure. Guizhou has established direct connections with 38 cities across China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. The computing power can meet the huge demand of the ""east data, west computing"" project, a key part of China's digital infrastructure which aims to coordinate the computing capabilities of the country's eastern regions, where the need for computing is high, with inland western regions like Guizhou, where abundant renewable resources are optimal for building data centers, according to Zhang Jie, head of the business department of Gui'an New Area Data Service Technology Co., Ltd.
Meanwhile, Guizhou is leveraging its computing power to drive industrial development and extend the industrial chain. With the support of computing power, many local companies have begun to explore new opportunities.
Guizhou Tuzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd. is a technology company specializing in geospatial big data application and development and a professional provider of real-time spatial-temporal information services integrating air, space, and ground data. With over 8 years of experience, the company has witnessed the evolution of Guizhou's big data industry.
""The ecosystem of the big data industry in Guizhou is getting better and better, with refined computing power support, industry applications and data transactions. We have seen increasing productivity and expanding business scope,"" said Huang Yong, president of the company.

BEIJING, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- The China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec Group), the country's largest oil refiner, has announced that its Shengli Oilfield, driven by technology breakthroughs, has set a new record for single-well daily shale oil production in China.
A total of 94 horizontal shale oil wells have been built in the Jiyang shale oil national demonstration zone owned by the Shengli Oilfield in east China's Shandong Province since it was established two years ago, among which 36 wells have achieved peak daily oil production exceeding 100 tonnes, with a maximum of 262.8 tonnes for a single well, the Science and Technology Daily reported on Saturday.
The achievements were made with the driving force of technology innovations, according to Yang Yong, general manager of the Sinopec Shengli Oilfield.
Shale oil mainly refers to liquid hydrocarbons that are trapped in formations of shale rock that can be extracted for refining. It is often found in organic-rich shale and thin interlayers of carbonate rocks, sandstones, and siltstones.
China has abundant shale oil resources, but they are mainly continental shale oil, making exploration and production difficult.
Compared with the shale oil reserves in North America, those in Jiyang are buried deeper and have lower maturity, posing a series of challenges to exploration and development, said Yang.
The technology innovation team of the Shengli Oilfield overcame difficulties in exploration such as high temperature, high pressure, and simultaneous seepage in shale oil reservoirs.
They have developed a fast drilling technology centered on synthetic-based drilling fluid systems, enabling efficient drilling of horizontal wells with depths exceeding 3,300 meters and horizontal sections longer than 2,000 meters.
