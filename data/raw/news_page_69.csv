2023 Yearender: China's commercial space industry delivers unprecedented progress,2023-12-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1229/c90000-20116235.html,"Home>>
		
2023 Yearender: China's commercial space industry delivers unprecedented progress
By Deng Xiaoci and Fan Anqi (Global Times) 08:41, December 29, 2023
China's commercial space industry has experienced a year of robust and all-around advancement in 2023, which has been lauded by industry insiders and observers as a prominent feature of China's overall development of its space program, with the unprecedentedly rapid emergence of private space companies a particular highlight.
As of December 15, China's space program had conducted 17 space launch activities related to commercial spaceflight this year, which included launches for commercial carrier rockets and various types of commercial satellites.
As Chinese President Xi Jinping called for nurturing strategic emerging industries including biological manufacturing, commercial space industry and the low-altitude economy at the annual Central Economic Work Conference on December 12, the booming progress of the private space companies is injecting confidence into the country's commercial space endeavors as it heads into its ninth year since 2015.
Year of breakthroughs
CERES-1, built by Beijing-based start-up Galactic Energy, has dramatically increased its launch frequency from four launches in three years to at least seven launches in a single year, including one ocean-based launch, successfully sending around 20 satellites into space in 2023. This small solid-fuel commercial carrier rocket, first successfully launched in November 2020, has rapidly become a force in China's commercial rocket sector following years of intensive development.
In July, another milestone was achieved by Beijing-based private space company, Landspace, with the successful launch of the Zhuque-2 rocket. The flight marked the world's first successful payload delivery into a preset orbit by a liquid oxygen-methane rocket, signifying a major breakthrough in China's use of new, low-cost liquid propellants.
In December, Zhuque-2 continued its success, smoothly completing a mission to launch three satellites in one launch. During a post-launch press conference, the company announced that its new reusable rocket model, Zhuque-3, is scheduled to undertake its maiden flight in 2025.
What's more, several other private space companies have successfully launched rockets this year, including the Tianlong-2 of Beijing-based Space Pioneer, SQX-1 of Bejing start-up iSpace, and Lijian-1 built by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
Galaxy Space, a commercial aerospace company based in Beijing, has developed and successfully launched a new type of satellite, designed for stacking multiple satellites in a flat-panel configuration. On July 23, 2023, the company launched a satellite codenamed ""Lingxi-03"" into preset orbit.
This satellite is China's first to utilize flexible solar wings. These ""flexible wings"" have several advantages: they are compact, lightweight, and modular, making them easier to store. With the same mass, they have a larger surface area to absorb more solar energy. This feature is particularly beneficial for simultaneously launching a large number of satellites, playing a crucial role in accelerating the construction of satellite internet infrastructure, the company told the Global Times exclusively in December.
Currently performing well in orbit, the Lingxi-03 satellite is validating a range of technologies essential for next-generation LEO broadband satellite communication. These include high-capacity energy generation, active thermal control, integrated industrial manufacturing structures, and multi-satellite stack compression release mechanisms.
Its successful deployment is providing crucial technological support for the rapid establishment of China's massive low Earth orbit communication constellation, marking a significant stride forward in the country's efforts to expand its space-based communication capabilities. This development not only demonstrates China's growing expertise in satellite technology but also represents a leap forward in its quest to establish a robust and efficient satellite internet system, the company said.
Moreover, China's national space team has expanded its presence in the commercial rocket field too, with the country's major space contractors China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) leading multiple commercial satellite launches with their main models, the Long March 2D and the Kuaizhou-1A, respectively.
With multiple participants engaged in friendly competition, China's commercial rocket sector is demonstrating increasing vitality and robust growth.
Promising potential
Kang Guohua, Professor of Aerospace Engineering at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, summarized China's commercial space development in 2023 under three themes: wide application, full-chain development, and low Earth orbit (LEO).
Kang told the Global Times that he has been impressed this year by the resilience of the commercial space industry.
""There is also a major breakthrough in applications, such as Huawei's launch of direct-to-satellite smartphones, which has truly brought the commercial space industry into the public eye. Previously, there was a misconception that there is little demand for commercial spaceflight, and this case has allowed people to see the huge potential of satellite internet,"" Kang noted.
The other highlight for this year's commercial space development is the advancement of a comprehensive industrial chain, from upstream industries including satellite manufacturing and rocket production, to downstream industries including various applications and services.
Kang specifically mentioned the construction of rocket launch sites by local governments. Previously, these resources were solely controlled by the military, but now they are being opened up for civilian use, reflecting the emergence of a holistic space ecosystem.
For example, Space Pioneer told the Global Times in an exclusive interview in July that the firm has built its own launch site at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, and its own rocket manufacturing and assembly center in Zhangjiagang, East China's Jiangsu Province, in a move to greatly boost the efficiency of assembly, testing and launch.
China's first commercial spacecraft launch site in Wenchang, South China's Hainan Province, is ramping up the final stages of construction, and plans to commence normalized commercial launch operations in 2024, the Global Times reported in July.
Shanghai is also aiming to foster a complete industrial chain for commercial rocket production, with an annual production capacity of 50 commercial rockets and 600 commercial satellites by 2025, according to an official plan released in October.
LEO ambitions
What's more, China's commercial space exploration has made significant progress in low Earth orbit, or LEO, activities.
This trend is described by experts as ""a step forward for the civilian field,"" indicating that as civilian space exploration advances in the low Earth orbit space, the focus of state efforts may gradually shift to higher orbits.
This aligns with the global trend of technology development, where countries invest substantial funds in exploring a specific field and subsequently transfer the technology to the civilian sector, Kang said.
In 2023, one of the most notable commercial satellite companies in China is Changguang Satellite Technology Co based in Northeast China's Jilin Province. In June, the company successfully launched 41 satellites in a single mission.
This feat advanced the development of the Jilin-1 satellite constellation, significantly enhancing its capabilities. The constellation now offers high quality remote sensing information and products for various sectors, including national security, geographic surveying, land planning, agriculture, forestry, environmental protection, and smart cities.
Furthermore, in July, the Jilin-based firm, in partnership with the Aerospace Information Research Institute of the CAS, conducted a successful experiment in high-speed laser communication between satellites and ground stations. This experiment laid the foundation for expanding China's space-to-ground communication systems from microwave to laser technologies.
In the realm of constructing LEO communication satellite constellations, a field that has seen a significant rise in activity this year, both national and commercial entities have made substantial progress.
Outstanding major projects include the state-led Hongyun, Hongyan programs, and Xingwang, as well as commercial ventures including the Tianqi constellation.
On September 5, a new grouping of satellites for the Tianqi constellation were successfully launched into orbit. As per the plan, this constellation aims to establish a low-Earth orbit satellite Internet of Things (IoT) network, comprising 38 satellites and several ground stations, to create an integrated space-terrestrial IoT ecosystem.
For Deng Zhongliang, an academician from the International Eurasian Academy of Sciences and Professor at the School of Electronic Engineering of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, the great leap of commercialization in space this year would be the satellite internet.
Satellite internet refers to a satellite communication system that can provide broadband access services. The unique advantage of it is that satellite internet is able to fill the coverage gaps in mountainous areas, plateaus, deserts, airspace, and oceans where ground-based mobile internet is insufficient.
Due to the huge potential of commercial applications of satellite internet, it has become one of the most important directions for international competition in the field.
China, in this regard, is working on integrating the 5G ground-based internet with the satellite internet powered by China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, and this innovation has made China leading global research and development works, thus promoting the rapid growth of a variety of new commercial aerospace applications, Deng said.
What's more, in order to further reduce costs, a number of new technologies need to enhanced, including the feasibility of rocket recovery, breakthroughs in key components, and the capability of launching multiple satellites with a single rocket. This year, a series of experiments have been conducted, with significant progress made in China's commercial space sector, which Deng believed marked ""a big step forward.""
The robust development in satellite technology and deployment underscores China's growing prowess in the global space industry, space experts and industry insiders hailed.
The advancements in satellite constellations, particularly in remote sensing and communication, highlight the country's commitment to enhancing its capabilities in space-based technologies. These efforts not only bolster China's technological infrastructure but also offer valuable services and data to a wide array of industries, marking a significant step forward in the nation's journey to becoming a leading space power, they noted.

Huawei revs up NEV sector with new SUV
By Ma Si (China Daily) 08:32, December 27, 2023
Chinese tech giant aiming at cutting-edge autonomous driving features amid stiff rivalry
Huawei Technologies Co showcased its technological muscle in its latest SUV model on Tuesday, as the Chinese company aims to bring cutting-edge autonomous driving features to more cars amid stiff competition.
Huawei's efforts for new growth engines in the face of prolonged restrictions imposed by the United States have progressed further with its sustained push for the burgeoning new energy vehicle sector, experts said.
Yu Chengdong, head of Huawei's smart vehicle business unit, said at a product launch event in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, that it took three years for Huawei and Chinese carmaker Seres to codevelop the new Aito M9 SUV.
Yu said the Aito M9 features high-level autonomous driving technologies such as self-navigation on urban roads and expressways without reliance on high-definition maps, which are often considered a must for autonomous driving.
For long-haul trips, the system requires one manual intervention per 200 kilometers, and on urban roads, it can maneuver itself through fast traffic just like seasoned drivers, Yu said.
This is achieved in part by the vehicle's combination of 27 sensors, including high-definition cameras and lidar — a detection system that works like radar but uses laser light — to detect objects more accurately and swiftly, Huawei said.
Artificial intelligence technologies and object-detection networks are also leveraged to support high-level autonomous driving.
""Starting from the end of December, users will be able to turn on the M9's high-level autonomous driving functions when they are on urban roads and expressways across China,"" Yu said, adding that Huawei has already received 54,000 preorders for the SUV.
Donghai Securities said in a research note that autonomous driving technologies are entering a phase of rapid growth in China, as tech giants such as Huawei and auto startups such as Nio and Li Auto are bringing more advanced driving assistance systems to cars.
Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said there is enough room for the development of smart cars in the 5G era. Huawei can offer a slew of technological solutions and services covering both hardware and software.
Cui said that China's NEV sales in 2023 will reach the association's estimated figure of 8.5 million units, as many automakers — both startups and established companies — experience growing momentum.
Huawei's launch of its new model follows its splash in the NEV sector earlier this year. In November, more than 18,800 Aito vehicles were sold, up 127 percent year-on-year.
Last month, Huawei announced it would move its smart vehicle technologies and solutions into a joint venture with Chinese carmaker Changan, which will hold a stake of up to 40 percent in the joint venture.
Huawei said the equity stakes in the new joint venture will also be open to its existing partners and others of potential strategic value. Huawei has been codeveloping models with brands such as BAIC, JAC and Chery.
Zhong Shi, an independent auto analyst, said that Huawei has so far adopted two strategies to involve itself in the auto supply chain. One is for the supply of parts and technologies to automakers, like its cooperation with Changan.
""The other is the intelligent car selection mode. Huawei not only participates in product modeling, interior designing and intelligent solutions, but also is responsible for the marketing and sales of cars. A typical example is its cooperation with Seres, which has proved to be highly successful,"" Zhong said.

XICHANG, Dec. 26 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday sent two new satellites for the BeiDou-3 Navigation Satellite System (BDS-3) into space successfully from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
The two satellites, the 57th and 58th satellites of the BeiDou system, were launched at 11:26 a.m. (Beijing Time) by a Long March-3B carrier rocket and the Yuanzheng-1 (Expedition-1) upper stage attached to the carrier rocket.
They are the first medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites launched since BDS-3 was formally commissioned to provide satellite navigation services worldwide. After entering their orbit and completing in-orbit tests, they will be connected to the BeiDou system.
Compared to previous MEO satellites of the BeiDou system, the newly launched satellites have upgraded functions and performance in various areas, including global short message communication capacity, onboard atomic clock technology, and intelligent payloads.
They will upgrade the reliability and service capabilities of the BeiDou system. They will also lay the foundation for the development of next-generation BDS satellites.
The launch was the 504th mission for the Long March series carrier rockets.
The satellites and launch vehicle were respectively developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) and the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, both of which are affiliated with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
The two satellites will play multiple roles by effectively expanding the communication capacity of BeiDou's global short messages, upgrading the performance monitoring of the integrity of its navigation signals globally, and more, said Xie Jun, deputy chief designer of the BDS.
On July 31, 2020, China commissioned BDS officially, opening BDS-3 to global users, making China the third country around the world to have an independent global navigation satellite system.

Global greenhouse gas reduction in paper industry requires diverse strategies: study
 (Xinhua) 10:54, December 26, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of researchers have assessed the net global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of domestic paper-related industries across 30 major countries from 1961 to 2019 and found significant differences in terms of historical emission evolution trends and structures in these countries, according to a recent study published in the journal Nature.
The pulp and paper industry is an important contributor to GHG emissions. Country-specific strategies are essential for the industry to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, given its vast heterogeneities across countries, the study noted.
Researchers from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering of Fudan University cooperated with international partners to set up a greenhouse gas emissions dataset concerning the paper industry and proposed a strategy to reach net-zero emission by 2050, which took into account the local conditions of countries.
The research showed that the global paper industry had emitted 43.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases from 1961 to 2019.
Net greenhouse gas emissions of the paper industry globally showed a tendency to rise first and then decline or stabilize.
All countries are expected to achieve net-zero emissions for their pulp and paper industries by 2050, with a single measure used for most developed countries and multiple measures employed for the majority of developing countries, according to the study.
The results of scenario analysis showed that improvements in both energy structures and energy efficiency are effective measures to reduce emissions, and which can achieve average emission reductions of 64 percent and 41 percent, respectively, across the 30 countries studied.

Experts hail lawsuit settlement between chipmakers
By Ma Si (China Daily) 08:10, December 26, 2023
United States-based chip producer Micron Technology has settled an intellectual property lawsuit with Chinese memory chip maker Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co, a move that experts said can pave the way for the positive development of both companies in the future.
The comments came after a Micron spokeswoman said in a statement that ""the two companies will each globally dismiss their complaints against the other party and end all lawsuits between them"".
Roger Sheng, vice-president of research at US market research company Gartner Inc, said that a global settlement agreement between Micron and Fujian Jinhua can create a better development environment for both companies in the future.
The move also shows that Micron is committed to the Chinese market and is making efforts to revive its business in the country, Sheng said.
After South Korean chip companies Samsung and SK Hynix, Micron is the world's third-largest maker of dynamic random access memory chips, which are flash memory semiconductors widely used in smartphones, personal computers and servers.
The Chinese mainland is a big market for Micron, accounting for around 11 percent of the company's $30.8 billion global sales in 2022, according to its financial report.
The dispute between Micron and Fujian Jinhua had been going on for years. In 2017, Micron sued Fu-jian Jinhua and the latter's partner United Microelectronics Corp. Fu-jian Jinhua did not respond to requests for comments on the settlement.
In November, Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron, visited Beijing and met China's Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao. Wang said during the meeting that China welcomes Micron to continue to take root in and deeply cultivate the Chinese market, and achieve better development while complying with Chinese laws and regulations.
Mehrotra expressed a willingness at the meeting to continue expanding investments in China.
The meeting came after Micron said in June that it would invest about 4.3 billion yuan ($600 million) in its chip packaging plant in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, as part of its long-term commitment to the Chinese market.
Micron said part of the planned investment will go toward the purchase of packaging equipment from a Xi'an-based subsidiary of Powertech Technology, which Micron has been using in the factory since 2016.
Micron said it would offer job contracts to 1,200 employees of Powertech's Xi'an subsidiary and that the investment would create an additional 500 jobs. This would bring Micron's workforce on the Chinese mainland to more than 4,500.
Before the announcement of the investment plan, the Cyberspace Administration of China had said in May that products of Micron sold in China had not passed a recent cybersecurity review, and operators of the country's key information infrastructure should stop purchasing its products.
Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association in Beijing, said this is also good news for the development of China's memory chip industry, as Fujian Jinhua can be an important player in producing memory chips.
The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics has forecast the size of China's memory chip market to hit 650 billion yuan ($91 billion) in 2023. In comparison, the global size of the memory chip market is expected to stand at $165.8 billion.

Chinese researchers develop thermal fibers mimicking polar bear fur
 (Xinhua) 15:56, December 25, 2023
HANGZHOU, Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in east China's Zhejiang Province have developed an ultra-warm, lightweight and durable aerogel fiber by mimicking the structure of polar bear fur.
Scientists from Zhejiang University's College of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the Department of Polymer Science and Engineering were involved in this research.
Polar bears have fur that has a porous core encapsulated in a dense shell, a structure that keeps the animals warm and dry at even minus 40 degrees Celsius but is relatively lightweight, said Bai Hao, a leading professor in chemical and biological engineering, adding that the shell is about 20 micrometers, which is nearly one-fourth of the bear's hair diameter.
By mimicking the core-shell structure, scientists encapsulated the aerogel fiber with a stretchable layer, providing possibilities for developing multifunctional aerogel fibers and textiles.
Compared with traditional aerogel fibers, the strength and flexibility of the new fiber are greatly enhanced, allowing for weaving or knitting into a wearable fabric. Tests show that a sweater knitted with the fiber was roughly one-third to one-fifth as thick as a down jacket, with similar performance, Bai added.
The study was published in the journal Science in December.
