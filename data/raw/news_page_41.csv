BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) --China's Einstein Probe (EP) astronomical satellite, sent into space in January this year, has captured its first in-orbit detection images, which were presented at a parallel forum of the 2024 Zhongguancun Forum in Beijing on Saturday.
Inspired by the functions of lobster eyes, EP uses new X-ray detection technology to observe mysterious transient phenomena in the universe that flicker like fireworks.
Yuan Weimin, principal investigator of the EP mission and a researcher at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that since the probe's launch on Jan. 9 this year, commissioning tests have been conducted, confirming the functionality and performance of the EP satellite and its scientific instruments.
During its commissioning phase, EP has detected 17 X-ray transients and 127 stellar flares. These findings have guided a range of ground-based and space-based telescopes in follow-up observations in multiple wavebands, Yuan said.
Preliminary analysis of the data from EP and other telescopes has confirmed EP's potential to discover diverse X-ray sources and even new types of objects, and its important role in unveiling the evolution of the universe and the structure of spacetime, Yuan added.
""With great efforts, our team made this almost impossible mission possible,"" Yuan said.
Zhang Chen, assistant to EP's principal investigator, said that the probe has captured X-ray images of various celestial bodies during its commissioning phase. These observations have demonstrated the outstanding capabilities of EP's two scientific instruments: a Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) to monitor a panorama of the X-ray sky, and a Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) to provide close-up views and pinpoint transient sources captured by the WXT.
EP will continue its in-orbit calibration activities in the coming months, Zhang added.
The EP mission is one of a series of space science missions led by CAS. It is also an international collaboration mission with contributions from the European Space Agency (ESA), the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Germany, and the French space agency CNES.
The mission aims to help scientists capture the first light of supernova explosions, search for and pinpoint X-ray signals accompanying gravitational wave events, and discover dormant black holes and other faint transient and variable celestial objects in the far reaches of the universe.

Australian, Chinese researchers make breakthrough in fighting wheat disease
 (Xinhua) 16:48, April 26, 2024
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian and Chinese researchers have made a breakthrough in the fight against a devastating wheat disease.
In a new research, a team from the University of Adelaide in collaboration with the Nanjing Agriculture University found that the cereal crop gene TaHRC can increase or decrease a plant's susceptibility to the fungal disease Fusarium head blight (FHB).
Yang Xiujuan, a co-author of the research from the University of Adelaide's School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, said she is hopeful that the discovery of TaHRC's function in wheat cells could counteract a rise in the prevalence of FHB.
It was previously unknown why some types of wheat are resistant to FHB.
Yang said the research found there are two variants of TaHRC, one that increases susceptibility to FHB by condensing a specific protein within the nucleus of a wheat cell, and the other one that reduces susceptibility by diffusing the same protein.
""Our findings offer exciting prospects for developing new and enhanced forms of Fusarium head blight resistance,"" Yang said in a media release.
""Our research opens the door to the development of more resilient and sustainable wheat varieties for future agriculture, and might shed light onto other Fusarium-caused diseases, such as crown rot.""
Also known as scab or tombstone, FHB is a serious disease that affects wheat, barley, oats, corn and other cereal grains. An outbreak in eastern Australia in 2022 caused crops to suffer yield losses of up to 100 percent.
According to the study, climate change has driven a rise in the prevalence of FHB globally since the 1970s due to increasingly humid conditions during the wheat growing season.

Chinese scientists fabricate wearable batteries that can charge cellphone
 (Xinhua) 14:38, April 26, 2024
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has developed a soft and breathable piece of clothing that can not only store energy but also power personal electronic devices such as smartphones and watches.
Replacing conventional liquid electrolytes with polymer gel electrolytes is a highly effective strategy for enhancing the flexibility of wearable batteries.
However, the inadequate wetting at the interface between the polymer gel electrolyte and the electrode degrades the electrochemical performance, particularly when the battery undergoes deformation.
The researchers from Fudan University have crafted channel structures within electrode designs, an innovative approach that creates intimate and stable interfaces, thereby enhancing the performance and reliability of wearable batteries.
They have drawn inspiration from the natural phenomenon where ivy and plant vines are tightly entwined to form multiple electrode fibers rotated together to form aligned channels. The surface of each electrode fiber was designed with networked channels.
According to the study published this week in the journal Nature, the monomer solution was then infiltrated along the aligned channels and then into the networked channels to form a gel electrolyte.
The team managed to fabricate fiber lithium-ion batteries with lengths of several kilometers and a high energy density that can effectively provide power for electrical devices like drones.
They have established a pilot production line and achieved a production capacity of 300 watt-hours per hour, which is equivalent to the battery produced per hour capable of charging 20 mobile phones simultaneously, said Peng Huisheng, the paper's corresponding author.
This fiber battery shows promise for applications in firefighting, disaster relief, polar expeditions, and aerospace, added Peng.

WUHAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Mechanical arms and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) operated by a digital manufacturing control system can be seen throughout a satellite production workshop in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province.
The facility is home to China's first intelligent production line for small satellites. Located in the Wuhan satellite industrial park, it was built by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC).
The production line was put into operation in 2021, producing more than 10 satellites to date.
Based on intelligent manufacturing technology, the production line has high flexibility and efficiency, and is of high quality, capable of meeting the demand for both individually produced and mass-produced small satellites.
It now has an annual output of more than 200 small satellites weighing less than 1 tonne, a storage capacity of 60 satellite parts and 60 whole satellites, and a logistics distribution automation rate of over 95 percent, which greatly improves production efficiency and quality.
The rapid development of commercial satellites and satellite constellation construction has brought high demand for mass-produced satellites.
CASIC provides customized services, including the entire satellite development and production process, mass production and testing, and services for satellite users at home and abroad.
It successfully completed the final-assembly tests of 12 satellites for the Tianmu constellation in approximately four months last year, shortening the production cycle of a single batch of satellites by more than 13.5 percent.
The successful delivery of these satellites tested the production capacity of the assembly line in full, marking its transformation from individual production to mass production, and marking the maturity of commercial space operations.
CASIC's digital assembly production line project passed review in March 2024. The new line integrates assembly, testing, warehousing and logistics, management and control, and information technology, aiming to realize the large-scale production of satellites.
Intelligent satellite production lines have effectively improved aircraft production capacities and quality control capabilities, and promoted the transformation and intelligent upgrading of aircraft.

Research team from China's Zhejiang University enables brain-controlled robotic arm to write Chinese characters for first time
 (People's Daily Online) 10:10, April 26, 2024
A brain-computer interface research team from Zhejiang University in China has achieved a first by successfully enabling a robotic arm controlled by the mind through an invasive brain-computer interface to write Chinese characters.
The team's latest research achievement was released on Tuesday at the Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine (SAHZU) in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
During the release event, the research team operated a robotic arm that smoothly wrote Chinese characters meaning ""Zhejiang University"" and ""Brain-Computer Interface"" based on brain signal data previously extracted from a male patient surnamed Zhang.

""Some stroke survivors and patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) lose their writing and speaking abilities. But by extracting their brain signals to control external mechanical devices, they can write out what they want to say and communicate with the outside world. This is a major breakthrough,"" said Zhang Jianmin, director of the neurosurgery department of SAHZU.
The research team has been conducting pioneering interdisciplinary research into brain-computer interfaces since 2006.
In 2012, it achieved the breakthrough of decoding brain signals for precise hand gestures such as hooking, grasping, pinching, and gripping for the first time by implanting electrodes in the motor cortex of a monkey.
In 2014, the team completed the first domestic clinical trial of implanting electrodes into a patient's skull and successfully decoding brain signals for hand motions used in the rock-paper-scissors game.
In 2020, the research team successfully enabled a senior clinical volunteer to use an invasive brain-controlled robotic arm to complete tasks including drinking water, eating, and shaking hands. The experiment marked a first in China.
The team's latest focus is brain-controlled Chinese character writing. With this technology, patients only need to think about the normal writing process and the robotic arm can obtain information about the writing trajectory in their minds by decoding neural signals and then write for them.
Despite facing various challenges, the team has developed a unique encoding mechanism for Chinese character writing as well as a new technology for decoding the Chinese character writing trajectory.
The team's device can achieve a 91.3-percent accuracy in classifying 100 common Chinese characters offline. With the assistance of a language model, it can achieve online classification accuracy of 96.2 percent.
""The road ahead for brain-computer interface is still long. When the hardware becomes smaller, less invasive, and 'wireless,' we can implant it into some paralyzed patients or patients with ALS to help them perform previously impossible functions, such as controlling an exoskeleton for walking or a robotic arm for daily assistance,"" said Zhu Junming, deputy head of the neurosurgery department of SAHZU.

JIUQUAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday launched the Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship to send three taikonauts to its orbiting Tiangong space station for a six-month mission.
The spaceship, atop a Long March-2F carrier rocket, blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.
The Shenzhou-18 crew members are Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, with Ye as the mission commander, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
The Shenzhou-18 mission marks Ye's second journey into space, following his previous role as a crew member during the Shenzhou-13 mission from October 2021 to April 2022. Li Cong and Li Guangsu are both on their first-ever space adventure.
SPACE ""AQUARIUM"" AND ""GARDEN""
The crew will utilize the scientific experiment cabinets and extravehicular payloads to carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material science, space life science, space medicine and space technology, said Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA, at Wednesday's press conference.
A unique task for the three pilot-turned taikonauts is to create an ""aquarium"" and raise fish in zero gravity.
They will create a simplified version of an aquatic ecosystem using zebrafish and algae to study how the space environment affects their growth and system balance.
The ""aquarium"" is 1.25 liters in volume and can accommodate four small fish. But if the experiment succeeds, it will be a significant breakthrough to cultivate vertebrates in China's space program. Not only will the taikonauts find joy in the space ""aquarium,"" but it may also pave the way for their future counterparts to enjoy nutritious fish from their own in-orbit harvests.
""The next step in our research involves conducting experiments on fruit flies and mice,"" said Cang Huaixing, a chief researcher for the space station's scientific experiments, at the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Taikonauts in orbit will also be involved in an experiment of cultivating plants. The purpose is to analyze the changes in the function and gene expression of plant stem cells in a microgravity environment. According to scientists, this research will provide theoretical support for designing crops that can adapt to outer space conditions.
More than 100 Arabidopsis seeds will be grown and nurtured in space for approximately four weeks. The crew aboard the space station will freeze them at minus 80 degrees Celsius in real-time and bring them back to Earth for further analysis and research.
In addition to the two experiments related to fish and plant, the crew will also conduct molecular research on the co-origin of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as the origin of codons. Furthermore, they will test a newly developed spacecraft coating material.

China launches 504-qubit quantum chip, open to global users
 (Xinhua) 09:02, April 26, 2024
HEFEI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has delivered a 504-qubit superconducting quantum computing chip to QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., a leading quantum company based in east China's Anhui Province, setting a record for the number of qubits in a superconducting quantum chip in China, QuantumCTek said on Thursday.
The chip, ""Xiaohong,"" is used to verify the kilo-qubit measurement and control system independently developed by the company, according to QuantumCTek.
The measurement and control system and the quantum computing chip are the core hardware of quantum computers, and the measurement and control system will greatly influence the overall performance of quantum computers, said Liang Futian, an associate professor at the center.
Liang said that the chip's key indicators, including the lifetime of its qubits, its gate fidelity and the depth of its quantum circuit, are expected to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM.
Gong Ming, a researcher at the center, said that the main purpose of the chip is to promote the development of large-scale quantum computing measurement and control systems, rather than to aim for higher computing power and quantum supremacy.
""Jiuzhang 2.0,"" which has 113 detected photons, and the ""Zuchongzhi 2.1"" 66-qubit programmable superconducting quantum computing systems developed by Chinese scientists in 2021, have made China the only country to achieve a quantum computational advantage through two mainstream technical routes: one via photonics quantum computing technology, and the other via superconducting quantum computing technology.
Wang Zhen, deputy general manager of China Telecom Quantum Group, a quantum computing company with investment from China Telecom, said that the company will cooperate with QuantumCTek to develop a quantum computer with the new ""Xiaohong"" chip, which global users will have access to through a quantum computing cloud platform developed by China Telecom Quantum Group.
""It will allow users in various fields to conduct research on problems and algorithms of practical value efficiently, and accelerate the application of quantum computing in actual scenarios,"" Wang said.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The NeuCyber Array BMI System, a self-developed brain-machine interface (BMI) system from China, was unveiled at the opening ceremony of the 2024 Zhongguancun Forum (ZGC Forum) on Thursday in Beijing.
At the forum, a video demonstration revealed a remarkable feat: a monkey with its hands restrained and soft electrode filaments implanted in its brain, controlled an isolated robotic arm and grasped a strawberry by simply using its ""thoughts.""
The NeuCyber Array BMI System fills the gap in high-performance invasive brain-machine interface technology in China, said Luo Minmin, director of the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing, which co-developed the system with NeuCyber NeuroTech (Beijing) Co., Ltd.
The BMI serves as the ""information highway"" for the brain, facilitating communication with external devices and providing cutting-edge technologies in human-machine interaction and hybrid intelligence, Luo said.
""In short, the technology captures the subtle changes of electrical signals from neurons and decodes the brain's intentions, to realize 'thoughts' control 'actions',"" he said.
The NeuCyber Array BMI System is composed of three major components -- high-throughput flexible microelectrode array, a thousand-channel high-speed neural signal acquisition system, and a generative neural decoding algorithm based on a feedforward control mechanism.
The electrodes determine the quality of the recorded brain signals and the accuracy of ""brain control,"" said Li Yuan, business development director of NeuCyber NeuroTech (Beijing) Co., Ltd. The NeuCyber Array BMI System makes use of a large number of electrode contacts on a thin electrode thread to enhance signal capture ability.
The electrode filaments made of flexible materials needed to be viewed under a microscope, said Li. The material, which boasts high biocompatibility and no cytotoxicity, fits well with brain tissue.
""Both its number of effective channels and long-term stability are up to the international state of the art,"" Li said. ""Different from stiff electrodes, the flexible microelectrode array can still effectively record brain signals after one year of implantation in the brain of macaque monkeys.""
The generative neural decoding algorithm based on the feedforward control mechanism of the system can establish an accurate mapping between neural activity in the cerebral cortex and motion parameters.
""BMI system focuses on safety, stability and effectiveness. It's a systematic project,"" said Luo, adding that the invasive BMI has a long chain of development, involving multiple technologies such as electrodes, chips, algorithms, software, and materials. There is still a long way in technological refinement and iteration.
Founded in 2007, the ZGC Forum, with its enduring focus on innovation and development, has evolved into a national-level open innovation platform and an international forum over the years.

Greater efforts are needed to strengthen international cooperation in science and technology, explore ways of jointly solving important global issues through technological innovation, and develop new quality productive forces, said officials, experts and company executives on Thursday in Beijing.
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 2024 Zhongguancun Forum, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang said that China is willing to work with the international community to practice the concept of open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory international science and technology cooperation, and to jointly build a global sci-tech community.
The country will explore a new model regarding mutually beneficial global cooperation in sci-tech innovation, and will break down barriers restricting the flow of knowledge, technology, talent and other innovative factors, in order to jointly create an open innovation ecosystem.
Ding also emphasized the significance of jointly cultivating and developing new quality productive forces, while calling for efforts to expand cooperation in fields such as artificial intelligence, life sciences, green energy and advanced manufacturing, as well as strengthen international cooperation on the digital economy.
Yin Li, secretary of the Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal Committee, said the capital will ramp up efforts to improve its innovation capacities, accelerate the building of world-leading science and technology parks, increase investment in basic research and make breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields.
Data from the Ministry of Science and Technology showed that China's research and development investment exceeded 3.3 trillion yuan ($455.4 billion) in 2023, up 8.1 percent year-on-year, and the spending on fundamental research reached 221.2 billion yuan, an increase of 9.3 percent over the previous year.
China's strength in scientific and technological innovation has taken a major leap in recent years. Marco Aleman, assistant director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization, said China is a powerhouse of innovation that contributes to global growth and sustainable development.
According to the WIPO, the country stands as a global innovation leader, ranking 12th in the Global Innovation Index 2023, and it owned 24 of the top 100 science and technology clusters globally by the end of last year, ranking first in the world for the first time.
Aleman said China also retains its top position in international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is one of the widely used metrics for measuring innovative activity.
Quarraisha Abdool Karim, president of the World Academy of Sciences, said ensuring a sustainable future through partnership and cooperation creates an opportunity for all participants to explore new pathways toward achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.
Highlighting that the development of new quality productive forces mainly relies on technological innovation, Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Chinese tech company Xiaomi Corp, said at the forum that the company will continue to step up investment in R&D and strive for breakthroughs in core technologies.
According to Lei, Xiaomi plans to invest more than 100 billion yuan in R&D over the next five years as part of its broader push to strengthen core competitiveness.
He said the company has invested heavily in intelligent manufacturing, with robotics and automated technologies applied to production lines, adding that Xiaomi aims to seize the opportunities in the smart electric vehicle sector through launching its first EV sedan.
Zhou Hongyi, founder of Chinese cybersecurity company 360 Security Group, said the artificial intelligence-powered large language model, which is regarded as a key part of new quality productive forces, will lead to a new round of industrial revolution.
Zhou said that large language models are expected to be used in a wider range of scenarios and fields this year to bolster industrial transformation and upgrading.
