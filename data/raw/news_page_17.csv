* China is on the cusp of an industrial revolution powered increasingly by basic research, where AI technology is rapidly emerging as a key catalyst for the advancement of frontier sciences.
* The Ministry of Science and Technology, together with the National Natural Science Foundation of China, launched a project to harness the power of AI in advancing frontier scientific research.
* ""AI4Science has enormous potential and will comprehensively transform the process from scientific research to industrial application,"" said E Weinan, a professor from Peking University.
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- At a state-of-the-art lab, a researcher scribbles a chemical formula on the smart glass surface.
Instantly, with a digital command, the robotic ""scientist"" empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) launches into executing a sequence of tasks including material retrieval, reagent addition, reaction initiation, monitoring and testing, all with the ease and precision of a culinary expert preparing a dish.
This vivid scenario unfolds within the cutting-edge automated laboratory at XtalPi's Shanghai headquarters. Here, AI is revolutionizing the field of new drug discovery, infusing the process with unprecedented efficiency and innovation.

China is on the cusp of an industrial revolution powered increasingly by basic research, where AI technology is rapidly emerging as a key catalyst for the advancement of frontier sciences.
In recent years, the prowess of machine learning and the emergence of generative AI technologies in tackling complex mathematical challenges have combined to usher in a transformative approach to scientific inquiry -- AI for Science (AI4Science).
This innovative paradigm is redefining the boundaries of research, enabling deeper exploration and discovery across various scientific disciplines.
Last year, the Ministry of Science and Technology, together with the National Natural Science Foundation of China, launched a project to harness the power of AI in advancing frontier scientific research.
The project is designed to deploy sophisticated AI models and algorithms to drive breakthroughs in genetic studies and stimulate significant progress in the field of biological breeding.
NEW MODELS
Earlier this month, OpenLAM, a Chinese open-sourced large language model (LLM), introduced a suite of seven innovative model solutions tailored to address complex challenges in areas such as alloy development, pharmaceutical small molecules, solid-state battery technology, semiconductors and high-temperature superconductivity.
AI technology has also made significant strides in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of weather forecasting, revolutionizing the way that people predict and prepare for meteorological events.
A Shanghai team has developed an AI weather forecast system named FengWu, based on multi-model and multi-task deep learning architecture, capable of generating high-precision global meteorological forecast results for the following 10 days in just 30 seconds.
Compared with traditional physical models, FengWu reduces the rate of error by 19.4 percent and extends the forecast range to 10.75 days based on reanalysis data, according to the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, one of its developers.
""The FengWu model exemplifies the transformative potential of AI within the realms of Earth sciences and beyond,"" said Ouyang Wanli, the lab's lead scientist.

Pangu Weather, another cutting-edge model developed by Huawei, is also making waves in the field of meteorology with its precise weather forecasts.
Its predictive accuracy, ranging from a period of one hour to seven days, has surpassed that of several meteorological centers in Europe and the United States for these same periods.
According to the Central Meteorological Observatory of China, the model showed impressive performance in the trajectory prediction of Typhoon Mawar in June 2023 and was successfully utilized in forecasting Typhoon Doksuri last year.
Moreover, in the vast expanses of the universe beyond our planet, AI is proving its capabilities, contributing to our understanding and exploration of the cosmos.
In a pioneering collaboration with the National Astronomical Observatories, Tencent, a Chinese tech giant, is spearheading a star exploration initiative that utilizes AI to boost the efficiency of pulsar searches conducted by China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST).
Remarkably, this AI-assisted approach can complete data processing work in three days that would otherwise have taken a year.
The initiative has already detected two fast radio bursts via the processing of celestial survey data, thereby contributing to studies that aim to deepen our understanding of the universe's origins.
NEW DISCOVERY
A research team in China's eastern coastal city of Yantai has successfully trained an artificial intelligence system for the purpose of catalyst screening. From an extensive pool of more than 14,000 potential candidates, they have pinpointed four molecular formulas, all of which have yielded highly satisfactory outcomes.
""Using conventional approaches, a seasoned analyst could perform approximately 20 experiments annually. To explore such a vast array of candidates, it would have required the efforts of 20 analysts over the span of 35 years,"" said Liao Zengtai, chairman of Wanhua Chemical.
""However, with the adoption of AI, this extensive endeavor was completed in a mere six months,"" Liao added.
The chemical supplier stands out as a pioneering enterprise that has mastered comprehensive manufacturing technology across the entire production chain of nylon 12, a polymer with excellent mechanical and corrosion-proof properties.

Another team from the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences has leveraged AI algorithms to design a de novo type of enzyme called cytochrome P450, which is known as a ""universal catalyst"" in the field of industrial biotechnology.
The catalytic capability of this enzyme has seen a 1.3- to 3.5-fold enhancement, according to the researchers.
AI technologies are instrumental in the intelligent optimization of chemical synthesis pathways, thus enabling the automation of lab procedures and expediting the discovery of new materials through sophisticated high-throughput screening, said Yang Jinlong, a professor from the University of Science and Technology of China.
Zhang Linfeng, the president of the AI for Science Institute in Beijing, cited an example of the enigmatic growth of lithium dendrites, which can render lithium batteries inoperative and remains an unsolved puzzle.
This is largely due to the limitations of conventional techniques in capturing the rapid, millisecond-scale transformations involving hundreds of thousands of atoms, according to Zhang.
Zhang's team and scientists from Peking University have worked with CATL, China's largest automotive lithium-ion battery maker, to develop new battery materials.
""The use of AI, particularly large language models, offers a promising avenue to achieve both precision and efficiency in this challenging domain,"" Zhang explained.
Zhang is also a founder of DP Technology, a Beijing-based startup that utilizes AI for molecular modeling to offer industrial design across a spectrum of industries, including bio-pharmaceuticals, renewable energy and chemical engineering.
DP Technology has been listed in CB Insight's AI 100 ranking in 2024. This exemplifies the significant shift of China's AI4Science from the confines of research labs to the broader market arena, emerging as a highly sought-after investment opportunity.
MindRank, a Hangzhou-based biotech firm, utilized its own AI drug discovery to develop a small molecule medication. The AI tool assisted it to achieve an impressive feat which saw the research team identifying a preclinical candidate among nearly 100 molecules in just eight months.
The drug MDR-001 has now received clinical trial approvals in both China and the United States, targeting conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

AI4Science is set to exert a deep and lasting influence on the realm of basic sciences, with ripple effects extending to subsequent technological innovations and the field of smart manufacturing, according to a report by Crystal Stream Capital, a Beijing-based venture capital investor.
""AI4Science has enormous potential and will comprehensively transform the process from scientific research to industrial application,"" said E Weinan, a professor from Peking University.

Since July 20, a Chinese expedition team has been conducting research on the water resources and ecological environment in the headwater regions of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers.
The expedition, comprising around 20 members, carried out scientific investigations into river hydrology, water ecology, soil erosion, glaciers and permafrost in Qinghai Province.
Key research projects include estimating the carbon stock of wetlands, assessing the impacts of permafrost thawing on the plateau, and measuring the thickness of permafrost on glaciers.
Qinghai is home to the Sanjiangyuan area, which contains the headwaters of China's three major rivers: the Yangtze River, the longest in China; the Yellow River, the second-longest; and the Lancang River, which is known as the Mekong River after it flows out of China.
As important parts of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem, the headwater regions of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers play a crucial role in safeguarding water resources, protecting biodiversity and ensuring ecological stability.
Annual scientific expeditions to the source of the Yangtze River have been conducted since 2012.

China's breakthrough in treating hypertrophic heart disease garners global attention,2024-07-31,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0731/c90000-20200369.html,"Home>>
		
China's breakthrough in treating hypertrophic heart disease garners global attention
 (Xinhua) 09:22, July 31, 2024
WUHAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have pioneered a beating-heart myectomy system and developed a minimally invasive procedure to treat hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), attracting global attention.
The study was conducted by a research team led by Wei Xiang, a professor at the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, and was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
It is estimated that there are about 2 to 5 million patients with HOCM in China, and the global population of such patients stands at approximately 15 to 20 million, posing a serious threat to human health.
Currently, the conventional treatment for HOCM is through open-chest surgery to resect the hypertrophic myocardium. This surgical method is not only highly invasive but also technically challenging, with suboptimal outcomes and high mortality rates in hospitals with less experience.
The novel transapical beating-heart septal myectomy procedure has broken through the limitations of traditional open-chest procedures, allowing for the precise resection of hypertrophic myocardium without the need for chest opening, cessation of the heartbeat, or blood transfusion.
""In the field of HOCM surgery, we used to follow the world, but now we are keeping pace with it or even leading,"" Wei said.
Wei was recently invited to the Mayo Clinic, a world-renowned cardiovascular treatment center in the United States, to discuss this groundbreaking medical breakthrough. Cardiac surgeons from countries and regions such as the United States, Switzerland and Italy have also traveled to China to learn about the technology.

SANYA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- After several academic exchange trips to China, Thomas Gbokie, former deputy agriculture minister for regional development, research and extension at the Liberia Ministry of Agriculture, decided to continue his studies in China in 2018.
After completing his master's degree, which was jointly awarded by Nanjing Agricultural University and the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS) in Sanya, south China's Hainan Province, he jumped at the opportunity to study for a plant pathology PhD, specializing in disease control in coffee.
At Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City in Sanya, Gbokie walks quickly between test fields and a laboratory.
""The environment and the climatic conditions of Sanya and Liberia are almost the same, so I hope to put what I learned here into practice in my country,"" he said.
Agricultural cooperation between China and Africa has become increasingly close. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) has so far trained 276 students from African countries, and Nanjing Agricultural University has trained 345 senior agricultural technical and management personnel for African countries Since 2003.
Capacity building is key to achieving sustainable agricultural production in Africa, said Felix Dapare Dakora, former president of the African Academy of Sciences, adding that the Chinese government has given a lot of support to African countries in capacity building, and more and more Africans are coming to study in China.
In response to the urgent need of African countries for food production and agricultural development, China has shared knowledge and technologies.
In a field in Sangeng Village of Sanya's Yazhou District, Nigerian student Oluwole Gregory Ijiti followed his mentor Chen Qing to harvest new varieties of cassava under the scorching sun.
""This new variety can be eaten both fresh and processed, and has the characteristics of high yield, insect resistance and strong adaptability,"" Chen said.
Nigeria is the country with the largest harvested area for cassava, an important staple crop in the country. Chen, a researcher at CATAS, helped Ijiti find his research direction in consideration of the actual needs in cassava production in Nigeria and Ijiti's goal of improving capacity for technological innovation.
Tanzanian student Mkapa Dietram Samson came to Sanya with a clear goal -- to learn as much as he could about sisal. Tanzania is known for sisal production, but lack of advanced technology has seriously restricted the development of the industry in the country. Tanzania is looking to carry out cooperative research with China to improve the production level of its sisal industry.
""The mainstream sisal variety grown in China, the H11648, is from Tanzania. But it is amazing to find how fast technology has developed here,"" Samson said, adding that he hopes to learn and introduce China's sisal breeding technology and seedling tissue culture technology back home.
In order to expand the test area and speed up the research process, Samson's mentor Yi Kexian, with CATAS, planted many sisal plants in the open space around the laboratory. Yi often takes his African student around on an electric bike to check sisal growth and record data.
Many Chinese agricultural research institutions have extended invitations to African agricultural researchers to study in China and undertake joint research at the workshop on China-Africa Agricultural Science and Technology Cooperation under FAO South-South Triangular Cooperation Framework held in Sanya this year.
Sun Tan, vice president of CAAS, said that the academy would build an international education institute in Sanya, focusing on recruiting African students to carry out scientific and technological innovation in the seed industry, and the number of international students there will double within five years.
Meanwhile, 30 young African agricultural scientists will be provided with one-year training at the National Nanfan Research Institute (Sanya) under the CAAS, Sun said.

Chinese scientists reveal carbon sink on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau,2024-07-30,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0730/c90000-20200018.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists reveal carbon sink on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau
 (Xinhua) 14:50, July 30, 2024
LHASA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite the global warming and wetting climate, the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau plays an important role as a carbon sink, according to recent studies conducted by the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment (IMHE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The improvement of the carbon sink function of the terrestrial ecosystem in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region is an important manifestation of the effectiveness of the ecological security barrier construction and changing climate in the region, said Wei Da, a researcher with the IMHE.
Quantifying the dynamics of carbon sink under climate change and ecological restoration on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is one of the priority scientific concerns that urgently need to be addressed, scientists say.
The first demonstration base for carbon sink monitoring of artificial forests in Xizang was established in the city of Shannan this year.
The IMHE also led the construction of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau terrestrial ecosystem carbon flux observation network, which includes stations in Xainza, Shannan, Yadong, Hoh Xil, Gerze, Zhongba, Madoi, Shuanghu and Serling Co, covering typical alpine ecosystems such as forests, shrubs, meadows, grasslands, wetlands and lakes.
The network synchronously measures carbon flux, water and heat flux, photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity and precipitation.
Based on this monitoring network and cooperation with other research organizations, the research team from the IMHE has found that the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau remains an important carbon sink with potential in a warmer and wetter climate.
""We conducted continuous observation at 32 sites and identified the alpine ecosystem as an important carbon sink. Our new discovery shows that as the climate turns warmer and wetter, the alpine plants absorb carbon faster than permafrost releases carbon,"" said Wang Xiaodan, a researcher with the IMHE.
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is the world's largest high-altitude permafrost region, but climate warming may lead to the release of large amounts of permafrost carbon, thereby altering the regional carbon source and sink balance. Scientists have constructed a monitoring data base spanning the plateau and conducted systematic research on this issue.
""We found that 26 sites exhibit significant carbon sink status, with the volume of carbon sink much higher than previously expected. The strongest net carbon sink of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau occurs at an altitude of about 4,000 meters,"" said Wei.
""This study has preliminarily drawn a panoramic view of the carbon balance process on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. We found that the sustained warming and wetting climate on the plateau will be conducive to plant growth and further enhance the carbon sink,"" Wei said.
In another study, scientists focus on soil respiration, which is the primary carbon emission process in terrestrial ecosystems, accounting for 60 percent to 90 percent of the total ecosystem respiration and being a key factor in determining the size of the terrestrial carbon sink.
However, there is currently a lack of sufficient data support and scientific understanding regarding the impact of climate change and ecological engineering on deep soil carbon dynamics.
Researchers have established a comprehensive soil carbon process observation system to achieve long-term continuous acquisition of high-resolution data on soil carbon dioxide concentration, water content, temperature and salinity at various depths, which is a crucial approach to uncovering the underground carbon processes in ecosystems, according to Zhang Jianxin, a researcher with the IMHE.
The establishment of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau carbon flux monitoring network provides an observation and research platform for the plateau, serving as a long-term infrastructure for the dynamic assessment of carbon sink on the plateau, Wei said.
""We plan to increase the number of observation sites in unpopulated regions, eventually forming a comprehensive carbon flux observation network that covers major types of terrestrial ecosystems on the plateau,"" Wei added.

Chinese researchers identify mechanism behind obesity-inducing bacteria,2024-07-30,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0730/c90000-20199952.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers identify mechanism behind obesity-inducing bacteria
 (Xinhua) 13:52, July 30, 2024
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- In daily life, some people can eat voraciously and still appear slim, while others seem to gain weight with every bite and are naturally prone to obesity.
This observation is now backed by a recent finding from Chinese researchers, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, which suggests that the underlying cause might be Megamonas, a family of obesity-causing bacteria.
A team of researchers from Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, BGI Research, and the Institute of Intelligent Medical Research under BGI Genomics has identified the potential obesity-causing bacteria and revealed the underlying mechanisms in a large-scale cohort of obese individuals in China, the China Science and Technology Daily reported Monday.
IDENTIFYING BACTERIA
Numerous studies have highlighted the critical roles of gut probiotics in obesity. However, the specific microbes contributing to obesity and the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined.
The research team conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples from a cohort of 631 obese individuals and 374 normal-weight controls, identifying a Megamonas-dominated cluster of microbes enriched in the obese subjects.
The researchers identified three enterotype-like clusters among the 1,005 samples -- Bacteroides, Prevotella and Megamonas. Individuals enriched with Megamonas exhibited higher Body Mass Index (BMI) and a greater proportion of obesity compared to the other two types.
Further analysis revealed that three species of Megamonas are all positively correlated with body weight, waist circumference, and BMI. Therefore, the research team determined a significant association between Megamonas and obesity.
GENETIC RISK
Based on the findings about obesity-inducing Megamonas, the research team investigated the impact of Megamonas in populations with different genetic risks for obesity.
The study found that in the population with low genetic risk for obesity, the impact of Megamonas on BMI is significantly higher than in the population with high genetic risk.
Furthermore, the differences in gut microbiota between the obese group and the normal control group are more obvious in the population with a low genetic risk for obesity.
According to Wu Chao, the first author of the study and a researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, the findings indicate that for populations with a low genetic risk for obesity, the impact of gut microbiota on the occurrence of obesity is greater than for those with a high genetic risk.
UNDERLYING MECHANISM
To unveil the mechanism behind the obesity-causing bacteria, the research team conducted further experiments using various models such as specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice, germ-free (GF) mice, and small intestinal organoids, with M. rupellensis, a representative species of Megamonas, serving as the experimental feeding agent.
Animal experiments revealed that M. rupellensis had no significant effect on the body weight of SPF mice fed a normal diet, but it significantly promoted weight gain and fat accumulation in SPF mice on a high-fat diet.
In the GF mouse model on a high-fat diet, M. rupellensis also significantly increased body weight and could markedly promote intestinal fatty acid transport and lipid absorption.
The team of researchers has also verified the ability of M. rupellensis to degrade inositol both in vitro and in vivo. Inositol can inhibit the efficiency of fatty acid transport. This suggests that the obesity-inducing effect of M. rupellensis may be mediated through the degradation of inositol.
According to Yang Fangming, the co-first author of the article and a researcher at BGI, the study revealed a strong association between Megamonas and the occurrence of obesity and clarified the mechanism by which Megamonas induces obesity.
Yang said that the study is expected to provide a new target bacteria for the diagnosis and treatment of obesity in the future.

Chinese researchers identify mechanism behind obesity-inducing bacteria
 (Xinhua) 13:52, July 30, 2024
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- In daily life, some people can eat voraciously and still appear slim, while others seem to gain weight with every bite and are naturally prone to obesity.
This observation is now backed by a recent finding from Chinese researchers, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, which suggests that the underlying cause might be Megamonas, a family of obesity-causing bacteria.
A team of researchers from Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, BGI Research, and the Institute of Intelligent Medical Research under BGI Genomics has identified the potential obesity-causing bacteria and revealed the underlying mechanisms in a large-scale cohort of obese individuals in China, the China Science and Technology Daily reported Monday.
IDENTIFYING BACTERIA
Numerous studies have highlighted the critical roles of gut probiotics in obesity. However, the specific microbes contributing to obesity and the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined.
The research team conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples from a cohort of 631 obese individuals and 374 normal-weight controls, identifying a Megamonas-dominated cluster of microbes enriched in the obese subjects.
The researchers identified three enterotype-like clusters among the 1,005 samples -- Bacteroides, Prevotella and Megamonas. Individuals enriched with Megamonas exhibited higher Body Mass Index (BMI) and a greater proportion of obesity compared to the other two types.
Further analysis revealed that three species of Megamonas are all positively correlated with body weight, waist circumference, and BMI. Therefore, the research team determined a significant association between Megamonas and obesity.
GENETIC RISK
Based on the findings about obesity-inducing Megamonas, the research team investigated the impact of Megamonas in populations with different genetic risks for obesity.
The study found that in the population with low genetic risk for obesity, the impact of Megamonas on BMI is significantly higher than in the population with high genetic risk.
Furthermore, the differences in gut microbiota between the obese group and the normal control group are more obvious in the population with a low genetic risk for obesity.
According to Wu Chao, the first author of the study and a researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, the findings indicate that for populations with a low genetic risk for obesity, the impact of gut microbiota on the occurrence of obesity is greater than for those with a high genetic risk.

Drones and AI join China's battle against typhoons, floods
 (Xinhua) 10:05, July 30, 2024
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- In the ongoing flood season this summer, China is leveraging technologies from drones to AI models to improve the response to disasters including typhoons and flash floods.
Gaemi, the third typhoon of this year, made landfall last Thursday in coastal Fujian Province.
During the following days, about 312,700 people were evacuated to safety in a timely manner, with no casualties or major incidents reported in the province. Damaged power and telecom facilities were fixed quickly and resumed operation.
Fujian's effective response was also reflected in the early warning Flash SMS (Short Message Service) messages sent to local cadres before the typhoon arrived.
Nearly 350,000 people responsible for meteorological and geological disaster prevention and relief received the alert messages, which were displayed directly on their phone screens and did not disappear until they clicked to confirm receipt.
This is the first time the meteorological department has tried the mandatory reminder service, said Lin Weihua, a meteorological official of Fujian, noting that it helped improve the timeliness and accuracy of disaster warnings and gain the initiative for disaster relief.
While the Flash SMS helps people prepare when a typhoon approaches, drones flying into it enable forecasters to track it more closely and precisely calculate its intensity and influence.
China's meteorological authorities sent Haiyan-1, a large civil unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), into the interior of Typhoon Prapiroon, the fourth typhoon of the year, in the early morning of July 21, when the typhoon had just formed in the South China Sea.
Taking off from a meteorological base in south China's Hainan Province, Haiyan-1 released eight detectors to measure temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed and air pressure at various altitudes over a two-hour flight.
The more than 4,200 valid data items transmitted in real-time to the meteorological big-data cloud platform helped create a three-dimensional picture of the typhoon's structure.
Zhao Peitao, a researcher of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), said large UAVs carrying out observations of tropical depressions offer refined data support for the forecast of their development, paths, intensity and impact, thereby enhancing the forecast accuracy.
Apart from drones, more new technologies and innovations have been adopted across the country to help people handle the extreme weather and protect lives and properties.
In Guangchang County of east China's Jiangxi Province, a research team from East China University of Technology examined the health of dams using ground-penetrating radar and other equipment.
Previously, inspectors mainly relied on experience to judge whether the dam was stable. Wang Shuo, the team leader, said with this technology, inspectors can ""see through"" the dam structure and quickly determine whether there are hidden dangers such as holes, cracks, loose soil layers, piping and seepage.
In southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, officials of the Shapingba District have established the city's first digital flood response command system.
With access to real-time data from 14 reservoirs, 32 hydrological stations, and more than 2,800 automated rainfall stations across the Jialing River basin, the system enables comprehensive monitoring of rain and water conditions, building a ""digital dam,"" according to Ling Jian, deputy head of the district. It also uses three-dimensional modeling of buildings along the river to facilitate emergency response.
China is also exploring the booming AI technology in the battle against floods.
The CMA in June launched three AI-powered models to address difficulties in the short and medium-range weather forecast, the nowcast and the over-15-day forecast.
The meteorological department is strengthening the practical application of the three large models in the weather forecast during the current flood season, CMA official Liang Feng said.

The world's first large-scale seismic data processing model with 100 million parameters called ""DiTing"" has been officially released, a significant advancement for China in key technologies in seismology, according to the Chengdu science and technology bureau in Southwest China's Sichuan Province on Monday.
The model was developed by the National Supercomputing Center in Chengdu in cooperation with the Institute of Geophysics of the China Earthquake Administration and Tsinghua University, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
In September 2023, the National Supercomputing Center in Chengdu partnered with the Institute of Geophysics of the China Earthquake Administration to establish a joint laboratory for research into earthquake large-scale model innovation applications.
They launched the training of the ""DiTing"" model with researchers from Tsinghua University and the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, to advance artificial intelligence algorithms in seismology and research in earthquake monitoring and forecasting services, said Guo Li, chairman of Chengdu Supercomputing Center Operation Company, according to the supercomputing center on Monday.
The ""DiTing"" dataset is the first and one of the largest seismic AI training datasets for seismology with the most comprehensive sample types and labeling, said the center.
Researchers have developed a seismic wave model with 100 million parameters in the half-year study in the joint lab, which is now ready for use, and a version with 1 billion parameters is expected to be completed pre-training by August 2024, supporting earthquake prevention and disaster reduction efforts, according to the developers.
In the future, the model could be applied in fields such as mine seismic monitoring, shale gas exploitation, urban underground space structure detection, underwater earthquake monitoring, and others, according to the developers.

BANGKOK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A rare opportunity to see soil from the moon in person captivated crowds as the lunar sample from China's Chang'e-5 mission was under the spotlight in Bangkok.
Under collaboration between the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT) and the China National Space Administration (CNSA), the lunar sample was featured as one of highlights at Sci Power for Future Thailand Fair that concluded on Sunday.
Enclosed in a rotating crystal sphere, the 75-milligram sample named ""The Moon Shines Bright On Me"" invited visitors on a microscopic journey to the moon's surface and they marveled at the extraterrestrial material up close.
Experiencing the mysterious substance for the first time, elementary school student Tannya Neesanant was filled with excitement. ""The lunar sample's unusual color intrigued my curiosity, as it appeared to be sand rather than soil,"" the seven-year-old told Xinhua.
The exhibit is a portion of samples that Chang'e-5 lunar probe collected, one of the most complicated and challenging missions in China's aerospace history.
Being able to get ""closer than ever"" to the moon really inspired people from diverse backgrounds who visited the display, particularly children, to fuel their passion for learning and pursuing their goals, said Suppawat Zhou, a staff member at the exhibition.
""It was truly rewarding to see visually impaired and deaf students learning about the exhibits through the interpretation from their teachers, which sparked their keen interest in astronomy, space and technology,"" he added.
NARIT head Saran Poshyachinda said the exhibition also showcased advanced technologies Thailand has developed for astronomical research, such as an instrument designed to observe cosmic radiation and space weather from a lunar perspective, which will be aboard China's Chang'e-7 moon exploration mission.
In April, China and Thailand signed two memorandums of understanding to cooperate on exploration and peaceful use of outer space as well as on an international lunar research station.
""We are looking forward to receiving lunar samples from the CNSA for our laboratory test, so we can develop suitable instruments for future exploration on the moon's surface,"" Saran said in an interview with Xinhua.
""Collaboration with China is very crucial for developing our own capabilities and helping us to be in line with global leaders,"" he said.

 (Xinhua) 10:31, July 29, 2024
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a high-performance plastic-based thermoelectric material that holds great promise for applications in areas such as wearable electronics.
This innovative material, featuring lightness and softness, can employ temperature differences to generate electricity.
The study, conducted by a collaborative research team from the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS), Beihang University and other institutes, was recently published in the journal Nature.
""Many conductive polymers can serve as thermoelectric materials. When a temperature gradient is applied to these materials, an electromotive force is generated between the two ends of the material,"" said Di Chong'an, the study's corresponding author and a researcher at ICCAS.
He added that when an electrical circuit is established across these materials and voltage is applied, a temperature gradient is also generated between the two ends of the material.
""These phenomena open up the possibility of using lightweight and flexible plastics for thermoelectric power generation, paving the way for the development of adhesive and wearable electronics and temperature-regulating clothing,"" said Di.
In this study, the research team developed a thermoelectric material called polymeric multi-heterojunction (PMHJ), whose thermoelectric property surpasses the performance of commercially available materials in the same temperature range.
In addition, the team showed that the PMHJ structure is compatible with solution coating methods, meeting the need for large-area plastic thermoelectrics and enabling the development of affordable wearable thermoelectric technologies.

HEFEI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Surrounded by a huge reservoir and dense vegetation, an islet in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province, looks tranquil. Yet it is devoted to something very big, namely nuclear fusion research with the future of humanity in mind.
Science Island is an epitome of innovation and the opening up of China's science and technology in pursuit of future clean energy, as well as solutions to climate change and health problems, through global cooperation.
""One thing I really like here is, as you can see in the control room, the large number of young people that are involved in the project. This is exactly what fusion needs,"" said Richard Pitts, leader of the Experiments and Plasma Operation Section of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).
Being built in France by seven ITER members -- China, the European Union, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States, ITER will be the world's largest experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor. A tokamak is basically a magnetic cage designed to confine, shape and control the super-hot plasmas that make fusion reactions possible.
Pitts said that ITER should be seen as a foundational project to bring nations together, and China is a brilliant example of this.
China officially joined the ITER program in 2006. Nearly 10 percent of the procurement packages were undertaken by China. The Institute of Plasma Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP), located on the island, is the main unit of the Chinese mission.
""China is leading nuclear fusion. Our cooperation in basic research gave very good results in applied research,"" Grigory Trubnikov, director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said while visiting the island on July 1.
""We have a lot of plans together, and not only in basic research, but also in engineering, physics, novel energy, biomedicine and more to improve the quality of people's life,"" he noted.
Science Island is home to the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST), known as the ""Chinese artificial sun."" Its ultimate goal is to create nuclear fusion like the sun, using substances abundant in the sea to provide a steady stream of clean energy.
In 2023, a new construction and operation plan was developed for the ITER program, which requires experimentation to find and solve potential problems. With the same technology path and experimental conditions as ITER, EAST was chosen by the ITER organization as a partner in optimizing its new plans.
China has been sharing the achievements of EAST with the rest of the world.
In May 2023, the Chinese Academy of Sciences officially launched a pilot program on magnetic confinement fusion energy research for open innovation, aiming to build a globally competitive open innovation ecosystem.
With the support of major scientific facilities including EAST, ASIPP has actively facilitated the development of relevant disciplines and experimental devices in countries in Southeast Asia, West Asia, South America, and North Africa.
On July 25, 2023, Thailand's first experimental tokamak device was officially launched, the fruit of a joint collaboration between ASIPP and the Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology.
Aiming to enhance Thailand's capability in fusion research, the two sides had decided to join hands to build the first tokamak device in an ASEAN country, while also helping Thailand cultivate a team of young talents in fusion research.
""More than 100 people from our team travel to ITER headquarters almost every year to carry out joint research,"" said Gong Xianzu, head of division of EAST Physics and Experimental Operations.
Meanwhile, more than 500 foreign scholars visit Science Island every year for exchange and collaboration with their Chinese counterparts. The islet has introduced over 130 foreign professionals and established an innovation network covering more than 150 research institutions from about 70 countries and regions, according to the ASIPP.
About 16 km from Science Island lies the Origin Wukong, China's independently developed third-generation superconducting quantum computer.
Named after a mythical legend in China, the high-tech computer has demonstrated its powerful capabilities. Since starting operation on Jan. 6, it has completed about 250,000 quantum computing tasks for global users, and the number of instances of access to the computer for over 125 countries and regions has exceeded 12 million, according to local authorities.
China will enhance its capacity for opening up while expanding international cooperation, and capable private enterprises in leading national initiatives will be supported to make breakthroughs in major technologies, according to the resolution of CPC Central Committee on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization.
Computing power will be the foundation of the economy in the future, and quantum computing power is much stronger than that of a super computer and requires lower energy consumption, said Guo Guoping, chief scientist at Origin Quantum Computing Technology Co., Ltd.
""We can use quantum computing technology to achieve breakthroughs in various industries to improve productivity, create more value and help promote economic development,"" Guo added.

China establishes world's largest quake early warning network,2024-07-27,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0727/c90000-20198938.html,"Home>>
		
China establishes world's largest quake early warning network
 (Xinhua) 12:51, July 27, 2024
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully completed its National Earthquake Early Warning Project, unveiling the world's largest earthquake early warning network, the China Earthquake Administration (CEA) said on Friday.
The project, through the deployment of 15,899 monitoring stations across the country, will provide the public with earthquake early warning service and rapid earthquake intensity reporting service, Yin Chaomin, vice head of the administration, said at a press conference.
Earlier warnings issued by the project can reach the public through TV, IPTV, mobile APPs such as WeChat and Alipay, as well as loudspeakers in villages, according to Yin.
Earthquake early warning relies on a dense network of seismic monitoring stations to issue alerts before destructive seismic waves arrive. It takes advantage of the fact that seismic waves travel significantly slower than electromagnetic waves.
The public can take precautionary measures to reduce casualties, after receiving warnings a few seconds to tens of seconds before the arrival of the seismic waves.
According to Yin, through the project, China made significant breakthroughs in the core technologies of earthquake early warning and rapid intensity reporting, and the overall performance of the system is comparable to international advanced standard.
For the five critical zones including north China and coast areas of southeast China, the project can issue early warning signals within seconds of an earthquake. It can also report the intensity of any earthquake that occurred in any part of China within minutes.
The project can detect an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.5 or above for most parts of the country. In the eastern regions, it can detect any earthquake with a magnitude of 2.0 or above. In densely populated areas like the capital circle and the Yangtze River Delta, any earthquake with a magnitude of 1.0 or above will be detected by the project.
The project has been integrated with industries such as railways, pipelines, power grids, nuclear power, and natural gas, Yin said.
China is a country of many earthquakes. In 2023, the country reported 18 earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 or above. Of these, 11 occurred on the Chinese mainland, including 2 with a magnitude greater than 6.

Chinese people embrace science craze during summer vacations
By Yuan Quan (Xinhua) 11:55, July 27, 2024
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Many travelers in China this summer are seeking to shake things up a bit, exploring vacation options in the world of science and technology. This reflects a growing fascination with all things scientific in the country.
In Beijing, holiday-makers have been enjoying a ""cooling"" break from the scorching heat thanks to science exhibits with a polar twist. Visitors at the National Museum of China have been exploring an exhibition on the country's polar expeditions, pausing to marvel at a display of ice cores and meteorites from the Antarctic.
At the other end of the scale, some people are heading to the beach not to cool off, but to witness the fiery spectacle of space travel. Travel agencies are receiving numerous bookings for Haiyang, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Province, where an offshore rocket launch is scheduled to take place in August.
The north-western provinces, known for their cool summer climate, have witnessed a similar growing interest in space science. While grasslands, grottoes, and the Great Wall have long been popular tourist attractions here, tens of thousands of people now flock to the area for a unique experience -- a simulated Martian habitat on the edge of the Gobi Desert that offers visitors a taste of life on the red planet.
SCI-TECH BUSINESS
Meanwhile, sci-tech enterprises across China are increasingly seeing the money-making possibilities in the country's travel boom.
In Hefei, capital city of Anhui Province, leading artificial intelligence company Iflytek has launched study tour programs aimed at showcasing its voice-recognition tools and robots to teenagers. And the Hangzhou-based electric vehicle manufacturer Geely has partnered with travel agencies to open its workshops to visitors nationwide, showcasing the manufacturing process of its new energy cars.
Big high-tech industrial projects have also drawn their share of visitors. In Dunhuang, Gansu Province, a molten-salt solar thermal power station dubbed the ""super powerplant in the desert,"" has become a popular tourist destination, offering a stark contrast to the city's millennium-old cultural relics. Social media platforms have been flooded with breathtaking drone photos of this impressive structure, which consists of 12,000 mirrors and covers an area equivalent to 780 football fields.
Local officials are optimistic that the thriving science-themed tourism industry will drive economic growth. For instance, in northwest China's Jinta County, near the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, the local government has recently unveiled a comprehensive plan to construct a space tourism complex that offers space exhibitions, science education, science fiction entertainment and sightseeing services. Facilities such as hotels and restaurants are also being expanded to support the construction of a ""space town.""
THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE
Many universities and research institutes have also been embracing the trend of science-themed tourism.
Beihang University is among them, attracting visitors by displaying its latest sci-tech achievements. The university's museum, known as the Beijing Air and Space Museum, will soon exhibit a range of space-related artifacts, including taikonaut Gui Haichao's space suit, as well as the return capsule and parachute used during his space journey. Gui is a professor at Beihang, and in 2023, he became China's first payload specialist to fly to the country's space station.
As the school summer vacations get underway, universities in Hubei Province and institutions under the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Jilin Province, which were originally supposed to close their campuses, have now opened their facilities and key labs for students and parents who are eager to enrich their science education.
There are some good options also for moviegoers, with cinemas showing two Chinese films about Earth science this summer. Although they have less showtime than cartoons and comedies, they still represent a significant milestone, marking the first release of domestic science films since 2000.
Despite her tight travel schedule, Xiao Heng from Changsha, Hunan Province, has brought her 8-year-old son to watch the film on their trip to Beijing. She said watching such a science film was as educational as taking a class to acquire knowledge.
Ancient Chinese considered traveling as important as reading for acquiring knowledge. In the past, the preference was for cultural destinations that might enhance literary quality. These days, many people, especially parents like Xiao, see vacations as valuable opportunities to gain scientific knowledge.
CUTTING-EDGE ACHIEVEMENTS
The trend is partly due to China's rapid advancements in science and technology. Han Guojun, a leading expert at Beihang's museum, said that the number of visitors in 2023 exceeded that of the pre-COVID year of 2019 by 30,000, and the surge coincided with the country's remarkable progress in space exploration, from extensive rocket launches to the construction of the Tiangong space station.
""The public needs a better understanding of our country's cutting-edge achievements in aerospace,"" Han said, adding that visiting a space-themed museum filled with numerous spacecraft models and collections is an excellent choice.
On Tuesday, he guided a group of 160 teenagers from Hong Kong, who were on a space-themed trip across the country. Organizers said that the purpose was to provide Hong Kong youth with a deeper understanding of the advancements in space exploration made by the motherland.
STUDY TOURS
Feng Ying leads a travel agency in Liaoning Province that organizes study tours nationwide. She said that more parents are now willing to enroll their children in tour programs offered by tech companies. Despite the high costs of these study tours, which can be priced at hundreds of yuan for just half a day, most parents do not hesitate to invest in them.
The participation of sci-tech enterprises and institutions in this new travel trend brings two-way benefits. Iflytek told Xinhua that its involvement in study tours is not driven by profits, but is linked with a desire to promote new products and engage with customers.
Tours provide teenagers with a practical understanding of how the technical terms they often hear in daily news -- like AI models and voice recognition -- are applied in real-life situations, according to Iflytek.
STRATEGIC CHOICE
China regards education, science and technology, and talent function as basic and strategic pillars for its modernization. A resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization, which was adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held last week, highlights the crucial role of universities, research institutions, high-tech enterprises and national laboratories in strengthening the country's strategic science and technology capabilities.
""With a focus on advancing the frontiers of global science and technology, and the government's commitment to promoting China's development through science and education, there has been a surge in the demand for scientific knowledge,"" said Wei Xiang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
He said he believes that the combination of learning and travel can effectively cater to the public's needs, and it is evident that science and technology are poised to become a future direction of the Chinese tourism market.

Chinese scientists discover highest-energy gamma-ray spectral line,2024-07-27,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0727/c90000-20198913.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists discover highest-energy gamma-ray spectral line
 (Xinhua) 11:47, July 27, 2024
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have identified a gamma-ray spectral line with energy levels peaking at 37 million electron volts, the highest-energy gamma-ray spectral line ever observed from cosmic celestial bodies. The discovery will significantly advance the understanding of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
The study, led by researchers from the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published as a cover story in the journal Science China Physics, Mechanics &Astronomy on Thursday.
GRBs, usually very short in duration, are the most violent explosive phenomena in the universe after the Big Bang, and they occur during the collapse of massive stars or the merging of binary compact stars, such as neutron stars and black holes.
The first GRB was discovered in 1967. In recent years, with the discovery of gravitational waves, GRBs have been under the spotlight in multi-wavelength and multi-messenger time-domain astronomy.
The brightest GRB ever, coded GRB 221009A, was observed worldwide on Oct. 9, 2022 and was found to result from the collapse of a massive star.
Chinese scientists detected the event through joint observations from the country's space-based as well as ground-based telescopes. These include China's first X-ray astronomy satellite, Insight-HXMT; the GECAM-C, an all-sky gamma-ray monitor dedicated to GRBs; and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, which works in the very high energy gamma-ray band. Together, they achieved an unprecedented measurement of the GRB.
During the study, the research team jointly employed data from the GECAM-C space telescope and the Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope to conduct a detailed spectral analysis and search for the spectral lines of GRB 221009A. They successfully extracted precise and reliable GRB spectra, after comprehensive and challenging analyses of the instrumental effects and background issues caused by the extreme brightness of this burst.
The research team discovered a spectral line in the energy spectrum of GRB 221009A featuring a power-law decay pattern for both the line energy and flux, and an almost constant and relatively narrow line width, as the burst goes on.
In particular, the researchers found that during the main burst phase of the GRB, the energy of this spectral line reached up to 37 million electron volts, setting a new record for the gamma-ray line observed in the universe.
Xiong Shaolin, the leader of the research team, who is also the principal investigator of GECAM series space telescopes at IHEP, noted that these findings hold great significance for studying the physics and mechanisms behind GRBs and relativistic jets launched by GRBs.
To unveil the mysteries of the extreme universe, China has launched a series of satellites for GRB observations, including Insight-HXMT, GECAM series, the Einstein Probe and the SVOM.

They successfully extracted precise and reliable GRB spectra, after comprehensive and challenging analyses of the instrumental effects and background issues caused by the extreme brightness of this burst.
The research team discovered a spectral line in the energy spectrum of GRB 221009A featuring a power-law decay pattern for both the line energy and flux, and an almost constant and relatively narrow line width, as the burst goes on.
In particular, the researchers found that during the main burst phase of the GRB, the energy of this spectral line reached up to 37 million electron volts, setting a new record for the gamma-ray line observed in the universe.
Xiong Shaolin, the leader of the research team, who is also the principal investigator of GECAM series space telescopes at IHEP, noted that these findings hold great significance for studying the physics and mechanisms behind GRBs and relativistic jets launched by GRBs.
To unveil the mysteries of the extreme universe, China has launched a series of satellites for GRB observations, including Insight-HXMT, GECAM series, the Einstein Probe and the SVOM.
