Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making waves in various industries, and the healthcare sector is no exception.
Stanford's AI town once went viral across the internet last year, with 25 intelligent agents living and socializing, resembling a real-life Westworld. And now, Chinese researchers have developed an AI hospital town!
In a recent interview with the Global Times, Chinese researchers shed light on the practical implications of this innovative approach to healthcare.
The concept of an AI hospital town, where virtual patients are treated by AI doctors, holds immense significance for both medical professionals and the general public. The AI hospital aims to train doctor agents through a simulated environment so that it can autonomously evolve and improve its ability to treat disease.
Recently, researchers from Tsinghua University have developed an AI hospital called ""Agent Hospital."" In this virtual world, all doctors, nurses and patients are driven by large language model (LLM)-powered intelligent agents, capable of autonomous interaction.
Remarkably, AI doctors can treat 10,000 patients in just a few days. It would take human doctors at least two years to treat that many patients. Furthermore, evolved doctor agents achieved an impressive 93.06 percent accuracy rate on the MedQA dataset (US Medical Licensing Exam questions) covering major respiratory diseases. They simulate the entire process of diagnosing and treating patients, including consultation, examination, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.
Practical benefits expected 
The environment simulated in Agent Hospital consists of two main entities: patients and medical professionals. Their role information is generated by GPT-3.5 and can be infinitely expanded.
Agent Hospital includes various consultation rooms and examination rooms, requiring a series of medical professional intelligent agents to work. Therefore, researchers have designed a configuration of 14 doctors and four nurses - doctor agents are designed to diagnose diseases and formulate detailed treatment plans, while nursing agents focus on daily support.
Would the AI hospital town bring practical benefits to the real healthcare industry? The answer is yes.
Research team leader of the Agent Hospital Liu Yang, also executive dean of the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR) and associate dean of the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times that the AI hospital town is set to transform the way doctors diagnose and treat patients, bringing immense benefits to both medical professionals and the general public.
For example, this innovative concept allows for virtual patients to be treated by real doctors, providing medical students with enhanced training opportunities. By simulating a variety of AI patients, medical students can confidently propose treatment plans without the fear of causing harm to real patients due to decision-making errors, Liu said.
This simulation training enables medical students to practice diagnosis and treatment in a risk-free environment, ultimately leading to the cultivation of highly skilled doctors, according to Liu.
If the patients in the town are real and the doctors are virtual, online telemedicine services can be provided to patients. The AI hospital town utilizes a vast repository of authoritative medical knowledge, allowing AI doctors to handle thousands, even millions, of cases.
The potential for high-quality, affordable and convenient healthcare services for the public is on the horizon, as the diagnostic capabilities of AI doctors evolve from the virtual world to the real world, Liu stated.
Liu went on to say that the AI hospital town can simulate and predict various medical scenarios, such as the spread, development and control of infectious diseases in a region.
Future comes, with challenges and hopes
Some netizens have expressed that ""AI simulation will explore paths that humans fundamentally do not have the time or ability to explore.""
Imagine thousands of fully automated hospitals that will save millions of lives. This future is fast approaching.
Liu revealed that after approximately six months of research and development, the AI hospital town is nearing readiness for practical application. With plans to focus on a specific application direction, the town aims to be operational by the second half of 2024.
However, despite the promising prospects, the implementation and promotion of the Agent Hospital for AI diagnosis and treatment face significant challenges.
Liu stressed strict adherence to national medical regulations, thorough validation of technological maturity, and the exploration of mechanisms for AI-human collaboration are essential to ensure that artificial intelligence technology does not pose risks to public health.
AI can never replace humans
Looking ahead, the future of AI in the medical field appears bright, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology. We cannot deny that AI healthcare can surpass human physiological and intellectual limits in certain aspects, enhancing the precision and efficiency of healthcare services. However, one thing is certain - AI can never replace humans.
In medical practice, uncertainty is the norm, with each healthy individual and patient being unique. Even if they have the same disease, the course of the disease, as well as the psychological and sociological characteristics of the patient, varies significantly. These uncertain events ultimately need to be handled by humans, according to insiders.
Dr. Dong Jiahong, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and dean of the School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, was quoted by Hopes and Dreams - a Chinese platform focused on providing information in the field of AI - that medicine is a science of love and an art of warmth, while AI healthcare remains ""cold."" It cannot provide personalized care and compassion. Moreover, any legal responsibilities that may arise during the treatment process should be borne by real human doctors.

The application of rubber seal strips onto a car roof was accompanied by a captivating display of a huge robotic arm picking it up and rotating it mid-air. This interesting scene was unfolded at a 5G-Advanced (5G-A) flexible production line in a factory of China's carmaker Great Wall Motors (GWM) in Baoding, north China's Hebei province.
Thanks to the integration of 5G-A and artificial intelligence (AI), this efficient production line has slashed 60 hours of downtime per year, thus avoiding potential losses of over 800 million yuan ($110.36 million) that could have been incurred by delayed deliveries.
In recent years, China has made significant strides in AI development, marked by steady growth in industrial scale, robust infrastructure, and a rapid increase of innovative achievements.
""The vast application scenarios, huge market, and massive talent pool have laid a solid foundation for the vigorous development of China's AI industry,"" said Yu Youcheng, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI).
According to Yu, a large number of new breakthroughs, technologies and applications are rapidly emerging across different application scenarios in China.
Gradual improvement in infrastructure -- In 2023, the total size of China's data center racks reached 8.1 million and the scale of computing power reached 230 EFLOPS. In particular, the scale of intelligent computing power has reached 70 EFLOPS, an increase of over 70 percent.

Steady growth in industrial scale -- The total scale of China's core AI industry has exceeded 500 billion yuan, and the number of related enterprises has exceeded 4,500. According to a report released by CCID Consulting, a market research firm affiliated with China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID), the market scale of China's AI industry will reach 1.73 trillion yuan by 2035, accounting for 30.6 percent of the world's total.
Continuous expansion of integrated applications -- So far, large-scale AI models developed by China have shown tremendous potential in areas such as smart mining, drug research and development, meteorology, government services, finance, intelligent manufacturing, and railway management. The integrated application of the industrial internet in China has expanded to 49 major categories of the national economy, and generative AI has been widely applied in chatting robots, intelligent search, and text generation.
At the general cargo terminal of Rizhao Port in east China's Shandong province, a diverse array of general cargo items came together before making their way to different parts of the world, including steel plates made in Handan, north China's Hebei province, excavators from Zhuzhou, central China's Hunan province, and drainage pipes from Zhengzhou, the capital city of central China's Henan province.
In the past, the complex loading and unloading procedures for these items, which varied greatly in shape and size, resulted in low operational efficiency. Now, with an AI-enabled planning system, the port has boosted its overall operational efficiency by 10 percent and yard throughput by 20 percent.
Apart from assisting intelligent manufacturing, AI technology can also make typhoon forecasts, develop new drugs, identify faults, and formulate production plans. These remarkable breakthroughs are paving the way for an era of intelligence.
The application of AI technology in the transportation sector has enhanced operational efficiency and raised safety levels.

In Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province, buses have been connected to an intelligent traffic control system managed by the traffic police. When a bus approaches an intersection, the traffic signal will automatically switch to green, allowing the bus to have priority passage.
""Smart public transportation saves commuting time by 30.7 percent on average compared to regular transportation modes,"" said Liu Gao, a project leader of Hunan Xiangjiang Intelligent Science and Technology Innovation Center Co., Ltd. So far, 75 routes in downtown Changsha have gone through intelligent transformation, Liu added.
AI technology has also made scientific research more efficient. Chinese software company Kingsoft has unveiled a one-stop office productivity platform powered by AI, which can analyze data as well as read and recognize Chinese characters, serving as a ""well-rounded"" digital employee.
While applied in experiments, AI technologies can significantly save the time needed for scientific research. For instance, Baidu AI Cloud and Shanghai Jiao Tong University have jointly developed an open-source platform for scientific data, which can accelerate the entire chain of chemical synthesis, ranging from molecular design and reaction design to condition generation and reaction testing. This platform can reduce the time required for designing potential functional molecules, such as drug molecules and their synthesis plans, from several months to just dozens of minutes.
In the face of the booming development of the AI industry, many experts and business leaders have highlighted the importance of accelerating AI-related sci-tech innovation and promoting high-quality development and high-level application of AI in order to foster new growth drivers.
Moving forward, China will continue to enhance AI infrastructure, expand AI applications, and advance key and core AI technologies to bring its AI industry onto a higher level.

Compared to traditional plant breeding techniques, the biggest advantage of space breeding is that it can create germplasm resources with greater performances such as higher yield, shorter growth period, and better resistance to diseases in a relatively short period of time.
Cultivating a mature variety typically takes eight to 10 years. Throughout the lengthy breeding process, the seeds must undergo rigorous testing for yield, resistance, quality, and so on. The occurrence of a problem at any stage can potentially undo all previous efforts.
""A large number of strains are eliminated during tests, leaving only a very small proportion classified as space seeds, certified or acknowledged by professional institutions,"" Liu noted.
""From food crops and vegetables to fruits, flowers, and forage grasses, a whole batch of new varieties developed through space breeding has already entered the market and become part of our daily lives,"" Liu said.
By employing space breeding technology, China has managed to produce a variety of new strains in wheat, rice, corn, soybean, oilseed rape, peanut, cotton, tomato, pepper, cucumber, forage grasses, trees, and flowers, he added.
For instance, Luyuan 502 is a high-yielding and high-quality wheat variety jointly developed by the Institute of Crop Sciences under the CAAS and the Institute for Application of Atomic Energy under the Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences. It is the first and currently most widely grown space-bred crop variety in China.

""It solved the problem of lodging encountered during the cultivation of wheat varieties with heavy ears. It has been cultivated on 100 million mu (6.7 million hectares) of land,"" said Liu.
In 2021, Hangmai 802, a high-yielding and high-quality wheat variety, was certified in north China's Hebei Province. It features outstanding salt tolerance, strong resistance to various diseases, and adaptability to diverse conditions.
In 2013, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Fuyang City in east China's Anhui Province sent 100 grams of a self-developed wheat variety into space. After several rounds of field screening, the academy finally identified an excellent strain three years later, which won the province's approval for mass planting in 2021.
The planting area of the new wheat variety totaled 400,000 mu in the autumn of 2023, covering the provinces of Anhui, Henan, and Jiangsu, said Feng Jiachun, director of the wheat research and development center of the academy.
In 1987, China's ninth recoverable satellite sent crop seeds into space, marking the start of the country's space breeding journey.

File photo taken in 2023 shows Liu Luxiang, chief scientist of China's space breeding program, checking on the growth of Hangmai 802, a high-yielding and high-quality wheat variety, at an experimental base in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province.
In 2006, China launched the Shijian-8 satellite, the world's first dedicated specifically to seeds, carrying over 200 kilograms of seeds of grain, cotton, oil crops, vegetables, fruits, microorganism, and coarse cereals.
In recent years, China has made significant strides in research on space mutagenesis mechanisms, seeing outstanding achievements in developing new germplasm resources, the number of new space-bred varieties, and the cultivation area of these varieties.
By developing extravehicular equipment and technology for space radiation biology, breeding experts can engage in space-induced mutation breeding and thereby establish a new space breeding system based on China's space station, Liu said.
He also suggested developing a diverse range of new varieties, taking the lead in innovation in the seed industry, and integrating space breeding with new business models to facilitate the development of the space economy.

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhou-18 crew members on board China's orbiting space station completed the first spacewalk of their mission at 6:58 p.m. (Beijing Time) on Tuesday, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu worked for about eight-and-a-half hours in completing multiple tasks, including the installation of space debris protection devices, and were assisted by the space station's robotic arm and a team on Earth.
The task has set a new record for the longest single spacewalk by Chinese astronauts.
Ye and Li Guangsu, the two crew members assigned the spacewalk duty, have since returned safely to the Wentian lab module.
This marked Ye's second extravehicular activity (EVA), following his initial spacewalk during the Shenzhou-13 mission, while Li Guangsu embarked on a spacewalk for the first time.
The mission will involve numerous other tasks, with the Shenzhou-18 crew set to engage in a slew of scheduled space science experiments and technical tests, while they will also undertake additional extravehicular activities and install payloads outside the space station, according to the CMSA.
So far, Chinese astronauts have successfully carried out a total of 16 EVAs. On Sept. 27, 2008, astronaut Zhai Zhigang in Shenzhou-7 mission made history as China's first person to conduct a spacewalk, which lasted approximately 19 minutes.
The Shenzhou-15 crew has achieved a milestone by performing four spacewalks, marking the highest number of EVAs by a single Chinese astronaut crew.
The Shenzhou-17 crew completed, for the first time, the in-orbit maintenance of extravehicular facilities during their second spacewalk, which lasted approximately eight hours.

Industries powered by AI have experienced an increase in total factor productivity, an indicator widely recognized as a defining characteristic of new quality productive forces.
Song Tao, the general manager of Lenovo Group's Manufacturing Sector for Government and Enterprise Businesses, envisioned a future where AI technology drives and fosters a slew of emerging industries and innovative frontiers.
BETTER QUALITY
At a data center in Shanghai's North Bund, expansive screens pulse with live operational data from a staggering 700,000 textile machinery units nationwide in over 9,000 textile enterprises.
Bolstered by AI's prowess, small and medium-sized textile firms have now hopped aboard the fast-moving train of intelligent manufacturing.
The ""miniature robots"" integrated into weaving machines, which are developed by the startup Zhijing Technology, have made simultaneous weaving and quality inspection possible.
Equipped with AI-empowered visual recognition, those machines can identify flaws on-the-fly during the weaving process and instantly trigger alarms, an innovative approach that ensures a ""non-stop"" inspection, significantly enhancing efficiency and quality control.
""Now, with just a few taps on my phone, I can check the production data of each machine and remotely understand the factory's production status,"" said Gu Chang, owner of a medium-sized textile factory in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
""Thanks to the deployment of those robots, our two workshops are now churning out an impressive 250,000 meters of fabric daily, with machine efficiency nearing 95 percent, a benchmark that is considered exceptionally high within our industry,"" said Gu.
""In the past, weaving was heavily dependent on individual expertise, a process susceptible to mistakes,"" said Guan Ruifeng, vice president of Zhijing Technology.
""The AI system has significantly streamlined operations and enhanced product consistency, cutting down the sampling time from the previous three to five days to 24 hours at the shortest,"" said Guan.
""By concentrating on the digital transformation requirements of local traditional sectors and fostering the synergy between general artificial intelligence and emerging industries as well as the real economy, we can develop an array of holistic, diverse, and frequently utilized application solutions,"" said Zhao Chunjiang, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
EMERGING INDUSTRY
Micro-Intelligence is a ""unicorn"" enterprise based in Changzhou, a city that has risen to prominence as the nation's hub for the manufacturing of power batteries.

The answer could be found at the Youyi Port in Pingxiang, south China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, where trucks fully loaded with imported fruits are always seen lining up for customs clearance.
""The hotter it gets, the less time the fruits can wait,"" said Cai Zhenyu, general manager of an international logistics company based in Guangxi, who has been engaged in the food import business for over 10 years.
""A delay means a drop in fruits' price, and if the delay is too long, the entire truckload becomes worthless,"" Cai explained.
According to him, the import process involved inspections, customs declarations, weighing, and vehicle transfers, which took five to six hours at best, or even two to three days sometimes, leaving the cargo owners anxious.

Thanks to the development of the Digital Silk Road and the continuously optimized intelligent customs clearance system, importers don't have to wait for their bills of entry to be stamped today, as truck drivers can pass through checkpoints with just a face scan or fingerprint verification.
""In cases where no inspection is required, it takes only about 10 minutes for truck drivers to leave the customs supervision area from entry,"" Cai noted, adding that each step of the customs clearance process can be shown in real time on a mobile application.
Building the China-ASEAN Information Harbor is an important measure to promote Belt and Road cooperation and to strengthen connectivity between China and ASEAN countries. It aims to create an international communication passageway, a hub for big data resource application and services, a demonstration area for the application of new-generation information technology, a cluster for open cooperation in digital economy, and a center for cultural and people-to-people exchanges catered to ASEAN countries.
""We are striving to play a pivotal role in enhancing the development and application of information technologies and building the Digital Silk Road,"" said Wang Yongchao, director of the Department of Industry and Information Technology of Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.

Currently, China and Vietnam are collaborating on the expansion of the Youyi Port, with plans to introduce autonomous driving in the Chinese section of the cargo passage by the end of this year, thus providing contactless, unattended, and intelligent customs clearance services 24/7.
On the big screens in the exhibition hall on the first floor of the office building of China-ASEAN Information Harbor Co., Ltd. in Nanning, capital of Guangxi, there are various data and charts showcasing the achievements of information connectivity.
According to an executive of the company, in recent years, the company has built multiple digital platforms and even replicated China's successful shared electric bike business in overseas trials.
The China-ASEAN Information Harbor has set up a multi-path system centered around Nanning, while Guangxi is accelerating the construction of an administration of international communication accesses. Over the past five years, Guangxi's total foreign trade with ASEAN has grown at an average annual rate of 10.5 percent. In the first quarter of this year, the autonomous region's imports and exports with ASEAN hit 90.12 billion yuan ($12.68 billion), an increase of 33.3 percent year-on-year.
""China and ASEAN have been each other's largest trading partners for four consecutive years. Digital connectivity not only facilitates trade but also further enhances mutual understanding between peoples,"" said an official with the Big Data Development Bureau of Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.

Over 400 Cretaceous dinosaur footprint fossils discovered in SW China,2024-05-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0528/c90000-20175033.html,"Home>>
		
Over 400 Cretaceous dinosaur footprint fossils discovered in SW China
 (Xinhua) 10:50, May 28, 2024
KUNMING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 dinosaur footprint fossils from the early Cretaceous period have been discovered in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Yunnan Province, according to researchers.
The fossils were found in the mountains in Konglongshan Town, Lufeng City. On-site determination has indicated that the rock strata containing the dinosaur footprints date back approximately 120 million years, said Wang Tao, head of the dinosaur fossil protection and research center of Lufeng.
Wang said the fossils can be classified into three types: large-sized footprints resembling those of sauropods, such as diplodocuses; footprints resembling those of theropods, such as tyrannosaurs; and footprints with noticeable depressions at the front end, indicating that the dinosaurs walked with their toes touching the ground and possibly belonging to stegosaurs or ankylosaurs.
""Based on on-site observations, it is speculated that this area may have been located on the edge of a lake, surrounded by abundant vegetation. After various types of dinosaurs finished feeding, they may have come to the lake to drink water and stepped into the mud and sand at the water's edge,"" Wang said.
Konglongshan Town, whose name translates to ""dinosaur mountain,"" is a concentrated discovery area for fossilized dinosaur footprints. However, a discovery of such scale and variety is unprecedented, indicating the extensive presence of a diverse dinosaur population in the Lufeng area during the early Cretaceous period, according to the researcher.
Since 1938, over 120 dinosaur fossils have been excavated in Lufeng, yet none from the Cretaceous period had been discovered before now. Wang said that the newly discovered dinosaur footprints are of significant importance to future efforts to locate dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous period in the area.

Brain-computer interface ushers in mind-control era
 (Xinhua) 16:46, May 27, 2024
TIANJIN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A stroke patient who donned a brain electrode cap was attempting to lift a bottle from the table using her fingers and an additional ""sixth finger"" device mounted on the wrist.
""Try again, focus your attention, and see if you can lift the bottle,"" said a neurological physician encouragingly.
With each attempt -- once, twice, thrice, -- the patient who had been unable to grip a pen witnessed the bottle slowly detach from the tabletop. The expression transformed from initial despair to incredulous astonishment, culminating in a moment as tears brimmed in her eyes.
Wang Zhuang, a third-year doctoral student and a member of the neural engineering team at Tianjin University, intently watched the patient and the ""sixth finger"" device on her hand, while meticulously recording every fluctuation in the data.
The team has crafted an innovative finger-worn device, leveraging non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to harness the patient's brainwaves, enabling stroke patients to mentally ""command"" an extra digit.
Also, the device serves to revitalize the patients' compromised central and peripheral nervous systems, thereby facilitating the rehabilitation of hand motor functions.
The BCI, a technology heralding the future, is swiftly emerging as a focal point for global investment. Scientists and engineers are eager to integrate this pioneering tech into the realm of medical practice, embracing a new era of therapeutic possibilities.
""Stroke stands as a significant threat to the health of our nation's populace, often leaving patients with varying levels of physical impairment,"" said Wang.
""Our aspiration is to harness the power of technology to offer them enhanced opportunities for a life of completeness and fulfillment,"" he added.
In January, a Chinese clinical team from Xuanwu Hospital had implanted a wireless processor into the skull of a paralyzed man, and this significantly assisted him to recover his motor skills, including drinking a bottle of water on his own.
China has unveiled guidelines to support the technological innovation, industrial cultivation and safety governance of future industries, including the BCI industry.
According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology's report on the development and application of BCI (2023), medical treatment stands as the predominant application domain for BCI technology in China.
Approximately 200 medical BCI enterprises operate in China, with a quarter of them pioneering in the field of implantable technology, while the remaining are dedicated to the development of non-implantable technologies, according to the report.
Mei Jie, a colleague of Wang, has uncovered additional potential within the BCI system. After six months of dedicated effort, he has successfully engineered a drone that can be controlled by brain signals.
""We have achieved for the first time the continuous brain control of a drone in four degrees of freedom,"" said Mei. ""This technology holds expansive potential for applications in various fields, including the identification of distant targets, thorough environmental surveillance, and the monitoring of anomalies.""
In pursuit of evaluating and fine-tuning the operational capabilities of the ""brain-controlled drone,"" Mei dedicated an entire three-month period to conducting experiments at the outdoor research facility.
""Scientific research mirrors the process of cultivating crops that demands patience and persistence as the fruits of one's labor are not instantly harvested, but rather mature over an extended period of growth and fruition,"" said Mei.

Chinese researchers discover mechanism to trigger plant regeneration
 (Xinhua) 16:35, May 27, 2024
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers recently discovered the primary wound signal that initiates plant regenerative responses, providing a convenient method for improving the crops' genetic transformation efficiency.
Plants are more prone to injuries than animals, and they have evolved an extraordinary ability to cope with them. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive wound-induced regenerative responses have long been unknown.
Therefore, the journal Science selected ""What controls organ regeneration?"" as one of the top 25 questions among 125 major questions for humankind to answer.
A team of researchers led by Li Chuanyou from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported that their discovery the REGENERATION FACTOR1 (REF1) is the primary wound signal that initiates plant regenerative responses.
The study showed that when plant cells are injured, REF1 binds its receptor PORK1 to activate SlWIND1, a master regulator of wound-induced cellular reprogramming, thereby initiating regenerative responses.
Meanwhile, an activated SlWIND1 binds the promoter of the REF1 precursor gene to activate its expression, thereby amplifying REF1 signaling for tissue repair and organ regeneration.
The study also found that the application of REF1 has dramatically improved regeneration ability and transformation efficiency in several crops which are difficult to transform, including soybean, wheat, and maize.
The discovery provides a convenient and universal solution to address bottleneck issues such as low genetic transformation efficiency and dependence on species and genotypes in breeding practice, according to the study published in the journal Cell.
