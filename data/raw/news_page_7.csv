GUIYANG, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from China, France, Portugal, Belgium and other countries gathered on Friday at the Shuanghe Cave, Asia's longest known cave, in southwest China's Guizhou Province for a launch ceremony of the 23rd joint international scientific expedition into the cave.
The expedition is scheduled for Oct. 7 to 24, and the results of their findings will be made available on Oct. 24.
Previous scientific expeditions found 44 individual giant panda fossils, with the oldest specimen dating back 100,000 years and the most recent dating back a few hundred years.
The fossils prove that Guizhou was once a habitat for giant pandas, which are today known to survive in the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu.
Zhou Wenlong, deputy secretary general of the Guizhou Cave Association, said the upcoming cave expedition will further study the cave's resources, formation and evolution.
According to the results of the 2023 joint expedition, the cave network has 107 connected openings and boasts a length of 409.9 kilometers, making it the longest known cave in Asia and the third-longest in the world. It is also the world's longest dolomite cave.
French caver Jean Bottazzi, who has more than three decades of cave exploration experience in China, is acting as chief of the upcoming cave research. He calls Shuanghe Cave his second home.
He said that since the late 1980s, the discoveries of Chinese and foreign experts in the cave have led to repeated updates of the cave's length, and many cave fossils and living organisms have been unearthed, providing rich, valuable scientific research materials.
During this year's scientific expedition, Suiyang County, which administers the cave area, will hold activities such as a geological science photography contest and a short video contest to promote the cave geopark.

HEFEI, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists used an independently developed resistive magnet on Sunday to produce a steady magnetic field of 42.02 tesla, equivalent to over 800,000 times the Earth's magnetic field, breaking a world record set by the United States in this field in 2017.
The milestone achievement made by the High Magnetic Field Laboratory of the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CHMFL) is expected to drive scientific discoveries and applications in a wide range of technological fields.
The steady high magnetic field is an extreme experimental condition, serving as a powerful tool for scientific research. In the experimental environment of a high magnetic field, the properties of matter can be manipulated, which is conducive to scientists discovering new phenomena and exploring new laws of matter, experts explained.
High magnetic fields can also give rise to new application technologies, such as electromagnetic metallurgy and chemical reaction synthesis, and especially the widespread utilization of nuclear magnetic resonance technology in medical science.
Due to its significant value in various fields such as physics, chemistry, material science and life science, the steady high magnetic field is referred to as the ""cradle"" of the Nobel Prizes.
The new achievement results from nearly four years of efforts by the research team, which involved innovating magnetic structures and optimizing manufacturing processes, said Kuang Guangli, academic director of CHMFL.
Kuang said this breakthrough could meet users' needs for a fast, regulated and stable high magnetic field, provide scientists with powerful experimental conditions, and lay a key technological foundation for China's construction of higher-field steady magnets.
Five major steady high magnetic field laboratories are located in the United States, France, the Netherlands, Japan and China.
As one of China's major items of scientific and technological infrastructure, the steady high magnetic field facility in Hefei, east China's Anhui Province, went into operation in 2017. Chinese scientists produced the world's highest steady magnetic field of 45.22 tesla by using a hybrid magnet at the facility in 2022.
Steady high magnetic field magnets include resistive magnets, superconducting magnets and hybrid magnets. According to experts, resistive magnets have the advantage of flexible and quick control, providing reliable and efficient experimental conditions for scientific research.
Kuang likened resistive magnets and superconducting magnets to singles players in table tennis and hybrid magnets to mixed doubles players. ""After winning the mixed doubles championship in 2022, our team has now also claimed a singles championship,"" said Kuang.
China's steady high magnetic field facility has provided experimental conditions for more than 197 domestic and international institutions, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, the University of Science and Technology of China, and Harvard University. These users have carried out cutting-edge research in the fields of physics, chemistry, materials, engineering, life and health.
With the help of the facility, scientists have uncovered the molecular and neural mechanisms of enhancing learning and memory by exposure to sunlight, as well as developing drug candidates for targeted cancer therapy, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes.
Kuang said that the team plans to develop new steady magnets to support the development of new electronic materials, explore the mechanisms and applications of high-temperature superconductivity, study the pathology of major diseases and related drugs, and produce high-performance semiconductor materials.

Sigma Geography was jointly developed by the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, and the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
 
The research team established a comprehensive geographic corpus covering four major categories and sixteen subcategories, providing 32.3 billion geographic tokens for the large model's self-supervised learning. They also crafted over 40,000 high-quality geographic instructions for model fine-tuning.
""Compared to general-purpose large language models, Sigma Geography is more familiar with the language patterns, professional terminology, and domain knowledge of geography, leading to an accuracy improvement of around 31 percent on the geographic benchmark test set,"" said Su Fenzhen, deputy director of the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research.
Su compared Sigma Geography with Chat-GPT in answering geographic professional queries and found that Sigma Geography provided more accurate and comprehensive responses, tailoring answers to the roles of different questioners.
The research team explained that this was achieved through their innovative user profile, precise discrimination, and response technology. Consequently, Sigma Geography can fully consider the cognitive and expressive differences in geographic scientific knowledge systems among geography enthusiasts, geography students, and researchers, providing tailored solutions to geographic professional questions that align with users' knowledge structures through a combination of text and images.
 
In addition, Sigma Geography can retrieve different geographic elements based on generated text answers, match them with geographic landscape photos, thematic maps, or schematic diagrams for presentation to questioners, and follow user instructions to complete processes such as data acquisition, information analysis, and map production, ultimately generating the specialized geographic charts users need.
Sigma Geography has supported the publication of over ten high-level academic papers in journals such as Nature sub-journals, The Innovation, and Earth's Future, according to the research team.
In the future, the research team plans to advance the development of large-scale map models and geographic reasoning engines, aiming to enable geographic science large models to act as geointelligent scientists, Su said.
They also intend to build a collaborative platform for geographic research, allowing every scientist and research team to possess their exclusive geographic models for collaborative work with millions of scientists through shared data, models, research ideas, and more.

"Cooperation in AI has potential for China, other developing economies",2024-09-19,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0919/c90000-20220647.html,"Home>>
		
Cooperation in AI has potential for China, other developing economies

Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to deliver significant and ongoing opportunities for the world's economy. This brings a new chance for mutually beneficial cooperation among emerging economies.
India is a typical example. Some of the new careers emerging in the country, such as data labeling - identifying raw data including images, and adding one or more meaningful and informative labels to provide context so that a machine learning model can learn from this information - have attracted the attention of some start-ups from developing countries.
India's electronics industry is another beneficiary. For instance, Reuters reported on Tuesday that China's Lenovo Group will start making AI servers at its plant in southern India, and that it has opened an AI lab to do research and development work specializing in servers in the tech hub of Bengaluru.
As AI continues to advance, its potential to affect the economy grows exponentially. Not only are there more types of jobs as a result of the generative AI boom, but companies are investing more in AI-related supply chains.
The global AI market was estimated at $196.63 billion in 2023 and is projected to show a compound annual growth rate of 36.6 percent from 2024 to 2030, according to a report by Grand View Research. The continuous innovation by tech giants is driving the adoption of advanced technologies in various industries, such as vehicles, healthcare, and manufacturing.
Many developing countries are looking to take a ride on the fast-growing AI engine to consolidate their growth momentum. Such efforts will increase economic growth, improve people's lives, and alleviate poverty.
India, for example, is attempting to jump-start AI development. The country in March approved a 103 billion rupee ($1.25 billion) investment in AI projects, including work to improve the computing infrastructure and develop large language models, Reuters reported.
India's AI market is projected to touch $17 billion by 2027, growing at an annualized rate of 25-35 percent between 2024 and 2027, the report said, citing IT industry body Nasscom.
Enormous potential remains to be tapped in the AI market in developing countries. As a result, cooperation in AI supply chains among multinational enterprises has received increasing attention. In this process, Chinese enterprises are increasingly venturing into the global arena, a reflection of the overall rapid development of China's AI industries.
The development of China's AI industry stems from demands for cost reduction, production automation, risk reduction, and an improvement in efficiency in many fields and scenarios such as offices, manufacturing, finance, and medical care. Innovation and development in related fields will jointly promote the vigorous development of China's AI industry.
Investment by Chinese companies is conducive to the development of AI in other developing countries. China and those countries enjoy strong complementarity in strengthening cooperation in AI supply chains. Lenovo's reported investment adds to evidence that China and India, two of the world's major emerging economies, have broad potential for economic and trade cooperation in the field of AI development.
Some challenges will remain, especially considering that India has tightened its scrutiny of investments from Chinese companies. However, if India wants to step up the revitalization of its domestic manufacturing industry and become a leading AI hub, it cannot rely solely on domestic companies. It should maintain and enhance its attractiveness to foreign investors, including those from China.
Economic complementarity between China and other developing countries will be further enhanced as Chinese enterprises step up outbound investment. If Chinese companies can help counterparts in other developing countries promote industrialization, then a win-win result can be achieved.

Yutu-2 becomes world’s longest-working lunar rover,2024-09-19,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0919/c90000-20220641.html,"Home>>
		
Yutu-2 becomes world’s longest-working lunar rover
 (Global Times) 08:39, September 19, 2024
As people across China and around the world celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival, traditionally marked by gazing at the full moon, China's Yutu-2 lunar rover has delivered a special surprise - fresh images from the moon's far side.
To date, Yutu-2 has traveled 1,613 meters on the lunar surface since its landing in January 2019, making it the longest-working lunar rover in the world.
The Yutu-2 rover, or Jade Rabbit-2, was launched into orbit in December 2018 as part of the Chang'e-4 lunar probe. It landed on the far side of the moon in January 2019. In Chinese folklore, Yutu is the mythical white rabbit that accompanies the moon goddess, Chang'e, from whom the lunar mission derives its name.
By far, the Yutu-2 has accumulated nearly 5 years and 9 months of operational time, far exceeding its designed lifespan of three months and having become the longest-working lunar rover. Recently, it completed its 71st lunar day of work and transmitted new images back to Earth, China Central Television reported on Tuesday.
During its stay on the moon, Yutu-2 has gathered valuable geological information, including data on the surface morphology, shallow structure, and material composition of the Chang'e-4 landing area. It has also contributed important scientific data regarding geological evolution and the early evolution of the moon's crust.
In addition to the Yutu-2, both the Chang'e-3 and Chang'e-4 landers are also active on the moon. China's relay satellites, Queqiao and Queqiao-2, are also still operational in the lunar orbit, according to Zuo Wei, deputy chief designer of the ground application system for the Chang'e-4 mission.
Queqiao has facilitated communication between the Chang'e-4 mission and Yutu-2, while Queqiao-2, after having completed the Chang'e-6 mission, is now conducting scientific exploration, awaiting the arrival of Chang'e-7.
Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration program, has previously revealed that the Chang'e-7 mission, planned for implementation around 2026, is progressing smoothly. The main task of this mission is to search for evidence of water ice at the lunar south pole.
If successful, the Chang'e-7 mission is expected to become the world's first to land on the lunar south pole, creating conditions for long-term human presence on the moon and paving the way for future human exploration of deep space, including Mars, Wu said.
