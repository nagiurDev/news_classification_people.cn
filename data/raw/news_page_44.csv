China has achieved the mass production of carbon-14 isotopes by using a commercial nuclear reactor, the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) told the Global Times on Sunday.
Experts noted that the domestic production will break an import dependency on carbon-14 isotopes, and has significance for agriculture, chemistry, medicine and biography in the country, sectors that widely use the element in detecting helicobacter pylori and pharmacokinetics research.
The carbon-14 isotope was produced by the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in East China's Zhejiang Province, which is operated by a CNNC subsidiary.
Fan Shen, a representative from the power plant, told the Global Times that China's annual demand for carbon-14 isotope used in helicobacter pylori detection is around 40 Curies, the total demand with scientific research is around 100 Curies.
""Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant's production capacity can fully meet the current domestic demand, and the final product of the carbon-14 isotope will be supplied to the market by the end of 2024,"" Fan said.
China's current carbon-14 isotope supply is heavily reliant on imports, which can be volatile and expensive, and has capped the development of downstream industries.
Chen Zhi, a professor from the School of Nuclear Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that carbon-14 isotopes are widely used in detecting helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer, but are difficult to mass produce.
""As the domestic mass production of carbon-14 isotopes has been realized, the cost of related medical tests and research of some new medicine will be largely reduced,"" said Cheng, who noted that it will help more people in China to screen gastric cancer and other diseases in advance with lower costs, and prevent the potential ""bottleneck"" issues.
China's eight top departments on June 2021 issued the mid- and long-term development plan for medical isotopes from 2021 to 2035, which stated to build an independent and stable medical isotope supply system.
In 2020, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant vowed to build China's largest isotope production base by carrying out the development of related industries, according to CNNC.
During the production of carbon-14, Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant also launched the mass production preparation for other isotopes including the lutecium-117 and yttrium-90, further upgrading China's supply capability of medical isotopes.

Chinese researchers develop new algorithm to recognize coronal mass ejections
 (Xinhua) 13:33, April 22, 2024
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a new algorithm to automatically derive kinematic parameters of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) based on machine learning, according to a recent research article published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, highlighting the great significance of this algorithm in predicting catastrophic space weather.
CMEs are large scale masses of plasma thrown from the sun into interplanetary space and are considered the largest form of energy release in the solar system. They constitute the major source of severe space weather events, with the potential to cause enormous damage to humans and spacecraft in space.
It is becoming increasingly important to detect and track CMEs, since there are now more space activities and facilities, the study noted.
The study of the revolution of CMEs in solar corona and interplanetary space is a major topic in the field of space weather, and so too the positional relations between CMEs and Earth's orbit, according to Shen Fang, a researcher with the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Their method consisted of three steps -- recognition, tracking, and determination of parameters.
First, the researchers trained a neural network to judge whether there were CMEs observed in images. Next, they acquired binary-labeled CME regions. Finally, they tracked a CME's motion in time-series images and determined the CME's kinematic parameters such as velocity, angular width, and central position angle.
The algorithm can identify relatively weak CME signals and generate accurate morphology information concerning CMEs, said Shen. It is expected to assist with real-time CME warnings and predictions.

Chinese scientists discover 46 subglacial lakes in Antarctica
 (Xinhua) 13:12, April 22, 2024
SHANGHAI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have newly discovered 46 subglacial lakes beneath the ice sheet in East Antarctica, using an innovative analysis method.
Antarctica is covered by a vast ice sheet with an average thickness of over 2,400 meters. Beneath this ice sheet, there exist numerous diverse subglacial lakes. They are formed when melting ice streams flow over depressions in the bedrock beneath the ice sheet, according to Tang Xueyuan, a research group leader from the Polar Research Institute of China (PRIC).
""The study of subglacial lakes in Antarctica is of significant importance for understanding ice sheet dynamics, sedimentary processes, subglacial geochemical cycles, as well as the evolution of life,"" said Tang.
Scientists have introduced a novel method utilizing Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to analyze the waveform features of ice bottom reflection shown in ice radar data. Employing this approach, the research team conducted a comprehensive scan of ice radar images in the AGAP-S region of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in East Antarctica. The results revealed the existence of 46 subglacial lakes characterized by geometric contours considerably smaller than those identified by conventional methods.
Scientists believe this new method significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of subglacial lake discovery and also holds promise for extending to the detection and labeling of more types of subglacial environments in Antarctica.
This research was jointly conducted by teams from PRIC, the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and the Southern University of Science and Technology.
According to current statistics, scientists worldwide have discovered a total of 675 subglacial lakes beneath the Antarctic ice sheet, with three of them successfully drilled and sampled.

Based on the perspective of lunar dynamic evolution, Chinese researchers creatively established an updated lunar geological time scale, objectively depicting the geological evolution of the moon, and clearly showing the characteristics of lunar tectonic and magmatic evolution.
The atlas set has been integrated into the digital lunar cloud platform built by Chinese scientists, and will serve lunar scientific research and science education, as well as landing site selection, lunar resource exploration and path planning for China's future lunar exploration projects, Liu said.
He said the upcoming Chang'e 6 mission is expected to collect samples in the Apollo Basin within the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon, which means materials ejected from ancient terrain may be collected in the process.
""Our map can provide a macroscopic geological background to improve the purpose and efficiency of the sample research,"" Liu said.
Gregory Michael, a senior scientist at the Free University of Berlin in Germany, said the compilation of the atlas was an immense project, which required the organization and cooperation of many well-informed Chinese researchers over many years to be able to achieve a consistent and complete result.
""This map, in particular, is the first on a global scale to utilize all of the post-Apollo era data,"" he said.""It builds on the achievements of the international community over the last decades, as well as on China's own highly successful Chang'e program. It will be a starting point for every new question of lunar geology, and become a primary resource for researchers studying lunar processes of all kinds.""

Next-gen telecom to turbocharge China's new productivity,2024-04-20,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0420/c90000-20159225.html,"Home>>
		
Next-gen telecom to turbocharge China's new productivity
 (Xinhua) 15:30, April 20, 2024
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China is pushing for the convergence of next-generation communication with technologies such as big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to empower various industries and development of new quality productive forces.
With innovation playing the leading role, new quality productive forces means advanced productivity that is freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths, features high-tech, high efficiency and high quality.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has reported that 5G applications have been successfully integrated into 74 of the 97 major sectors of the national economy.
This includes significant advancements in key areas such as industry, mining, power, and healthcare, where 5G is being promoted on a large scale.
Zhao Zhiguo, chief engineer of the MIIT, stated that 5G is currently progressing towards 5G-Advanced (5GA) or 5.5G, and there is an increased focus on the research and development of 6G and terabit optical networks.
According to a research by Zhongtai Securities, 5G-A is poised to become a cornerstone for the low-altitude economy, offering comprehensive information services that include lifecycle management, intelligent decision support, security, and AI-assisted drone supervision.
These capabilities are essential for the safe and efficient operation of low-altitude flights, a burgeoning sector within the economy and an example of developing new quality productive forces.
New quality productive forces are driven by revolutionary technological breakthroughs, innovative allocation of production factors, and deep industrial transformation and upgrading. A prime example is the emergence of futuristic industries.
The MIIT and several other departments have issued a guideline on the innovation and development of humanoid robots as part of efforts to encourage development of new quality productive forces, said Shan Zhongde, vice minister of industry and information technology.
A research note from Guosheng Securities said the humanoid robot market is expected to surpass the trillion-yuan mark in market scale in the future, with 6G playing a significant role in this growth. It will be capable of supporting intelligent dialogue and training for robots by gradually enhancing their level of intelligence.
The research suggests that 6G will boast features such as ultra-high speed, ultra-low latency, global coverage, massive connectivity, ultra-high reliability, and ultra-low energy consumption. It is expected to fuel development of game-changing technologies like quantum communication.
Smart manufacturing is the core technology and main focus that will enable the transformation of China's manufacturing industry from being large in scale to becoming stronger in capability and competitiveness, said Shan.
To this end, China is improving infrastructure including moderately and proactively planning for the deployment of information infrastructure such as 5G, computing power, and mobile Internet of Things (IoT).
In March, the world's first 400G all-optical interprovincial backbone network officially became commercially available in China.
Compared to the previous generation of backbone networks, its transmission bandwidth has increased by four times, and the energy consumption per bit has been reduced by 65 percent. Data volumes that would previously take ten minutes to transmit can now be completed in just over two minutes thanks to the new network developed by China Mobile.
It is expected that by mid-2024, the company will fully realize high-speed interconnection between the eight hubs of an initiative channeling computing resources from the country's east to the west, establishing the world's largest 400G all-optical interprovincial backbone network.
Zhao emphasized that the commercial operation of the 400G network will better support the efficient interconnection of computing power and data elements across entities, types, and regions.
An industry report from a broadband development alliance indicates that China has built the world's largest and technologically leading ""dual-gigabit"" network infrastructure, achieving gigabit access in every city, 5G access in every county, and broadband access in every village.
The telecom industry in China has developed rapidly in recent years. As of the end of March, the cumulative number of 5G base stations built nationwide has reached 3.647 million, with a 5G user penetration rate exceeding 60 percent, according to MIIT data.
As China continues to lift market access restrictions in the manufacturing sector, it will also promote the opening up of sectors including telecommunications to create more trade and investment opportunities for foreign investors.
In its latest move to expand opening up, China said that it will remove foreign ownership restrictions on some value-added telecom services provided within domestic pilot areas.
By the end of March this year, 1,926 foreign-funded enterprises had been approved to operate telecommunications businesses in China.
By aligning itself with high-standard international economic and trade rules, the country aims to stimulate the vitality of market entities and share the development dividends of its digital economy with the world, said Wang Zhiqin, deputy director of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.

""Bridge"" in place, China ready to sample on moon's far side
 (Xinhua) 09:20, April 20, 2024
Queqiao-2 is expected to serve as a vital communication link between Earth-based controllers and the Chang'e-6 probe, which will be launched in the first half of this year to collect samples from the far side of the moon.
Scientists believe that samples from the far side of the moon have greater research value.
Aside from Chang'e-6, China also plans to launch Chang'e-7 in 2026 and Chang'e-8 in 2028. Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 will form the basic model of a lunar research station to carry out lunar environment exploration.
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- As China is determined to drive economic growth via sci-tech innovations, it also casts its wisdom and courage in exploring Earth's closest neighbor -- the moon. This year, it plans to retrieve lunar samples from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history.
To carry out this unprecedented mission, it first launched Queqiao-2, a new relay satellite, on March 20 to provide Earth-Moon communications services. The satellite has recently entered its target elliptical orbit around the moon and completed in-orbit communication tests, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
Queqiao, meaning magpie bridge, derives its name from a Chinese folktale, in which magpies formed a bridge across the Milky Way with their wings to help a separated couple reunite. In reality, Queqiao-2 is expected to serve as a vital communication link between Earth-based controllers and the Chang'e-6 probe, which will be launched in the first half of this year to collect samples from the mysterious far side of the moon.
As the moon's revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle, the same side always faces Earth. The other face, most of which cannot be seen from Earth, is called the far side or ""dark side"" of the moon. This term doesn't refer to darkness but rather to the mystery shrouding the moon's largely unexplored terrain.
In order to unravel the mystery, China launched the Chang'e-4 probe, which realized the first-ever soft landing and roving on the far side of the moon at the beginning of 2019. Before that, all relevant knowledge came from speculation based on remote-sensing images.

China launched its first Queqiao satellite in 2018 to support communications and data transmission between Chang'e-4 and Earth. But the first relay satellite has exceeded its designed lifespan. Now, the more powerful Queqiao-2 satellite will take over its communications relay services.
As a backup of the Chang'e-5 probe, Chang'e-6 is set to collect approximately 2 kilograms of lunar samples by shoveling and drilling. The probe will also conduct scientific investigations within the designated landing zone situated in the South Pole-Aitken Basin.
The mission will demand a series of breakthroughs in key technologies, such as automatic sample collection, take-off and ascent from the far side of the moon.
Scientists believe that samples from the far side of the moon have greater research value. Unlike the relatively low-lying and flat terrains found on the near side, the far side has higher elevations and is more densely covered with craters. It suggests that the far side has been subjected to a longer history of impacts, indicating an older geological age for in-depth exploration.
Li Ting and her research team from the Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, discovered from the Chang'e-5 samples a new mineral, Changesite-(Y). She is much looking forward to samples from the moon's ""fresh and unfamiliar"" far side.
""If Chang'e-6 can get some older lunar samples exposed after impacts or residues of meteorites and asteroids, it may bring us more deep space information,"" said Li.
Humans have been curious and imaginative about the moon since ancient times. Li Bai, a renowned poet from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), once wrote a poem to ask when the moon appeared in the blue sky. In fact, the origin of the moon has not only inspired romantic sentiments among literati and scholars throughout history, but also remained a focus of research in the field of lunar science.
In the 16th century, people started using telescopes to observe the moon. In January 1959, the Soviet Union launched the Luna 1 probe, the world's first lunar exploration satellite. In October 2007, China achieved a milestone with the successful launch of the Chang'e-1 satellite, marking the country's inaugural lunar exploration mission.
From the United States' Apollo 11 mission in 1969 to China's Chang'e-5 mission in 2020, humans have accomplished a total of 10 lunar sampling missions. The initial nine samplings all took place during the 1960s and 1970s. Following a 44-year hiatus, Chang'e-5 retrieved 1.731 kilograms of lunar samples, opening a new chapter in cutting-edge lunar research.

The lunar rocks and soil encapsulate the key to decoding the mysteries of billions of years of transformations on the moon. Nearly all our understanding of the moon's inception and development stems from the study of lunar samples, said Yang Wei, researcher with the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
A widely accepted theory in the scientific community believes that approximately 4.5 billion years ago, a Mars-sized celestial body known as Theia collided with nascent Earth. The collision caused debris to be ejected into space, which eventually coalesced around Earth to form the moon. This hypothesis owes much to the analysis of lunar samples collected during the United States and Soviet Union lunar missions, Yang said.
Different from previous nine missions which focus on low-latitude areas, Chang'e-5 targeted mid-latitude regions of the moon. With advanced microanalysis technologies, scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries from the study of lunar soil retrieved by Chang'e-5.
According to the CNSA, one of the most notable research results dated the youngest rock on the moon at around 2 billion years in age, extending the ""life"" of lunar volcanism 800-900 million years longer than previously known.
In the following studies, Chinese scientists further revealed a new mechanism for how young volcanoes took shape on the moon and new clues about the moon's water resources.
The new lunar mineral Changesite-(Y), the first discovered by China and the sixth by humankind, makes China the third country in the world to have discovered a new mineral on the moon.
Li Ting and her team made this great discovery on a single-crystal particle with a radius of about 10 microns, which was only one 200th to 300th the size of a sesame seed. It was isolated from 140,000 tiny lunar particles of about 15-milligram Chang'e-5 samples.
Through the meticulous analysis by Li's team, this imperceptible particle became an essential piece of the moon's geological puzzle. ""Planets are composed of interconnected puzzle pieces. Each new mineral we uncover adds a fresh dimension to their intricate pattern, bearing historical imprints of their formative environments,"" Li said.
For example, Changesite-(Y) is rich in rare earth elements and its magnesium to iron ratio is different from previously identified same subgroup minerals, reflecting the unique characteristics of the Chang'e-5 landing site, Li said.
However, the ""puzzle pieces"" obtained by human missions remain notably restricted. So far, all 10 sampling missions have been focused on the near side of the moon. If the first nine sampling sites were to be connected to form a polygon, it would merely account for 4.4 percent of the lunar surface. Even with the Chang'e-5 samples, their representativeness is still far from sufficient, Yang said.

""In our geological research on Earth, we will strive to gather the most fundamental data whenever exploring a new location. However, in the case of the moon, humanity has only obtained samples from a handful of sites, with none from high-latitude regions or the far side. Therefore, from a geological perspective, the moon remains a vastly uncharted territory,"" Li said.
Aside from Chang'e-6, China also plans to launch Chang'e-7 in 2026 and Chang'e-8 in 2028. Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 will form the basic model of a lunar research station to carry out lunar environment exploration.
The landing and sampling sites of China's moon missions in the coming years are mainly in the lunar south pole region or on the far side of the moon, the CNSA said.
""Building a research station on the moon, and exploring deeper space using the moon as a base, was once an imagination in science fictions. Now, it may become a reality in my lifetime,"" Li said.

After sowing seeds in early April, farmer Wang Tousheng from Bizhou township, Suichuan county, east China's Jiangxi province, would come to the paddy field every few days to check on the growth of the ""space lotus"".
""Space-traveled lotus seeds have unique qualities. With a yield of 500 kilograms and a gross income of 6,000 yuan ($828.95) per mu (one mu equals 0.07 hectares), it's truly a get-rich lotus."" said Wang.
The ""space lotus"" Wang referred to is a product of aerospace breeding, known as the ""Space Lotus No. 36."" It has been planted on a total area of more than 20 million mu, accounting for over 80 percent of the total cultivation area of white lotus seeds in China.
""In space breeding, also referred to as aerospace breeding, seeds are sent on a return capsule to space, where they are exposed to specific conditions such as cosmic radiation, microgravity, and high vacuum to induce genetic mutations. After the seeds return to the Earth, we pick out the beneficial mutations that can be inherited to breed new plant varieties with high quality, high yields, and multiple resistances,"" said Liu Luxiang, Party Secretary of the Institute of Crop Sciences under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and chief scientist of China's space breeding program.
In August 1987, China's ninth recoverable satellite carried seeds of rice, chili pepper, and other crops into space, marking the first ""space travel"" of Chinese seeds. So far China has conducted over 3,000 experiments on space breeding, and developed more than 260 approved varieties of staple crops, and over 100 new varieties of vegetables, fruits, forestry, and flowers.
Space breeding increased grain production by over 2 billion kilograms annually in China, and generated direct economic benefits exceeding 100 billion yuan.

At the China (Shouguang) International Vegetable Sci-Tech Fair in Shouguang, ""China's hometown of vegetables"" located in east China's Shandong province, the aviation breeding exhibition area of the Hall No. 10 showcases thriving tomatoes, eggplants, and chili peppers.
""Here you can find 13 new varieties that represent the achievements of China's space breeding. These varieties are characterized by their high yield, high quality, early maturity, and robust disease resistance,"" said Ma Zunjuan, manager of the exhibition hall.
Not every seed sent into space experiences a miraculous transformation. Even if they spend a week or 27 days at most in space, the chances of them changing are only a few thousandths or even ten thousandths.
""The overarching goal, whether through space breeding or alternative methods, is to generate and select mutations, and then make use of the mutation process. And the focus of breeding specialists is on developing space seeds for better yields, quality, and nutrition,"" Liu explained.
To cultivate a mature variety, it typically takes a minimum of 8 to 10 years. Throughout the lengthy breeding process, the seeds must undergo rigorous testing for yield, resistance, quality, and market value. The occurrence of a problem at any stage can potentially undo all previous efforts.
""A large number of strains are eliminated during tests, leaving only a very small proportion classified as space seeds, certified or acknowledged by professional institutions,"" Liu told People's Daily.

By employing space breeding technology, China has managed to produce a variety of high-yielding and high-quality new crop strains in rice, wheat, cotton, and vegetables.
For instance, II Youhang 1, a nationally accredited super rice variety, has made advancements in both yield and quality, setting and maintaining the world record for regenerated rice yield per 100 mu.
In 2021, Hangmai 802, a high-yielding and high-quality wheat variety, was certified in north China's Hebei province. It features outstanding salt tolerance, strong resistance to various diseases, and adaptability to diverse conditions. In 2022, Hangmai 106 was approved in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. In addition to strong resistance to powdery mildew, leaf rust, and stripe rust, it is also rich in dietary fiber.
The carrier of seed materials plays a key role in space breeding. In 2006, China established a national space breeding collaboration group, which worked with relevant parties to initiate the space breeding program. The first seed-breeding satellite, ""Shijian-8,"" was launched as a result.
In 2024, the collaboration group is scheduled to collaborate with the China Academy of Space Technology to launch the second satellite dedicated to space breeding, as part of China's recoverable satellite project. Besides, China's research on space mutagenesis mechanisms has seen significant strides by using ground-based high-energy accelerators to simulate cosmic particles.
""The establishment of our space station marks the start of space breeding in space stations,"" said Liu. By developing extravehicular equipment and technology for space radiation biology, breeding experts can engage in space-induced mutagenesis breeding and thereby establish a new space breeding system based on the space station.

Chinese scientists use AI algorithm to better predict unknown tumor origins
 (Xinhua) 13:09, April 19, 2024
TIANJIN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists have designed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that predicts hard-to-identify tumor origins with an accuracy rivaling or even surpassing human pathologists.
Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) site poses challenges to clinicians due to its elusive nature. The CUP, which accounts for 3 percent to 5 percent of all cancers diagnosed in humans, tends to be malignant, with only 20 percent of CUP patients achieving a median survival of 10 months.
The researchers, led by those from Tianjin Medical University and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, developed a deep-learning method for tumor origin differentiation, trained via cytological images from 57,220 cases at four Chinese hospitals.
The tool called TORCH can identify malignant tumors in fluids accumulated in chest and abdomen and predict their origins, according to the study published this week in the journal Nature Medicine.
TORCH achieved a prediction accuracy for primary tumor origins of 82.6 percent, significantly improving the diagnostic scores compared with four human pathologists, according to the study.
Also, the treatment protocol given in conforming with TORCH-predicted origins resulted in an overall survival of 27 months as against 17 months for those who were administrated discordant treatment.
The study highlighted the AI system's potential as a valuable ancillary tool in clinical practice, although further validation in randomized trials is demanded, said the researchers.
