Chinese agricultural hub nurtures talent for SCO member states
 (Xinhua) 14:47, June 13, 2024
XI'AN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Just as the mythic hero Hou Ji is said to have taught the Chinese people how to grow grain in the Yangling region some 4,000 years ago, this agricultural hub today continues to be a beacon of agricultural knowledge.
Over the past five years, more than 2,200 agricultural officials and technicians from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) countries have received training at the SCO Demonstration Base for Agricultural Technology Exchange and Training in Yangling, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
In addition to hands-on training, the base has also delivered specialized agricultural technology lectures, attracting over 40,000 online learners.
These figures were released during the annual symposium of the China Center for SCO Studies held on Wednesday in the Yangling Agricultural Hi-tech Industrial Demonstration Zone.
The event drew over 100 experts, scholars, and business leaders, underscoring the base's role in fostering international cooperation in agriculture.
Chen Bo, director of the China Center for SCO Studies, emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts among member countries to address common risks and challenges.
""In terms of food security, for example, their complementary advantages provide a solid foundation for cooperation. Future opportunities lie in areas such as food production, foreign trade, and agricultural talent and technology exchanges,"" said Wei Feng from Northwest A&F University.
With less than 9 percent of the world's arable land, China produces around a quarter of the world's grain and feeds about a fifth of the global population.
China has been an active participant in global food and agriculture governance, engaging in agricultural science and technology exchanges with more than 140 countries and regions. China has also promoted over 1,000 agricultural technologies and trained more than 14,000 hybrid rice specialists in developing countries.
Covering an area of about 135 square km, Yangling is located approximately 80 km to the west of Shaanxi's capital, Xi'an, where the ancient Silk Road started. Known for its deep-rooted agricultural civilization, Yangling has witnessed deepening agricultural cooperation under the SCO framework in recent years.

Chinese researchers use gene editing to combat wheat ""cancer""
 (Xinhua) 10:19, June 13, 2024
XI'AN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A research team from China has employed gene editing technology to improve wheat resistance to stripe rust, an airborne fungal disease described as ""cancer"" for this crop.
The research team, led by Prof. Wang Xiaojie from Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, in their 18-year-long study found a susceptible gene in wheat, named TaPsIPK1, which confers susceptibility to the stripe rust pathogen, with the results published online in the journal Cell in 2022.
A recent field experiment conducted by the team showed that the stripe rust resistance of the cultivar with edited TaPsIPK1 was enhanced from high susceptibility to medium or high resistance, and also revealed that this could be done without significant difference in yield.
Notably, the cultivar retained the agronomic traits of the original variety, showing great potential for application.
Going forward, the research team will work on wheat synchronous resistance to stripe rust, powdery mildew and gibberellic disease through gene editing.
This is an important step in efforts to achieve green and high-quality agricultural development and ensure food security, Wang noted.

BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A recent photo of the Chinese Chang'e-6 probe's lander-ascender combination on the far side of the moon has captured a historic moment in human lunar exploration.
The photograph was taken by a mini rover that was carried to the moon by the Chang'e-6 mission.
The probe has collected samples from the moon's far side and is currently in lunar orbit, awaiting the optimal time for its return journey.
The autonomous, intelligent mini robot was attached to the lander during the mission's journey to the moon and its moon landing, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), its developer.
After Chang'e-6 collected the samples on the far side of the moon, the mini rover autonomously detached from the lander, moved to a suitable position, selected an ideal angle for the photograph, and then captured the image.
At approximately 5 kilograms, the mini rover is much lighter than Yutu, China's first lunar rover, which was roughly equivalent in weight to two adults.
Despite its compact size, the mini rover is highly capable and has significantly enhanced autonomous intelligence, CASC said.
Its innovative action marks a significant stride forward in the development of autonomous intelligence in China's deep space exploration endeavors, promising a positive influence on future lunar exploration, CASC added.

Understanding sand movement to safeguard NW China's railway artery,2024-06-12,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0612/c90000-20180619.html,"Home>>
		
Understanding sand movement to safeguard NW China's railway artery
By Hu Tao, Zhang Wenjing (Xinhua) 16:15, June 12, 2024
LANZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are endeavoring to safeguard the smooth and safe operation of a high-speed railway in the windy Gobi Desert by better understanding the movement of sand.
New progress has been made in revealing the sediment movement by strong winds along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang high-speed railway, one of northwest China's railway arteries, according to the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources (NIEER) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The new study is of practical importance to the safe operation of such an important railway artery. Moreover, it could serve as a theoretical foundation for preventing and managing eolian disasters along this railway, said NIEER researcher Liu Benli.
The 1,776-km high-speed railway links Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with Gansu Province's capital Lanzhou. It spans Xinjiang and the provinces of Qinghai and Gansu in the country's vast northwestern region.
It is also the country's first high-speed railway through four major wind areas of the Gobi Desert.
Under strong wind conditions over vast Gobi surfaces, eolian transportation can cause significant environmental problems and infrastructural damage. However, scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of this process in the Gobi region remains limited, according to Liu.
Therefore, it is of practical and academic importance to investigate and better understand the eolian transportation over the Gobi surface along this railway.
The NIEER researchers selected one of the windy areas along the railway to carry out field observation on the transportation process of wind-blown sand on the Gobi surface.
The study results indicate that sand transportation heights can reach 9 meters in this region, with the saltation layer approximately three to six times higher than that of other gravel deserts.
The study provides insight into the wind-blown sand movement mechanism over the surface of Gobi Desert under strong winds, according to NIEER associate researcher Wang Tao.
It also proposes suggestions to current wind-blown sand protection system of this railway.
According to the study results, the annual eolian transported quantity recorded in this region exceeds that of most deserts worldwide. Notably, fine sand and total suspended particulates contributed to around 90 percent of the sediment deposited on railway tracks and drawn in by passing trains.
""To control transportation of these fine particles, we propose increasing the height of sand-blocking fences within the current railway wind-blown sand protection system from two to three meters,"" said Wang.
Simultaneously, anthropogenic damage to the Gobi surface should be minimized to reduce excessive dust release, he added.
The results of the study have been published in the journal Land Degradation & Development.

Researchers suggest gut microbiome modulates people's age
 (Xinhua) 15:11, June 12, 2024
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have proposed that gut microbiome is an important factor in determining the age of a human body and revealed its potential impact on regulating metabolic aging, according to a recent research article published in the journal Nature Medicine.
Insight into the associations between the gut microbiome, metabolism and aging is crucial for tailoring interventions aimed at promoting healthy longevity, the article noted.
Researchers from the Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and BGI Research conducted a study involving 10,207 individuals aged between 40 and 93. Using 21 metabolic parameters, they categorized those individuals into five clusters, termed metabolic multimorbidity clusters, that represent different metabolic subphenotypes.
Compared to the cluster classified as metabolically healthy, clusters classified as ""obesity-related mixed"" and ""hyperglycemia"" exhibited an increased 11.1-year cardiovascular disease risk by 75 percent and 117 percent, respectively. These associations were replicated in a second cohort of 9,061 individuals with a 10-year follow-up.
Through in-depth analysis of the fecal metagenomic data of 4,491 randomly selected individuals, the researchers found that gut microbial composition was associated with both metabolic multimorbidity clusters and age.
Among individuals aged 60 years or above, the increased cardiovascular disease risk associated with ""obesity-related mixed"" clusters or ""hyperglycemia"" clusters was exacerbated in individuals with high gut microbial age but diminished in individuals with low gut microbial age, independent of factors like age, gender, lifestyle and diet.
This pattern, in which younger gut microbial age appears to counteract the cardiovascular disease risk attributable to metabolic dysfunction, implies a modulating role of gut microbial age in cardiovascular health for metabolically unhealthy older people.
The results suggested that gut microbial age as a biomarker might be a promising predictor of cardiovascular disease risk.

BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have established a platform for the discovery, utilization, and innovation of superior genes from wild rice germplasm, according to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).
The study, jointly conducted by researchers from the CAAS and the School of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University, has been published in the journal Nature Communications.
The abundant genetic variation harbored by wild rice has provided a reservoir of useful genes for rice breeding. However, the genome of wild rice has not yet been comprehensively assessed.
The research team used Chinese common wild rice Y476, known for its comprehensive resistance, as a carrier to assemble a haplotype-resolved gapless chromosome genome for the first time.
The researchers developed two sets of chromosome segment substitution lines using Y476 as the donor parent and cultivated rice as the recurrent parents. Moreover, they established a platform that can efficiently and quickly discover superior genes in wild rice.
The platform will accelerate functional genomics research in wild rice and provide advanced tools for the utilization of rice germplasm resources and genetic improvement of rice varieties, said Yang Qingwen, a researcher from the team.

Ten candidates, including eight space pilots, as well as two payload specialists respectively from Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, have been selected for China's fourth batch of taikonauts, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) announced on Tuesday.
This is the first time it has selected payload specialists in Hong Kong and Macao, the CMSA said.
John Lee, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, told a press conference on Tuesday that it marks a glorious moment in Hong Kong's history as it is the first time a local resident has become a payload specialist in the national space program, with the opportunity to travel to space.
Lee added that this embodies three significances: first, the One Country, Two Systems principle allows Hong Kong residents to participate; second, it highlights the country's emphasis on the scientific research and development of Hong Kong; third, it demonstrates the determination and perseverance of Hong Kong youth to achieve their dreams.
Huang Weifen, chief designer behind the China manned space program's taikonaut system, noted that the payload specialists from Hong Kong and Macao have successfully navigated the rigorous selection process, which includes clinical medical examinations, various physiological function tests, endurance selection for adaptation to the aerospace environment, as well as psychological tests. They have met all of the selection criteria, Huang said, China Central Television reported.
These candidates will undergo comprehensive and systematic training at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center. According to Huang, the formation of the taikonaut team, with a focus on both the selection and training processes, has taken into account the preparation for the two significant missions of space station and manned lunar landing, given that China plans to achieve manned lunar landing and scientific exploration before 2030.
With the completion of the training simulator for the manned lunar mission, taikonauts will be able to effectively carry out related training tasks, Huang said.
China has completed four rounds of taikonauts selection. A total of 14 taikonauts from air force pilots were selected in 1998, with an additional seven selected in 2010, including two female taikonauts. In 2020, it completed the selection of the third batch of 18 taikonauts, which included space pilots, flight engineers and payload specialists, while the selection of the fourth batch of Chinese astronaut candidates began in the second half of 2022, according to Xinhua News Agency.
The candidate pool for taikonauts is constantly expanding, and the criteria for taikonauts are continuously being adjusted, and the corresponding selection methods are also being continuously optimized and improved, Huang said.
The CMSA said that China's astronaut selection and training system has become more sophisticated and well-established. As international cooperation in crewed space exploration deepens, foreign astronauts will be invited to participate in the selection and training process, and subsequently carry out missions in China's space station.

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have recently obtained the continuous observation data of tropospheric atmosphere over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau for the first time.
The study is carried out by a research team of the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research (ITP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and has obtained observation data for three consecutive years over the plateau, according to the ITP.
In 2021, China established a ground-based microwave radiometers (MWRs) network for the tropospheric atmosphere over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau to conduct real-time and continuous unattended observation under almost all weather conditions. Its observation data has been opened to the public.
The MWRs network can precisely measure the temperature and humidity of the plateau tropospheric atmosphere, and monitor changes of the hydrothermal structure of the plateau tropospheric atmosphere, according to ITP researcher Ma Yaoming.
In addition to supporting the study of weather processes on the plateau, the observation data will also provide support for the study of global climate change, Ma added.
The continuous temperature and moisture profiles derived from the MWR data provide a unique perspective on the evolution of the thermodynamic structure associated with the heating of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, according to the study.
The results of the study have been published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.

Chinese researchers uncover driving source of umbral waves in sunspots
 (Xinhua) 16:33, June 11, 2024
KUNMING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently studied the structure of chromospheric umbral waves in sunspots and discovered the driving source of umbral waves, according to the Yunnan Observatories under Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Oscillations are ubiquitous in sunspots and the associated higher atmospheres. However, it is still unclear whether these oscillations are driven by the external acoustic waves or generated by the internal magnetoconvection.
Researchers studied the fine structure of chromospheric umbral waves in two sunspots by using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and data from other telescopes.
They found for the first time that two one-armed spiral wave patterns coexist in the umbra, and they can rotate either in the same or opposite directions.
Furthermore, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the oscillation centers of the one-armed spiral wave patterns within the umbra, they found that the chromospheric umbral waves repeatedly originate from the regions with high oscillation power and most of the umbral waves occur in the dark nuclei and strong magnetic field regions of the umbra.
The study results indicate that the chromospheric umbral waves are likely reacting to the external acoustic waves oscillations.
The study has been published in the journal Solar Physics.

BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The first cylindrical floating oil-gas production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility in Asia, named ""Haikui No. 1"", has been successfully installed at sea, its owner China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) announced on Monday.
This achievement marks a significant breakthrough for China in installing floating facilities in deepwater oil and gas fields, according to CNOOC, the largest offshore oil and gas producer in China.
""Haikui No. 1"" is a self-developed cylindrical FPSO facility from China. It is installed in the sea area of the Liuhua Oilfield in the Pearl River Mouth Basin, located more than 320 meters deep and about 240 kilometers southeast of Shenzhen.
Weighing a total of 37,000 tonnes and towering at a height of approximately 30 floors, ""Haikui No. 1"" integrates functions of crude oil production, storage, and offloading. It consists of nearly 600,000 components and the size of its main deck is equivalent to that of 13 standard basketball courts. It has a maximum oil storage capacity of 60,000 tonnes, according to CNOOC.
Wang Huoping, deputy general manager of the Liuhua Oilfield development project at the CNOOC Shenzhen branch, said this is the first time that China has conducted offshore installation of cylindrical marine equipment.
With a design life of 30 years, ""Haikui No. 1"" is capable of continuous sea operation for 15 years without the need for docking.
Compared to the conventional ship-shaped structure of the FPSO unit, the cylindrical structure design offers advantages such as reduced steel usage, higher oil storage efficiency, and it is better equipped to withstand harsh sea conditions. This effectively improves the economic viability and reduces the cost of oilfield development and operations, said Wang.
However, due to its high center of gravity and large windward area, the cylindrical structure is prone to rotation, making offshore installation extremely challenging, he added.
To ensure the stability of ""Haikui No. 1"" in the turbulent sea, 12 sets of deepwater suction anchors, independently designed and built by China, were installed on the seabed. These anchors are connected by 12 mooring legs. Each leg is 2,570 meters long, with a breaking load of 2,300 tonnes.
This mooring system acts as underwater mooring piles, firmly securing ""Haikui No. 1"" at the sea, said Wang.

BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union should avoid trade frictions with China and it is necessary for both sides to seek consensus on new-energy cooperation, according to industry insiders and analysts citing the multi-billion-dollar market opportunities and the global climate goals.
The automotive cooperation between China and Germany on green transformation and intelligent connectivity is vitally important, said Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry. She encourages the two parties to continue to be crucial partners in achieving climate goals.
""I believe that the two markets should be closely linked,"" she said, adding that Chinese companies are welcome in Germany. As for the German side, its carmakers have shown interest not only in exporting but also in producing in China, she added.
For European carmakers, including auto giants BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, China stands out as the largest single market.
In the first quarter, about one-third of BMW's sales revenue came from China. The country also hosts BMW Group's largest R&D center outside Germany.
""The innovations we achieve in China allow us to continuously meet the needs of Chinese customers, thereby driving global innovation,"" said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG.
The expanding foothold of Chinese companies on the European continent underscores the strengthening ties between the two sides. In April, China's Chery Automobile signed a pact with Spain's auto company Ebro-EV Motors to produce cars at its first European factory. According to Reuters, this move is expected to help recover some of the 1,600 direct jobs lost when Japanese automaker Nissan shut down a plant in 2021.
Yan Shaohua, an associate research fellow at the Center for China-Europe Relations of Fudan University, said that China's electric vehicle (EV) makers venturing into European countries have helped boost the development of the local EV industry chain and accelerate the digital and green transitions in these countries.
China and the EU are each other's second-largest trading partners. Official data showed that their average trade value approached nearly 1.5 million U.S. dollars per minute, while two-way investment exceeded 250 billion dollars.
For Europe, China also plays a pivotal role as a major supplier of raw materials such as photovoltaic cells and wind turbines, all critical components for the EU given its ambitious goal of becoming the ""world's first climate-neutral continent"" by 2050.
About 98 percent of the EU's rare earth is imported from China, and more than 93 percent of its magnesium is also sourced from China, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both materials are indispensable in auto parts manufacturing.
Despite the ups and downs of China-EU relations in recent years, cooperation has remained the prevailing theme of bilateral ties. The industrial sector, supply chains and value chains of the two sides are tightly woven together, rending them inseparable from each other.
While visiting Europe this week, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao pointed out that protectionist measures are not viable solutions but a ""dangerous dead-end.""
""China is willing to engage in discussions with the EU on economic and trade concerns on an equal footing and participate in fair competition on the basis of expanded cooperation,"" Wang said.
Both the EU and China have the responsibility to reach a consensus through negotiations and strike a balance between cooperation and competition, said Spanish economist Julio Ceballos Rodriguez. He stressed that the two sides are dependent on each other in many key issues and share important economic interests.
Kou Kou, an associate professor of German studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, cited artificial intelligence, electronic information, aerospace and other emerging industries as areas of great cooperation potential for both sides to tap.
""China and the EU are set to witness closer ties on multiple fronts in the future, a trend that will not be easily changed by a few politicians,"" Kou said.

China makes big strides in new energy vehicle development with innovation
By Wang Zheng (People's Daily) 10:42, June 10, 2024
On May 14, Leapmotor International, a joint venture established by Leapmotor, a Chinese maker of electric vehicles, and Stellantis, a multinational auto company headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, began operation. Four months later, two pure electric models of Leapmotor will be exported to nine European countries including France, Italy and Germany.
On May 20, German carmaker Audi and Chinese car manufacturer SAIC Motor announced to jointly develop a new platform for intelligent and electric vehicles.
The increasing international cooperation exactly mirrors China's leading position in the development of new energy vehicles (NEVs) worldwide.

In recent years, the Chinese automotive industry, striving to manufacture electrified, intelligent, and connected products, has been actively promoting innovation in technologies, products, and business models.
In 2023, China's sales of NEVs exceeded 9.49 million units, nearly 126 times compared to 2014 and accounting for over 60 percent of the global market share, ranking first globally for nine consecutive years. The proportion of NEVs in China's annual sales of automobiles has increased to 31.6 percent.
However, 10 years ago, the global NEV industry was still an emerging sector heavily reliant on charging infrastructure and had yet to achieve commercialization. Numerous obstacles stood in the way of its progress, such as underdeveloped technologies, potential safety concerns regarding batteries, high production costs, poor user experience, and an untapped market.

Fu Bingfeng, executive vice president and secretary-general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), attributed the huge achievements of the Chinese NEV industry to the country's forward-looking and highly practical industrial policies, and its strategic efforts to advance future-oriented charging infrastructure.
He said that the technological innovation made by the industry and relevant enterprises as well as the vast Chinese market also contributed significantly to such achievements.
In the past decade, China has introduced over 70 policies and measures to bolster its NEV industry. It has established a complete and coordinated industrial system, fostered the world's largest market for NEV consumption, and built a favorable environment in which the NEV sector and relevant industries mutually reinforce each other through win-win cooperation.

""We have installed a charging pole at home, which makes charging incredibly affordable. Over the past six months, I have saved at least 10,000 yuan compared to driving a fuel-powered car,"" Wei told People's Daily.
If favorable policies were what propelled NEV sales in the early stage of the industry development, then the increasingly convenient and diversified charging modes and low charging costs have become the market catalysts sustaining the rapid and continued growth of China's NEV industry after the phase-out of subsidies in 2023.
China has built the world's largest and most extensive-coverage charging infrastructure network. As of the end of 2023, the number of NEV charging facilities in China has grown 65 percent year on year, reaching almost 8.6 million.
Besides, China has witnessed continuous extension of industrial chains in power battery recycling and reuse, cascade utilization, and material regeneration. More than 10,000 power battery recycling service outlets have been built across the country, making local recycling possible.
Recently, a Chinese extended-range vehicle drove 2,141.4 kilometers from Wuhu, southeast China's Anhui province, to Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, without recharging or refueling during a livestream event, which attracted massive attention.
Notably, the vehicle, manufactured by Exeed, the premium brand of Chinese automaker Chery Automobile Co., Ltd., completed the challenge in 42.5 hours with a full load.
Huang Zhaogen, assistant general manager of Chery, said the challenge set a new record for the maximum range achieved by Chinese NEVs, thanks to Chery's technological innovation.
To alleviate the range anxiety of users and make charging more convenient, Chinese NEV companies have kept developing new technologies and business models, and upgrading their core technologies. Besides, they have made progress in intelligent connected vehicle technologies.
For example, Jidu Auto, a joint venture between Chinese carmaker Geely and tech giant Baidu, launched its first artificial intelligence-powered electric vehicle called Jiyue 01 last year. The model is equipped with Baidu's integrated AI system Ernie Bot, a large language model. At the 2024 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition, Geely exhibited the world's first AI digital chassis.
According to statistics, 56.2 percent of passenger vehicles sold in China in the first quarter of 2024 were equipped with Level 2 or above driver assistance systems. Besides, 81.5 percent of the vehicles came with navigation systems and 87.9 percent had voice control systems.
Intelligent factories, fully-connected 5G factories, and green factories are springing up across China. Empowered by digital technologies, China's NEVs are of better quality, making new strides in high-end, intelligent, and green development.
""In the first four months of this year, China's NEV production and sales reached 2.985 million and 2.94 million units respectively, a year-on-year growth of 30.3 percent and 32.3 percent,"" Fu told People's Daily.
The CAAM predicted that the production and sales of NEVs in China will make new records and exceed 10 million units this year, Fu added.

China reaps fruitful results in international polar expedition cooperation
By Liu Shiyao (People's Daily) 10:26, June 10, 2024
China's 40th Antarctic expedition successfully concluded as Xuelong, the country's first domestically built polar icebreaker, returned to a port in Qingdao, east China's Shandong province on April 10.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's polar expedition. Over the past four decades, China has continuously strengthened its comprehensive capabilities in polar expedition and actively cooperated with relevant countries, making significant contributions to better understanding, protecting, and utilizing the polar regions.

As a roaring sound grew closer, a red and white Snow Eagle 601, China's first fixed-wing aircraft for polar flight, touched down on the airport of the Zhongshan Station, a Chinese scientific research base in Antarctica.
This marked a major milestone of China's 40th Antarctic expedition team, with the completion of an aerial scientific survey of ice sheet margins of the Queen Maud Land and the Enderby Land, a major international polar cooperation project.
The Antarctic ice sheet, a vast expanse of ice covering the continent, is experiencing mass loss due to global warming, creating uncertainty in predicting future sea level rise.
To calculate the mass loss, the key lies in gathering two critical statistics: the speed of ice movement and ice thickness at the margins of the ice sheet. The most effective way to obtain ice thickness is through aerial surveys using the airborne ""ice radar.""

In 2021, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) established the RINGS Action Group (hereafter referred to as ""the RINGS"") to collect data on ice thickness and sub-ice terrain along the margins of the Antarctic ice sheet through international cooperative aerial observations. So far, 82 scientists from 18 countries have joined the RINGS.
In 2023, the RINGS launched its first international collaborative program for aerial scientific exploration in the data-deficient regions of the Queen Maud Land and the Enderby Land. China was a major initiator of the program.
""The complex meteorological conditions at the margins of the Antarctic ice sheet posed a major challenge for the aerial survey. Besides, it involved extensive international communication and coordination across all aspects,"" said Cui Xiangbin, a researcher with the Center for Polar Ice & Snow and Climate Change Research in the Polar Research Institute of China under the Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources.
According to Cui, with a surveyed length of 7,200 kilometers and a total flight time of around 28 hours, the program successfully mitigated data shortages.
Following the completion of the program, China would share the observation data collected by Snow Eagle 601 with other countries and collaborate on joint research projects, so as to provide valuable information for scientists around the world to study the rapid changes of the Antarctic ice sheet and the rise in global sea levels.
Kenichi Matsuoka, chair of the RINGS and professor with the Norwegian Polar Institute, has expressed his appreciation to China's 40th Antarctic expedition team for their valuable contributions in a recent email.

Besides, the Chinese team has carried out multiple international cooperation projects during the 40th Antarctic expedition.
At the end of December 2023, Zhang Nan, a member of China's 40th Antarctic expedition team and professor with the College of Construction Engineering, Jilin University, obtained ice core samples with his team by the side of the Dålk Glacier in the Larsemann Hills in southeast Antarctica, about 25 kilometers away from China's Zhongshan Station. Besides, they have drilled a 48-centimeter-long sample of subglacial bedrock. This marked an important breakthrough in Antarctic geological studies.
This breakthrough was jointly achieved by China's Jilin University, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, and the All-Russia Scientific Research Institute for Geology and Mineral Resources of the Ocean.
""For more than two months, Chinese and Russian scientists worked hand in hand and fostered a profound friendship,"" Zhang told People's Daily.
According to Zhang, the successful retrieval of the subglacial bedrock sample marked the world's first targeted geological survey and sampling of subglacial bedrock within the deep Antarctic ice sheet. In this process, Chinese and foreign researchers exchanged experience, learned from each other, and engaged in in-depth discussions on technical issues, he added.
On February 7 this year, China's Qinling Station in Antarctica, the country's fifth research station in the continent, started operation on Inexpressible Island in the Ross Sea.
As planned, the Qinling Station will collaborate with research stations from other countries, transform its marine laboratory into an international cooperation platform, and set a model of international cooperation in Antarctic research along the coast of the Ross Sea.
The polar scientific expedition holds immense importance and is a noble endeavor benefiting humanity. Ever since initiating polar exploration 40 years ago, China has been actively involved in almost all major international observation and research programs in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. It has also actively sent personnel to participate in Antarctic expeditions in other countries, while gradually expanding its international cooperation in the Arctic.
Chinese polar expedition members in Antarctica have always lived in harmony with their international counterparts, and have offered emergency international rescue assistance in times of need.
