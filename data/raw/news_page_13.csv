Researchers propose massive water production method on Moon
 (Xinhua) 08:15, August 23, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a new method of massive water production through the reaction between lunar regolith and endogenous hydrogen. Their study was published in the journal The Innovation on Thursday.
The study of the Moon's water content plays a vital role in the construction of future scientific research bases and human survival.
Research results from previous lunar explorations have revealed that ice may exist in a natural state at the moon's north and south poles and in its permanently shadowed regions.
However, the natural water content in lunar minerals is extremely low, ranging from 0.0001 percent to 0.02 percent, according to the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). It remains challenging to extract and utilize water in situ on the moon.
Recently, researchers from the NIMTE, Institute of Physics of the CAS, China Academy of Space Technology, Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, Nanjing University and Harbin Institute of Technology used lunar regolith samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission to conduct related studies on various lunar minerals.
They found that the solar wind has irradiated the minerals in lunar soil for billions of years and stored abundant hydrogen. When heated to high temperatures, the hydrogen reacts with the iron oxides in the minerals to form elemental iron and large amounts of water.
When the temperature rises above 1,000 degrees Celsius, the lunar soil melts, and the water generated by this reaction is released as vapor.
The researchers confirmed that 1 g of molten lunar regolith can generate 51-76 mg of water. ""In other words, 1 tonne of lunar regolith can produce more than 50 kg of water, which can meet the daily drinking water needs of 50 people per day,"" said Wang Junqiang, a professor at the NIMTE.
Besides, the researchers further investigated the differences in hydrogen content in different lunar minerals. The lunar ilmenite FeTiO3 was found to contain the highest amount of solar wind-implanted hydrogen among the five primary minerals, including ilmenite, plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene and lunar glass, in the lunar regolith.
The in situ heating experiments indicated that the hydrogen retained in lunar minerals is a substantial resource for producing water on the moon.
The researchers studied the atomic structure of lunar ilmenite in detail. They discovered that compared with ilmenite on Earth, the atomic spacing in lunar soil increased significantly due to the presence of hydrogen.
The simulation results showed that there are sub-nano tunnels in ilmenite in lunar soil, which can absorb and store many hydrogen atoms from the solar wind.
The experiment also found that the formation temperature of water can be reduced from 800 degrees Celsius to 200 degrees Celsius.
This result can explain the variation in the distribution of hydrogen on the moon with latitude differences. The equatorial position of the moon is the most irradiated by the solar wind, which contains a lot of electrons. Thus, more hydrogen is restored to water vapor and volatilized, while high latitudes are less affected by solar wind electron irradiation and can retain more hydrogen.
These discoveries provide pioneering insights into the water exploration on the moon, according to the NIMTE.
The Chang'e-5 probe, which returned to Earth on Dec. 17, 2020, retrieved 1,731 grams of lunar samples, consisting primarily of rocks and soil from the lunar surface.

Chinese, foreign physicists make new discovery in antimatter
 (Xinhua) 14:30, August 22, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- A joint research team made up of Chinese and foreign physicists has observed a new antimatter hypernucleus, by using a heavy ion collider in the United States, marking an important step forward in the exploration of antimatter.
The discovery of anti-hyperhydrogen-4, which is the heaviest antimatter hypernucleus observed in experiments to date, was made by a research team led by the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The study was published in the latest issue of the academic journal Nature.
Current physics assumes that the properties of matter and antimatter are symmetrical and that equal amounts of matter and antimatter existed at the birth of the universe. Fortunately, some mysterious physical mechanism led to a slight asymmetry in the early universe. After the annihilation of most matter and antimatter, approximately one in ten billion matter particles survived, which formed the matter world we see today, scientists explained.
""What caused the difference in quantities of matter and antimatter in the universe? To answer this question, an important approach is to create new antimatter in the laboratory and study its properties,"" said Qiu Hao, a researcher from IMP.
In today's matter-dominated world, antimatter is extremely rare because it easily annihilates with surrounding matter. Antimatter nuclei and antimatter hypernuclei are even more difficult to produce. Since scientists predicted the existence of antimatter in 1928, only six types of antimatter (hyper) nuclei have been discovered, Qiu said.
The newly discovered anti-hyperhydrogen-4 was produced at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the United States. RHIC can accelerate heavy ion beams to nearly the speed of light and make them collide.
These collisions simulate the conditions of the early universe in the laboratory, producing fireballs with temperatures of several trillion degrees, which contain approximately equal amounts of matter and antimatter. As the fireball rapidly expands and cools, some antimatter escapes annihilation with matter and is detected by a detector named STAR.
""After analyzing experimental data of approximately 6.6 billion heavy-ion collision events, we reconstructed anti-hyperhydrogen-4 from its decay products,"" said Wu Junlin, a PhD student at IMP.
The researchers also measured the lifetime of anti-hyperhydrogen-4, and found no significant difference from that of its corresponding particle hyperhydrogen-4 within the measurement precision, further verifying the symmetry between matter and antimatter properties.

An AS700 civil manned airship arrives in Guilin, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Aug. 21, 2024. China's independently-developed AS700 civil manned airship on Wednesday completed its first trans-provincial ferry flight, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). (AVIC/Handout via Xinhua)
China's homegrown civil airship, the AS700 ""Xiangyun"", achieved a historical milestone on Wednesday by completing its first successful inter-provincial flight across 1,000 kilometers, signifying the longest and farthest journey ever undertaken by a home-made manned airship, said its developer, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).
This landmark journey traversed Central China's Hubei and Hunan provinces, and reached Guilin city in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, marking the airship's maiden cross-provincial long-distance voyage, according to a statement from AVIC sent to the Global Times on Wednesday.
The AS700 completed the flight in 12 hours and 44 minutes. The impressive performance showed the airship's potential for long-haul travel and extended endurance, paving the way for its future commercial use.
The first unit of the airship is scheduled for delivery this year, with all preparations for commercial operations expected to be in place by the yearend, said the development team, adding that potential applications include low-altitude logistics, aerial surveying, emergency rescue, and urban security.
The AS700 has a maximum takeoff weight of over 4,150 kg, a range of 700 kilometers, and can carry up to 10 passengers. It is designed to be low-carbon and cost-effective, according to the statement.
""The breakthrough in AS700's lightweight, cost-effective design has reduced the airship's weight while cutting production cost by 30 percent, significantly boosting its market competitiveness,"" the development team told the Global Times on Wednesday.
AVIC also revealed that the team is working to expedite the commercial operation of airships through pilot and maintenance personnel training, as well as establishing operational regulations to ensure the airship's successful delivery.
This flight followed the airship's earlier maiden flight between two airports within Hubei province on March 30, highlighting China's growing capability in airship technology amid the country's ongoing pursuit to develop the low-altitude economy.
The research team tested the airship's comprehensive performance during Wednesday's flight, such as endurance and long-haul flight capability. They are also planning to assess the airship's passenger comfort, which will be crucial in shaping its future commercial operations.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China granted an airship-type certificate to the AS700 in late 2023.
As China continues to innovate in the low-altitude economy, the AS700, with its green, low-carbon technology and versatile usage, is set to become a pivotal player in the evolving landscape of air transportation and tourism, industry insiders said.
""Future applications could range from scenic tours and family visits to unique 'cloud weddings,' bringing new dimensions to aerial experiences,"" the developer said.

In Hefei, east China’s Anhui Province, at the Chinese new energy vehicle company NIO’s Second Advanced Manufacturing Base, a 1.7-meter-tall robot steps towards the production line with small strides. Trained to perform tasks, it methodically completes quality inspections on door locks, taillight covers, and seat belts, finally affixing the car logo with delicate precision.
This marks the world’s first instance of a humanoid robot collaborating with humans on a car assembly line, performing both assembly and quality inspection. In the highly repetitive environment of an automotive production line, robots are introducing new possibilities.
A thousand kilometers away is the place making the greatest strides in humanoid robotics, the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, or Beijing E-Town, in suburban Beijing’s Yizhuang. It has emerged as an innovation hub for the humanoid robot industry, with the size of the sector accounting for over 50 percent of the capital city’s total.
Beijing E-Town has been strategically planning its humanoid robot industry since 2022, according to a staff member of its robot and intelligent manufacturing industry bureau. In a relatively short period of time, it has attracted over 100 companies related to humanoid robots.
The Zhongguancun (Yizhuang) International Robot Industrial Park, covering an area of 250,000 square meters, has become the center of their efforts. It is home to industrial giant UBTECH as well as Beijing Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robotics Innovation Center, or HUMANOID.
At HUMANOID, a humanoid robot called Tien Kung can follow the instructions of staff members. On April 27, 2024, the center revealed its independently developed general-purpose humanoid robot as a technological research platform.
When Tien Kung made its debut, it achieved the world’s first instance of an anthropomorphic full-size fully electric-driven intelligent robot running, as the robot sprinted onto the stage.
“This reflected the technological strength of our team,” said Li Chunzhi, deputy general manager of the center.
Measuring 1.63 meters in height and 56 kilograms in weight, Tien Kung showcases an impressive array of capabilities including climbing stairs and navigating obstacles. It has already demonstrated high-level embodied intelligence capabilities, including visual recognition, voice interaction, and unstructured object handling.
The center was established by industrial leaders like UBTECH, Beijing Jingcheng Machinery Electric Holding Co., Ltd. (Jingcheng Machinery Electric), and Beijing E-Town Robot Technology Industry Development Co., Ltd. in November 2023. It aims to build itself into a globally influential source of innovation in embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) and a demonstration zone for Embodied AI.
The center has attracted top global scientists and engineers in embodied AI robotics, with research personnel accounting for over 70 percent of its total staff members. According to Li, three of the four heads of the center’s technical department are PhDs who returned from renowned overseas universities and have extensive experience in related fields.

UBTECH on its own has also developed a series of increasingly advanced humanoid robots since 2012. Its industrial humanoid robot Walker S, introduced in 2023, is the model working in NIO’s Hefei manufacturing plant.
The company’s dedication to innovation is evident in its impressive patent portfolio. By the end of 2023, UBTECH had secured over 2,100 patents related to robotics and artificial intelligence, including more than 400 overseas patents, over 50 percent of which were invention patents, according to Jiao Jichao, vice president of UBTECH. The company has more valid humanoid robot patents than anyone else in the world.
Although Beijing E-Town houses over 100 companies related to humanoid robots, it aims to attract more upstream and downstream enterprises in the sector.
Founded in 2015, Beijing Chietom Precision Transmission Technology Co., Ltd. (Chietom) is a company that specializes in developing and manufacturing rotate vector (RV) reducers, essential components applied in industrial robot joints. It has emerged as a leader in the field of high-precision transmission technology for robots.
Zhang Yueming, chief scientist of Chietom, said the company started research on reducers for humanoid robots in 2019. Zhang, also a renowned expert in robot reducers and a professor at Beijing University of Technology, led his team as they achieved scientific breakthroughs on the core technologies of RV reducers. Today, Chietom can produce 200,000 reducers annually, addressing a crucial technological bottleneck in the industry.

The practical applications of humanoid robots are already being explored in various industries.
In early 2024, UBTECH’s industrial humanoid robots, Walker S, began “training” at the assembly workshop of NIO’s Second Advanced Manufacturing Base in Hefei. Subsequently, other automotive companies, including Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor Co., Ltd., FAW-VW Automotive Co. Ltd. Qingdao Branch, and Geely Auto, cooperated with UBTECH for the wide application of humanoid robots in industrial scenarios to build intelligent and flexible production lines and unmanned car factories.
According to Jiao, since the beginning of this year, the research and development (R&D) team at UBTECH has surveyed the needs of over 10 intelligent manufacturing enterprises in automobile, computer, communication and consumer electronic industries regarding robotic products.
He added that they have been involved in an in-depth discussion on the application of humanoid robots on auto production lines, mainly discussing the feasibility of applying humanoid robots in various aspects of auto manufacturing, including handling, sorting, assembling, and testing of auto parts.
Li suggested exploring the application scenarios of humanoid robots driven by demands in various industries. Li added that research institutions and robot-related enterprises can rely on the Tien Kung platform to explore applications of humanoid robots in intelligent manufacturing, hazardous operations, special work, business services, home care, and other areas according to market demands.c
Li noted that Beijing Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robotics Innovation Center has collaborated with the research center for intelligent robotics under the Tsinghua University Institute for Artificial Intelligence, the Lab for Affective and Cognitive Intelligent Robotics of Peking University, and the team of Guo Shijie, a professor from Hebei University of Technology for the development of humanoid robots.
In 2023, a three-year action plan was introduced to promote the high-quality development of the robot industry in Beijing E-Town. The plan set ambitious targets by 2025, including a compound annual growth rate of more than 50 percent in robot R&D investment, cultivating leading enterprises, setting up 50 demonstration projects for robot applications, achieving a robot density of 365 units per 10,000 workers in industrial enterprises above designated size, and making the robot industry achieve a total production value of 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion).

Kinetica-2, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Space's new liquid propellant rocket that is designed to support China's large-scale satellite constellation networks, has successfully completed its stage separation test, marking a milestone achievement toward its maiden flight scheduled for 2025, the Global Times learned from the rocket developer on Tuesday.
According to CAS Space, the test demonstrated the normal functioning of all systems involved and confirmed the successful separation of the rocket's first and second stages.
The test validated the correctness and compatibility of the secondary unlocking scheme for stage separation. It also confirmed the effective performance of related components during the separation process, including unlocking devices, energy separation, gas line disconnection, cable disconnection, and shock absorption mechanisms.
Independently developed by CAS Space, the Kinetica-2 is a medium-sized liquid carrier rocket designed with a focus on standardization, serialization, and modularization. It is engineered to meet the future demands of large-scale satellite constellation networks and low-cost cargo transportation.
The rocket features a Common Booster Core (CBC) configuration, a core stage diameter of 3.35 meters, a total length of 53 meters, a liftoff weight of 625 tons, and a liftoff thrust of 766 tons.
With a payload capacity of 8 tons to Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) and 12 tons to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the rocket is capable of launching into Sun-synchronous, low-Earth, and transfer orbits. This capability will further enhance China's ability to conduct large-scale, low-cost space missions and propel the nation's commercial space industry advancement.
Currently, the Kinetica-2's service targets include low-cost cargo spacecraft, the second-generation carbon emission monitoring satellite, the Qianfan mega-constellation project, or known as the G60, and other large internet constellations, Zhang Yanrui, technology director of the CAS Space, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
The model is now in the large-scale ground testing phase of its engineering development, with its maiden flight scheduled for 2025.
Future work will involve the development and validation of general core stage bundled load transfer technology, large-diameter fairing separation ground test technology, and axial compression testing design and verification for barrel structures, Zhang disclosed.

China has ramped up efforts to accelerate scientific research and innovation lately. Aided by state-of-the-art research facilities, a vast and skilled group of young and experienced researchers, as well as strong institutional support, China is now on a par with some leading developed countries in science and technology innovation, a prominent Chinese scientist said.
Surrounded by a huge reservoir and lush vegetation, an islet in Hefei, the provincial capital city of East China's Anhui Province, is an epitome of the cutting-edge research and new tech innovation that supports China's incessant breakthroughs in technological advancement.
The islet, also known as the Science Island, is home to the Steady High Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) at the High Magnetic Field Laboratory, the Hefei Institute of Physical Science, a research institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Global Times reporters visited this research center on the island where Chinese scientists successfully produced a steady magnetic field of 452,200 gauss, or 45.22 tesla, surpassing the previous world record set by the US (450,000 gauss) nearly 23 years ago. Generally speaking, a higher magnetic field increases the potential for new discoveries.
This success marks a significant milestone in the advancement of magnetic technology both in China and globally. The achievement marks the creation of the highest steady magnetic field, one that's over 900,000 times more powerful than the Earth's, by leveraging a hybrid magnet approach.
The SHMFF strongly supports frontier scientific explorations, including physics, material science, chemistry, and life science. The landmark achievement, announced in August 2022, was made by talented engineers and scientists at one of the world's top magnet laboratories
""The breakthrough demonstrates China's capability to provide robust support for scientific exploration of the physical world by generating powerful steady magnetic fields,"" said Kuang Guangli, the laboratory's director.
Currently, there are five major laboratories dedicated to steady high magnetic fields located within the US, France, the Netherlands, Japan, and China. These major scientific facilities create extreme experimental conditions essential for the study of physical science and contribute significantly to major scientific discoveries, Kuang noted.
The SHMFF began operations in 2017 and has operated more than 600,000 machine hours now, providing over 200 scientific and educational institutions at home and abroad with the experimental conditions for cutting-edge research in multiple disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and new materials.
Distinct research facilities
""Our facilities have reached the highest level in the world,"" said Kuang, adding that China has already caught up with or even surpassed some developed countries in terms of research facilities thanks to sustained high-level input over the past decade.
Describing their success, Kuang told the Global Times that China's scientific community is on the cusp of a significant breakthrough, with research environment quickly reaching international standards. China's scientific accomplishments are poised to make a significant impact in the world, he said.
""The explosive emergence of China's scientific research achievements is not surprising,"" Kuang said. Hefei has now become a microcosm of China's scientific progress.
After years of investment, China's research levels have reached an internationally advanced level. In terms of scientific equipment and environment, there is not much difference compared with those in Europe and the US, he said.
According to Kuang, large-scale scientific facilities are crucial for achieving groundbreaking results and maintaining a competitive edge in science and technology.
""Without large scientific facilities, scientific research would be just an idea on paper."" Kuang believes that generating increasingly stronger steady-state magnetic field strengths will advance scientific understanding of the electric and magnetic properties of materials, allowing scientists to make new discoveries in physics.
China has made notable achievements in the construction of large-scale scientific facilities after decades of development. If all projects flagged in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) are completed, China will have approximately 70 large scientific research facilities, a number comparable to that of the US, said Wang Yifang, director of the Institute of High Energy Physics of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Kuang compared large scientific facilities to boosters for research, noting that ""they provide the necessary material and technological foundation for scientific research, accelerate the process of new technological innovation, and the research results can also be transformed into practical applications, and promote the development of high-tech industries.""
Amid fierce international competition, Kuang said that China is becoming increasingly resilient and motivated in addressing key challenges in science and technology, adding that China's focus on frontier research and the hard-working spirit of the Chinese people will help drive technological development.
To boost China's strength in strategic science and technology, China will refine the system of national laboratories and better define the roles and layout of national research institutions, research-oriented universities, and leading high-tech enterprises, according to a resolution adopted by the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization.

Low-elevation glaciers on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau may vanish permanently: scientists,2024-08-20,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0820/c90000-20207970.html,"Home>>
		
Low-elevation glaciers on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau may vanish permanently: scientists
 (Xinhua) 14:37, August 20, 2024
LHASA, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- In August 2019, Iceland held a memorial event for a glacier lost to climate change, and now Chinese scientists are sounding the alarm that some low-elevation glaciers on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau may disappear permanently, which could significantly impact the plateau's ecosystem.
By the end of the 21st century, the loss of glacial mass in some regions of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau will exceed 50 percent, according to model predictions.
Over the past five decades, the plateau has witnessed rapid warming, with a temperature increase of about 0.4 degrees Celsius every 10 years, more than double the global average warming rate during the same period.
""Taking the Rongbuk Glacier at the foot of Mount Qomolangma as an example, the length and height of it are both shrinking,"" said Wu Guangjian, a researcher at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
Wu added that global warming has caused the rate of glacier evaporation to exceed precipitation, and small glaciers at lower elevations on the plateau are melting more rapidly and are likely to disappear in the future.
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is the region with the most glaciers outside the polar regions. Data shows that the glaciers on the plateau holds over 8 trillion cubic meters of water, providing essential water resources for more than 2 billion people downstream.
""The model shows that lake water levels in some areas of the plateau might rise by over 10 meters at the end of the century, which could enhance the plateau's overall water supply capacity,"" said Yao Tandong, an academician at the CAS and the leader of China's ongoing second scientific expedition and research project on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau.
""However, it also increases the risk of glacier collapses and glacial lake outburst floods,"" Yao added.
In this project, Chinese scientists have used high-precision radar for the first time to obtain a continuous profile of snow and ice thickness at the summit of Mount Qomolangma, as well as accurate measurements of its ice and snow depth.
In addition, the construction of the hydrometeorological observation system was successfully completed at the exit of the Dasuopu Glacier basin at 5,000 meters and at the glacier pass at 7,000 meters on Mount Shishapangma. Ice core samples were also extracted from the Dasuopu Glacier, providing key data on the impact of glacier retreat on hydrological processes.
Wu said that the world needs to reach a consensus on addressing climate warming and take action as soon as possible.
""Otherwise, we will witness the disappearance of glaciers in more regions across the globe,"" Wu added.

BEIJING, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- A major progress has been made in the construction of the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), the first high-energy synchrotron radiation light source in China, with the electron beams with currents reaching 12 mA stored in the HEPS storage ring.
The Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the main HEPS developer, announced the new achievement in Beijing's suburban Huairou District on Monday.
As one of the country's key scientific and technological infrastructure projects, HEPS is expected to become one of the brightest fourth-generation synchrotron radiation facilities worldwide and will serve as a research platform for material science, chemical engineering, biomedicine and other fields.
The construction of the HEPS project began on June 29, 2019. The facility is composed of several parts, including accelerators, beamlines, end stations and support facilities.
A synchrotron radiation light source is a source of electromagnetic radiation usually produced by a storage ring. To generate extremely bright light, electrons will be accelerated to near the speed of light in several stages and forced to travel in a closed path.
The electron storage ring, with a circumference of 1,360.4 meters, is the main component of the HEPS accelerator complex. The HEPS storage ring is one of the largest synchrotron light source accelerators in the world and the largest in China. Its primary function is to store high-energy, high-quality electron beams and generate high-performance synchrotron radiation, according to Pan Weimin, the HEPS project director.
The commissioning of the storage ring was launched on July 23. A total of 1,776 magnets, over 2,500 power supplies and 578 electron beam position monitors have been installed on the storage ring, with over 100,000 control signals.
""Any small hardware error could affect the trajectory of the electron beam, which is undoubtedly a huge challenge for the commissioning of the storage ring,"" said Pan.
Commissioning of the HEPS storage ring will continue in the next few months, with the aim of achieving higher beam currents with a sufficiently long beam lifetime for vacuum conditioning and beamline commissioning, said Jiao Yi, deputy head of the HEPS accelerator division.
The HEPS project is expected to be ready for operation by the end of 2025. Once completed, HEPS will be able to emit light that is one trillion times brighter than the sun, and will be open to users in fields such as aerospace, energy, environment, life science and pharmaceuticals, according to IHEP.

Technologies, smart system facilitate flood prevention in China
 (People's Daily Online) 10:11, August 19, 2024
This year, China has experienced frequent heavy rainfall over extended periods, with river floods occurring early and developing rapidly, making the flood control situation severe and complex.
In response, regions across the country have strengthened their technological defenses by accelerating the construction of a “smart flood control” system, providing solid technological support for modern flood prevention.

One key part of a “smart flood control” system is prediction, and one program is making huge progress on that front through the use of “simulated” floods.
The Dateng Gorge Water Conservancy project in Guiping city, south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, serves as a key flood control hub for the Pearl River basin.
Affected by heavy rainfall, four floods occurred in the Xijiang River in the Pearl River basin from late June to early July, putting pressure on the Dateng Gorge Water Conservancy project.
At the dispatch center of the project, water management engineer Li Ying stared at a monitoring screen. “The digital twin system for water resources management has played a crucial role in this year’s flood prevention efforts,” Li said.
The digital twin system uses technologies like big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence to create a virtual version of rivers, lakes, and water conservancy projects in the digital world, which can predict the development of possible floods and support precise decision-making.
The digital twin system has the capability to make forecasts, issue early warnings, conduct simulations and draft contingency plans, Li noted.
“We managed to forecast floods 10 days in advance and accurately predicted water level increases 48 hours ahead for four floods in the mainstream of the Xijiang River during this year’s flood season,” Li added.
The Dateng Gorge Water Conservancy project epitomizes China’s constant efforts to accelerate the development of the digital twin system for water resources management in recent years. Digital twin platforms have been built for the seven major rivers, including the Yangtze, Yellow, and Huaihe, in an accelerated manner, providing effective support for flood control and management.
Another important tool seeing increased use for flood prevention are drones. They are becoming key on the frontline of flood control and for emergency response teams due to their efficiency, flexibility, and precision.
On July 18, a drone flew at a steady speed above the Suokou Reservoir in Jiuzhi township, Hejiang county, southwest China’s Sichuan Province. It collected oblique photography data of the reservoir, which was used to create VR panoramas of risk points for flood control and disaster mitigation, as well as 3D modeling.
On July 28, a breach occurred in the Sixin dike in Yisuhe township, Xiangtan city, central China’s Hunan Province. At the rescue site, a staff member operated a drone to collect 360-degree panoramic images of the breach area, providing crucial data support for the subsequent efforts to seal the breach.
These drones allow flood prevention workers to reach and see areas that were impossible before, allowing for much more complete and precise information in their battle against floods.
In addition to focusing on tools to monitor and manage floods, there is a major effort to better monitor precipitation.
Since last year, regions across China have accelerated the deployment of precipitation measurement radars in areas prone to rainstorms and floods in key river basins, major water conservancy projects, and areas prone to disasters from mountain torrents. These radars ensure precise monitoring and forecasting of rainfall and water conditions.
Compared to the traditional flood forecasting system, precipitation measurement radars can extend the flood forecast period, according to Wang Lin, chief hydrological forecaster with the Ministry of Water Resources.
Since the start of this year’s flood season, Hunan Province has successfully predicted water level changes in small and medium-sized rivers, including the Jinjing River and Guitang River, according to precipitation forecasts based on precipitation measurement radars, providing departments of water resources with crucial information for decision-making.
Going forward, the Ministry of Water Resources will focus on promoting the deployment of precipitation measurement radars in small and medium-sized rivers and areas prone to rainstorms and floods to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts, Wang said.

Qinghai-Xizang Plateau a vital carbon sink: scientific research,2024-08-19,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0819/c90000-20207373.html,"Home>>
		
Qinghai-Xizang Plateau a vital carbon sink: scientific research
 (Xinhua) 10:10, August 19, 2024
LHASA, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem absorbs approximately 120 to 140 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, accounting for 10 to 16 percent of China's total ecosystem carbon sink, according to the findings of the second Qinghai-Xizang Plateau scientific expedition and research released on Sunday.
Given that the plateau currently emits 55 million tonnes of CO2 annually, its carbon surplus exceeds more than 65 million tonnes per year, said Yao Tandong, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and leader of this scientific research survey, at a press conference in Lhasa.
Yao added that the plateau's 1.4 million square km of permafrost holds around 37 billion tonnes of organic carbon, accounting for over 60 percent of the plateau's total soil carbon stock.
""However, the potential thawing of deep permafrost due to future climate warming could pose a risk to its carbon sequestration capacity,"" Yao said.
The Global Observation-based System for Monitoring Greenhouse Gas (GONGGA) system, developed independently by the scientific research survey team, is an essential tool for estimating natural carbon sinks.
It integrates atmospheric transport modeling, CO2 concentration observations, and CO2 emission inventories to accurately assess the carbon sink capacity of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem.
This system not only supports China's ""dual carbon"" goals with important scientific data but also provides valuable Chinese data and methodologies for international carbon accounting and assessments.
""Going forward, the carbon sink function of the plateau can be enhanced further by improving the quality of grassland and forest ecosystems,"" Yao said.
China initiated the second scientific expedition and research of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau in August 2017, intending to reveal the mechanism of environmental change and provide scientific support for the ecological security of the plateau.

Rocket technology-powered device saves patients with heart failure
 (Xinhua) 09:48, August 19, 2024
TIANJING, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Haining was once on the brink of death from severe heart disease, but 1,174 days ago, he was given a new lease of life.
The 25-year-old patient from the city of Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, underwent surgery three years ago to implant an artificial heart in place of his failed organ. The surgery was a success, and his condition has now massively improved, allowing him to live a normal life with the aid of the medical device, which is powered by aerospace technology.
Called HeartCon, the artificial heart was jointly developed by Tianjin-based TEDA International Cardiovascular Hospital and the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the country's leading rocket maker.
It functions as a pump delivering blood to the whole body, significantly alleviating the symptoms of heart failure. Engineers of the HeartCon project said the device works like a rocket's servomechanism, driven by a hydraulic pump.
In 2022, the device gained market approval and has now saved over 190 patients in advanced stages of heart failure, like Li.
These patients wear a small controller, similar in size to a mobile phone, on their waist. The machine records various data such as the speed, flow, power and heart rate of the blood pump. A thin wire connects to the battery which continuously assists in pumping blood to organs throughout the body.
Li used to suffer from cold sweats and struggle with breathing difficulties. He waited anxiously for a heart transplant, but there was a lack of donors.
""I was prepared for the worst,"" he said, recalling the days before his implant surgery in May 2021.
There are at least 16 million people in China suffering from heart failure. However, the scarcity of donors and effective medications poses limitations on human organ transplants. Fortunately, the development of artificial hearts has emerged as a promising solution to extend the lives of these patients, said Liu Xiaocheng, head of the TEDA hospital.
The symptoms of Li's heart condition have now significantly improved. Since being discharged from the hospital, Li has gained 12 kg in weight, found a girlfriend, and is now able to support himself financially. Some patients have experienced even better recovery and successfully had their artificial hearts removed.
The domestically-made artificial heart device is cheaper than imported products. According to its developers, the ""HeartCon II"", with a smaller and lighter passive magnetic suspension design, is currently being tested.
""We will continue the collaboration between medicine and engineering to save more lives,"" Liu said.

Race for AI talent heats up amid demand,2024-08-19,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0819/c90000-20207118.html,"Home>>
		
Race for AI talent heats up amid demand
By Cheng Si (China Daily) 08:26, August 19, 2024

Contestants participate in the China Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Competition in Hefei, Anhui province, on Sunday. ZHANG MIN/FOR CHINA DAILY
Chinese employers are in a tight race and offering fat salaries as they scramble for talent with artificial intelligence knowledge or learning background, hoping to gain the advantage for future business expansion.
The recruitment portal Liepin recently released a report showing that the numbers of job openings and job seekers surged in the sector of AI-generated content, or AIGC, in the first quarter of the year. Specifically, AIGC-related job openings soared 321.7 percent year-on-year during the quarter, and the number of job seekers rose nearly 947 percent.
With the hiring race heating up, the recruiting salary offered by employers also shot upward. Liepin said in the report that the average annual salary for AIGC-related jobs was about 408,700 yuan ($57,045), with most of the jobs offering above 500,000 yuan per year.
Larger cities and those with internet titans — including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen in Guangdong province and Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, where big tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance are located — offer most AI-related job opportunities.
ByteDance, for example, launched a recruitment campaign in late May to attract graduates with doctoral degrees, after it ramped up efforts to compete in the AI universe. The campaign, named Top Seed, is aimed at grads with PhDs who are interested in machine learning, AI, large language models and audio and video generation, and the company says it offers high salaries, although it didn't disclose exact figures.
In a reflection of the tight global race to attract AI talent, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in April on the social platform X that his company was increasing salaries and compensation for staff members on Tesla's AI engineering team, after OpenAI, an AI research organization in the United States, attempted to lure away employees on his team.
Pang Shi, director of the Chinese Academy of Personnel Science's department of employment and entrepreneurship, said: ""The increasing AI-related job openings and the market's demand for talent of this kind are a result of technology advancement and industrial development. The market's demand for AI talent will keep growing in the next few years, allowing for companies' continuous investment and the government's support policies in the sector.
""AI's extensive use in diversified sectors such as healthcare, finance and transportation will also drive employers' hiring for a workforce of this kind,"" Pang said, adding that the hiring spree for AI talent is not just a fad, but will be a regular pursuit in the future.
Zhang Yuejia, president of Zhaopin, another recruitment portal, said that around 2020, the need for AI talent began to emerge, and the need surged after ChatGPT, a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI, hit the market in 2022.
""For example, job openings on our platform concerning large language model development skyrocketed 605 percent in the first half of the year, compared with that in 2023,"" he said.
""Also, job openings on natural language processing — one of the core vacancies in AI — surged 126 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, and the average monthly salary offered for the job was up 12 percent year-on-year,"" Zhang added.
However, AI-related jobs have higher standards for people's educational background and work experience, with versatile and highly skilled candidates preferred by employers. In addition, cutting-edge AI technology has brought about new job opportunities as well as challenges.
Global consultancy McKinsey &Co projected last year that China's need for AI-related workers would grow by 2030 from 1 million to 6 million. However, local and overseas universities, as well as existing top-tier talent, could only provide one-third of the necessary talent, leaving a shortage of about 4 million.
""A worker or job seeker is required not only to have broader knowledge and a good understanding of the AI industry and innovation for commercial transition, but also strong abilities in team working, coordinating and problem solving, and advanced ideas of AI's influence on ethics, laws and social development to ensure that the technology is used legally and responsibly,"" Zhang said.
He added that employers' increasing efforts to develop AI-related jobs and attract talent are a result of technology advancement and companies' need for transformation.
""A workforce proficient in AI technology is becoming the key resource in business competition, as the trailblazing technology has great potential in improving productivity, optimizing work procedures and innovating new products and services, which will be a strong booster for the enterprises to expand their business landscape,"" he said.
Pang, the researcher, suggested that young people adapt to the recruitment trend by closely following the AI industry's developments and updating their knowledge and skills.
""It's better to gain AI-related certificates or official recognition and make themselves into a many-sided person with interdisciplinary knowledge of AI and healthcare, as well as, finance and education,"" she added.
