Researchers unravel plants' ""cry for help"" response in fighting disease
 (Xinhua) 13:09, March 23, 2024
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently revealed how plants assemble rhizosphere microbiomes through a ""cry for help"" mechanism to defend themselves from pathogen invasion, according to a report carried on Science and Technology Daily.
The discovery, made by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, was published in the Nature Communications journal.
Researchers used a series of modified nonpathogenic bacteria to simulate pathogen attacks. They found that these ""mild"" bacteria can trigger a ""cry for help"" response, leading plants to assemble multiple microbiomes around the narrow zone between their roots and the soil. The effect can even last for several planting cycles, providing long-lasting protection for plants, Science and Technology Daily reported on Friday.
They also found that when a plant sends out a ""cry for help"" signal, a microorganism known as Devosia can respond quickly and multiply in the plant's rhizosphere to defend it from pathogens.
A polypeptide component of Devosia can trigger further response and strengthen the interaction between plants and microorganisms. This interaction could be of great significance to the growth and health of plants.

Construction of China's smart customs enters phase of comprehensive implementation,2024-03-22,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0322/c90000-20148302.html,"Home>>
		
Construction of China's smart customs enters phase of comprehensive implementation
By Wang Junling (People's Daily) 15:02, March 22, 2024
As the customs of the world's largest trading nation in goods, the Customs of China inspects the largest volume of goods each year, with the most diverse scenarios and most comprehensive modes.
The construction of China's smart customs has entered a phase of comprehensive implementation this year, and the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) will build nine landmark projects to make customs supervision services more intelligent and automated, said an official with the GACC at a regular press briefing recently.

The Shanghai Customs for the first time launched inspection for exhibition halls and exhibits with new technologies such as augmented reality (AR) goggles and digital tags during the fourth China International Import Expo in 2021. Photo shows a customs officer checking the information of a milk powder product with AR goggles. (Photo from the official account of the publicity department of the Pudong New Area of Shanghai on WeChat)
In recent years, the rapid development of new technologies such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things has provided new ways and means for customs supervision services, offering strong technological support.
""We will continue to strengthen and explore the application of technological innovation in different customs scenarios,"" said Chen Zongwang, deputy head of the Department of Science and Technology of the GACC, adding that the construction of smart customs will fully leverage the guiding and supporting role of technological innovation.
For example, through intelligent image recognition, various goods can be identified, which will enable a 24/7 working mode, reduce frontline pressure, and enhance port targeted supervision capabilities.
Additionally, intelligent trademark recognition technology for intellectual property rights can quickly search trademark information in the intellectual property rights filing system online, thus identifying infringing trademarks.
In recent years, the GACC has been continuously promoting digital transformation and intelligent upgrading, optimizing regulatory services and supporting the construction of the international logistics system.

Du Hongwei, deputy head of the Department of General Operation of the GACC, noted that the GACC will focus on three main areas of work in order to further promote high-level opening-up.
Firstly, the GACC will strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation. It will collaborate with the World Customs Organization on a ""smart customs"" project, actively promote a smart customs partnership initiative within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation framework, and deepen institutional cooperation on inspection and quarantine with customs of neighboring countries such as Central Asian and ASEAN countries.
It will also promote the electronic origin networking with members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and expand international cooperation on mutual recognition of AEO (Authorized Economic Operator) status.
Secondly, the GACC will serve high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. On one hand, it will expand the connection with international trade single windows and promote cooperation between China and Belt and Road partner countries in this area. On the other hand, it will further support the establishment of efficient international logistics corridors that are compatible with new production and logistics methods, and facilitate the coordinated development of international logistics corridors such as the China-Europe freight train service, the new western land-sea corridor, and the China-Laos Railway.
Thirdly, the GACC will facilitate the construction of high-level opening-up platforms. The administration has been actively exploring and designing intelligent solutions to the innovation of regulatory systems and the application of advanced technologies, focusing on the development of opening-up platforms including the Hainan Free Trade Port, the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, comprehensive bonded zones and pilot free trade zones. It will continue to unleash the dividends of reform and contribute to the advancement of high-level institutional opening-up.

Promoting the construction of smart customs helps reduce trade costs and facilitates the clearance of personnel and goods. Currently, customs clearance in China is becoming smarter and smarter.
Thanks to the construction of an intelligent platform for cross-border trade in Hunchun, northeast China's Jilin province, border residents can complete online declarations on their mobile phones, reducing the average clearance time by nearly 70 percent. The platform also allows customs officials to establish stronger service and supervision collaboration with departments such as taxation, banking, and fisheries associations through data connectivity.
Multiple airports, such as Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Beijing Daxing International Airport, are utilizing new intelligent facilities and equipment, including integrated smart channels, intelligent robots, and non-intrusive advanced inspection systems, to provide convenient services for inbound and outbound travelers during the customs clearance process.
""By taking technology as our eyes and using information as our ears, we can create the best customs clearance environment for law-abiding travelers,"" said Xia Qian, an official with the Shanghai Customs.
According to Du, the GACC will promote the application of new technologies and facilities through optimizing non-intrusive supervision, and improve the level of automation in law enforcement operations in various fields such as maritime, land, air, rail, and postal services.

Legends, folktales behind China's lunar exploration
 (Xinhua) 16:59, March 21, 2024
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Queqiao-2, a relay satellite designed to provide Earth-Moon communication services, was launched Wednesday on a Long March-8 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Site in Hainan Province.
The Queqiao satellite series is just one facet of China's lunar exploration program that draws on the richness of the country's traditional legends and folktales. These stories have enriched the nation's culture and inspired its space exploration endeavors.
QUEQIAO
China sent the first Queqiao relay satellite to a halo orbit around the second Lagrangian (L2) point of the Earth-Moon system in 2018. The English translation of Queqiao is ""Magpie Bridge,"" its name embodying China's hope that the relay satellite could serve as a vital communication link between Earth-based controllers and the mysterious far side of the moon.
According to a Chinese folktale, Zhi Nyu, the seventh daughter of the Goddess of Heaven, and her beloved husband, Niu Lang, a humble cowherd, found their love forbidden and were separated to opposite sides of the Milky Way.
Moved by their plight, magpies intervened, creating the bridge with their wings on the seventh night of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, allowing the couple to reunite for just one day each year.
CHANG'E
In 2004, the lunar orbiter project was formally established, and the mission was named ""Project Chang'e"" after the mythical Chinese goddess.
In Chinese legend, Chang'e took a longevity potion and floated into the sky, eventually landing on the moon, where she became the moon goddess.
China's lunar probes, namely Chang'e-1, Chang'e-2, Chang'e-3, Chang'e-4 and Chang'e-5, are also the namesake of the goddess, and all have been sent to the moon on exploration missions.
Chang'e-6 is scheduled for launch in the first half of 2024, while Chang'e-7 will be launched around 2026, and Chang'e-8 around 2028.
YUTU
In Chinese mythology, Chang'e's pet is Yutu, the Jade Rabbit. It often appears grinding herbal medicines with a pestle in the Lunar Palace.
The rabbit's common association with Earth's only natural satellite led China to name its first moon rover ""Yutu,"" which was carried by the Chang'e-3 lunar probe, China's first moon lander. The combination of Yutu and Chang'e also reflects the close relation between the moon goddess and her pet.
In 2019, China sent another rabbit visitor to the moon. The Yutu-2 rover and Chang'e-4 lander, both part of the Chang'e-4 probe, soft-landed on the dark side of the moon -- a first for humanity.
Guang Han Gong
Guang Han Gong or Moon Palace, is the palace that houses Chang'e and her pet Yutu in Chinese mythology. It is a popular element in Chinese poems and paintings.
To mark the landing site of China's first moon lander Chang'e-3, the country named it ""Guang Han Gong"", which was approved by the International Astronomical Union in 2016.
The coordinates of ""Guang Han Gong"" are 44.12 degrees north latitude and 19.51 degrees west longitude on the moon, with a diameter of 154 meters.

China's homegrown hydrogen-powered train successfully completed a test run at full speed in Changchun, Northeast China’s Jilin Province on Thursday, the Global Times learned from CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles Co.
The train, which reached a speed of 160 kilometers per hour, marked a new breakthrough in hydrogen energy use in the rail transportation sector. It will advance China's independence in high-end railway equipment making and accelerate the building of new quality productive forces.
Unlike traditional trains that rely on fossil fuel or overhead wires as their power source, this hydrogen-powered train has an onboard hydrogen power system that provides sustainable and efficient energy. The train's energy consumption was measured at 5 kilowatt-hours per kilometer, meeting international standards and showcasing good energy efficiency.
It utilizes a hybrid power supply system with multiple energy storage and hydrogen systems, as well as a hydrogen-electric hybrid energy management strategy developed by CRRC Changchun. The integration of different systems significantly improves energy efficiency, flexibility, and reliability, and the maximum range can reach over 1,000 kilometers.
CRRC Changchun conducted various tests on the train's key components, as well as its energy consumption, reliability, traction, braking, and dynamics at different speed levels. The tests have proved that the train can operate between -25 C and 35 C temperatures, and that it meets the design requirements.
Hydrogen-powered trains are clean, easy to maintain, quick to build, and require a smaller initial investment. It can operate at fast speeds, high capacity, and integrates smart safety features which is ideal to connect city hubs, said CRRC Chuangchun.
The success of the test run comes as China is accelerating the development of hydrogen energy with specific plans in place. In total 22 Chinese provinces have included hydrogen energy in their government work reports, Chinese media outlet Jiemian reported.
South China's Guangdong Province plans to accelerate the production, storage, transportation, refueling, and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cell equipment for low-carbon industrial applications. East China's Zhejiang Province plans to build 50 hydrogen refueling stations by 2025.
Sales of hydrogen fueled vehicles in China reached 5,800 units in 2023, a 72 percent increase from the previous year. December saw a record-breaking monthly sale of 1,500 units, up 149.1 percent year-on-year.

US' crackdown efforts on more Chinese tech firms will backfire on itself: expert,2024-03-21,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0321/c90000-20147535.html,"Home>>
		
US' crackdown efforts on more Chinese tech firms will backfire on itself: expert
By Zhang Weilan (Global Times) 11:13, March 21, 2024
Amid reports that the US is considering blacklisting a number of Chinese semiconductor firms linked to tech giant Huawei Technologies, a Chinese industry expert said on Wednesday that the US will not be able to contain the rise of the Chinese chip industry and its crackdown efforts will backfire on the US itself.
The US has been trying to cut China off from the global chip supply chain by adopting various measures such as restricting US chip exports to China, pressuring its allies to join this effort and weighing sanctions on China's tech firms, Ma Jihua, a veteran telecom observer, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
""Although it has indulged in 'small yard and high fence' tactics, the US' efforts to suppress China's semiconductor industry and other high-tech sectors to contain the country's high-quality development has not been successful, and it will be difficult to achieve in the future,"" Ma noted.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg cited sources who said the administration of President Joe Biden is considering ""blacklisting a number of Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co after the telecom giant notched a significant technological breakthrough last year."" The companies that could be blacklisted include chipmakers Qingdao Si'En, SwaySure, and Shenzhen Pensun Technology Co, it said.
Huawei's chip developer HiSilicon is making steady progress in the field. HiSilicon's chip shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023 reached 6.8 million units, up more than 50 times year-on-year, media reports said, citing data from Canalys.
The Biden administration's efforts to curb China's high-tech industry have failed to halt the advancement of China's chip sector. Instead, they have only accelerated the drive for independent research and domestic substitution, pushing China further toward self-reliance in the area, Ma said.
While sparing no efforts to cut Huawei's access to leading global chipmakers, the US is also actively weighing another sanctions package on multiple firms. On March 9, Bloomberg reported that the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security is considering adding ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) and five other Chinese companies to the Entity List, which would limit their access to US technology.
This move is a response to the so-called ""national security concerns"" that have arisen in the wake of Huawei's success in coping with the US crackdown, said the expert, noting that should this materialize, it would not impede CXMT's capacity to develop advanced semiconductors, and would actually backfire on the US itself.
US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on March 11 during a recent visit to the Philippines that the US is constantly assessing the need to expand export controls to stop China from acquiring advanced computer chips and manufacturing equipment.
Such moves won't solve the problem of the hollowing out of the US manufacturing industry, nor can they prevent the upward development of China's chip industry, said the expert.
Given the endless US measures, China should strive for self-reliance in technology innovation through enhanced international cooperation, Ma said.
The expert also urged the US government to remove its high-tech clampdown on Chinese companies, in order to avoid disrupting global industry and supply chains.
China is one of the major semiconductor markets in the world. The US efforts will not stop China's innovation-driven development, nor will it do any good for US companies or the entire semiconductor industry, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a press conference on February 27.

XINING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- On the vast Jinyintan Grasslands in northwest China's Qinghai Province, a fluffy Chinese desert cat named Huang Tai Ji is roaming around in search of prey. It is hard to believe this adorable and inquisitive feline was a scared and injured creature only a few months ago.
According to its rescuers, Huang Tai Ji was caught in a mousetrap while hunting for chickens in a herder's yard in Qinghai's Haiyan County in June 2023. Listed as a national first-class protected animal in China, the Chinese desert cat is a precious feline species of great importance to ecological diversity.
Fortunately, the trap did not hurt its bones, and Huang Tai Ji was soon rescued and transported to Xining Wildlife Park in Qinghai's capital city of Xining for treatment.
The park decided to release Huang Tai Ji into the wild after about a month of treatment and recovery. Together with researchers from the College of Veterinary Medicine of China Agricultural University, rescuers set the cat free on July 23, 2023. A satellite positioning collar was attached to the animal.
It was the first time a Chinese desert cat was released with a satellite positioning device attached to it, said Qi Xinzhang, deputy director of Xining Wildlife Park.
""The collar collects information concerning its latitude, longitude, altitude, temperature, and even instantaneous velocity via GPS satellite positioning technology, and uploads the data every two hours,"" said Qi. Thanks to such information, Qi and his colleagues can effectively monitor the cat's condition and activities.
""We can tell from the collected data whether the cat is captured or injured, and thus offer timely aid should any emergency happen,"" he added.
The collar does not only provide researchers with quick solutions to saving the cat's life. In addition, Qi is able to pinpoint Huang Tai Ji's movement range on a satellite map, which revealed a total range measuring about 200 square kilometers, while highlighting a 36-square-kilometer area where the cat spent most of its time.
""Previous research suggested that the average active area of Chinese desert cats was only about 3.3 square kilometers. With insights provided by satellite positioning collars, we got to learn that the roaming area for this cat is much larger, shedding new light on related studies,"" said Qi.
Based on collected data, Xining Wildlife Park officials set up eight infrared cameras in the areas where Huang Tai Ji was most commonly found, and obtained lots of valuable information about the cat and other wild animals in this region.
""We now have a better understanding of the living environment, diet, and natural rivals of Chinese desert cats, all thanks to the satellite positioning collar,"" Qi said.
Satellite positioning technology not only offers a more efficient way to protect and study the Chinese desert cat, but is also empowering wildlife preservation in various other places in China.
According to a report released by China's Beidou Navigation Satellite System, satellite positioning devices have been used for the protection and research of endangered animals ranging from Asian elephants to giant pandas. In addition to accurate positioning data, the system also offers innovative functions including signal-free telegraph communication, enabling field researchers to track animals in remote areas.
Qi believes technologies like satellite positioning are the future of wildlife preservation.
""We will keep releasing rescued Chinese desert cats fitted with satellite positioning collars, and initiate artificial breeding of these cats based on what we have learned,"" Qi said.

New plant species discovered in China's Hubei,2024-03-20,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0320/c90000-20147292.html,"Home>>
		
New plant species discovered in China's Hubei
 (Xinhua) 16:50, March 20, 2024
WUHAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese researchers has discovered a new species of asparagus in the Dabie Mountains in central China's Hubei Province and named it Asparagus dabieshanensis, according to the Wuhan Botanical Garden (WBG), under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The discovery was recently published in the journal Phytotaxa.
After over 40 field surveys across the Dabie Mountains region, the team discovered this formerly unknown species, which was later observed extensively. The team then collected comprehensive information on its flowers, fruit and seeds.
Detailed morphological comparisons and molecular systematic analysis confirmed it as a new species of the family Asparagaceae. Due to its current discovery only in the Dabie Mountains region, the team designated it as Asparagus dabieshanensis.
According to the team, the new species is similar to A. cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr. and A. filicinus D. Don morphologically, but differs from the two species in its long and straight cladodes (the flattened leaflike stem), and shorter pedicel (the small stalk bearing an individual flower).
Yang Jiaxin, the first author of the paper and a doctoral candidate at WBG, noted that most plants in the genus Asparagus hold considerable economic importance, as they are commonly used as ornamental plants and ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine. Whether the new species has related economic value will be further studied.
Although three populations of this new species have been discovered in the Dabie Mountains region, their numbers are exceedingly low. According to the criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, the new species should be provisionally categorized as vulnerable and receive strengthened protection, Yang added.
