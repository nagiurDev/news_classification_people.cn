With the greater presence of high-tech enterprises, China's largest trade expo will enable participants this year to tap into new business opportunities in emerging sectors and inject much-needed energy into sluggish global trade, said experts and executives.
The China Import and Export Fair, also known as the Canton Fair, kicked off its 135th edition on Monday in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, and is scheduled to run through May 5.
The country's major trade event continues to embrace digital technology and intelligent manufacturing, with nearly 3,600 participating companies in this field showcasing more than 90,000 intelligent products, such as artificial intelligence-powered translator devices and automated guided vehicles.
The increasing focus on high-tech products and technological advancements at the trade fair serves as evidence of China's transformation from a labor-intensive manufacturing powerhouse to a major technology-driven industry player, said Bai Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Amid a challenging external environment, products with high-tech content are gaining a competitive edge and have emerged as the key to breaking through the current global slump in foreign trade, Bai added.
With exhibition venues covering 1.55 million square meters, this year's event features around 28,600 companies participating in the export section, including more than 4,300 first-timers. In addition, 680 companies will participate in the import section.
Bekar Mikaberidze, founder of the Belt and Road Georgian Business House, said the fair has become synonymous with discovering fresh prospects and exploring untapped markets. He has participated in the event for more than a decade.
With each visit to the fair, attendees are able to witness the emergence of new trends and technologies driving industry development, and identify potential investment or collaboration prospects, Mikaberidze said.
The trade fair will showcase a wide range of new products, with the number expected to top 1 million. Among these will be more than 450,000 environmentally friendly products and more than 250,000 offerings involving indigenous intellectual property rights.
With an array of improved products, Bella Intelligent Information Technology Co, a Guangzhou-based massage-products manufacturer, is focused on making the most of the Canton Fair, at which 140,000 overseas buyers from 215 countries and regions had signed up as of Saturday for broader business partnerships.
The fair has proved to be an invaluable platform for launching new ventures, expanding market reach and staying ahead of the competition, said Zeng Zhitao, the company's chairman.
The fair comes as international trade is grappling with a period of sluggishness and uncertainty. Global trade, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, saw a 3 percent contraction, roughly equaling $1 trillion, in 2023.
Although the World Trade Organization said earlier this month that it expected global trade volume to increase by 2.6 percent in 2024, it warned that geopolitical tensions continue to pose a significant risk to its outlook, as signs of trade fragmentation rise.
Christophe Benard, general manager of Schneider Consumer Asia, said that China's commitment to openness, innovation and development will continue to drive opportunities and prosperity despite global economic uncertainties.
Data released by the General Administration of Customs showed that the country's foreign trade in goods climbed 5 percent year-on-year to 10.17 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in the first quarter.

China develops new generation heavy-ion accelerator for cancer treatment,2024-04-15,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0415/c90000-20156896.html,"Home>>
		
China develops new generation heavy-ion accelerator for cancer treatment
 (Xinhua) 14:09, April 15, 2024
LANZHOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- In a hospital in Wuwei, northwest China's Gansu Province, a medical facility consisting of large pieces of steel and complex coils occupies a building of 30 meters high. The high-speed carbon ions produced by it are channeled into the treatment room to kill the tumor cells of cancer patients.
The advanced medical facility, called heavy-ion accelerator, is assisting human's fight against cancers. However, due to its large size, high production and maintenance costs, it has not been widely used in ordinary hospitals.
""We are developing a new generation heavy-ion accelerators for medical use, so that the treatment is more accessible to ordinary patients,"" said Hu Zhengguo, deputy director of the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
CANCER KILLER
As a physical therapy method, radiation therapy has a history of over 100 years. The conventional radiotherapy, usually using X-rays or gamma rays, is prone to complications due to its inability to distinguish normal cells and cancer cells.
Scientists have found that heavy-ion beams can pass through normal tissue cells without causing any harm, and only release energy when they reach tumors.
Research shows that the relative biological effect of heavy-ions is about three times higher than that of conventional photon rays. That means heavy-ion beams could have a greater ""killing power"" on cancer cells, leading to a higher probability of DNA double-strand breakage in cancer cells and better preventing cancer cell residue and recurrence. By adjusting the energy and direction of the ions, precise delivery of the radiation dose to the tumor can be achieved with an accuracy of millimeters, while effectively sparing normal organs, experts say.
Heavy-ion radiotherapy is currently recognized internationally as one of the advanced radiotherapy methods. It's suitable for the treatment of some solid tumors that are unsuitable for surgery, insensitive to conventional radiation, and prone to recurrence after conventional radiation therapy, said Zhang Yanshan, vice president of the Wuwei Tumor Hospital.
BENEFITING CANCER PATIENTS
China launched the research and development of the heavy-ion accelerator for cancer treatment in early 1990s. It took the research team from IMP, which has a long history of developing heavy-ion accelerators, about three decades to achieve the transformation from a huge scientific device to a large-scale high-end medical equipment, said Hu.
They shortened the circumference of the synchronous accelerator from 161 meters used in scientific experiments to 56.2 meters, making it the smallest synchrotron system among medical heavy-ion accelerators in the world.
This project made China the fourth country in the world after the United States, Germany and Japan to have the ability to independently develop heavy-ion therapy system and clinical applications.
Compared with imported equipment, China's self-developed heavy-ion therapy facility has low operation and maintenance costs, and can provide continuous technical upgrade services, said Yang Wenjie, deputy general manager of the Lanzhou Ion Therapy Co. Ltd., a company affiliated to IMP and responsible for the development and production of the heavy-ion therapy facility.
In clinical trials, the five-year survival rate of 46 cancer participants reached 64.04 percent, Yang said.
Since the facility was put into use in the Wuwei Tumor Hospital in March 2020, more than 1,100 Chinese patients, as well as patients from Belgium and Australia, have received treatment, involving over 50 kinds of cancers including lung cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and glioma, said Zhang.
So far, 204 patients of lung cancer, which has the highest incident rate among all the cancers in China, have received treatment by using the facility, and the 24-month survival rate after treatment reached 68.65 percent.
In addition to the facility in Wuwei, seven similar facilities have been constructed or being constructed in hospitals in other cities such as Putian, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing and Changchun. And the number of the facilities is expected to reach 20 in the coming five years.
NEW GENERATION FACILITY
The existing equipment, however, cannot meet the needs of China's vast cancer patient population.
Making the equipment smaller will be the future development direction of the medical heavy-ion accelerators. And only by lowering the price of the treatment can more cancer patients enjoy the benefits brought by this new technology.
""Although the circumference of our first generation medical heavy-ion accelerator is the shortest among similar products in the world, the space utilization rate of our first generation product is not high. We hope to use new technologies to develop the next generation miniaturized devices to improve space utilization,"" said Hu.
""We hope to reduce the coverage area of the medical heavy-ion accelerator from 4,600 square meters to 1,500 square meters, and improve the facility performance while reducing its production costs,"" Hu said.
Researchers are trying two technological routes to achieve miniaturization. One is based on the new technologies developed by IMP and exquisite designs, and the other is through superconducting technology, according to Hu.
The superconducting technology route is mainly being developed by the Lanzhou Ion Therapy Co. Ltd., with an aim to develop a new generation system with compact structure, superior performance and lower power consumption by 2027, according to Yang.
""We hope that more hospitals could be equipped with the heavy-ion therapy system in the future to benefit more cancer patients."" Hu added.

HONG KONG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- This week in Victoria Harbor of Hong Kong, as the sea fog gradually cleared on Monday morning, a giant ship of red and white came into sight. It slowly sailed into Tsim Sha Tsui Ocean Terminal to began its visit to Hong Kong.
""Xuelong 2, Hong Kong welcomes you!"" At the harborfront, some people chanted enthusiastically, waving the national flags in their hands.
Put into service in 2019, Xuelong 2 or Snow Dragon 2, measuring 122.5 meters long and 22.3 meters wide, is China's first domestically made polar icebreaker, capable of breaking ice 1.5 meters high and snow 0.2 meters thick.
""This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's polar expedition, and Hong Kong was the first stop of Xuelong 2's homebound voyage after the country's 40th Antarctic expedition. This is a gift for us from the country,"" Ho Kin Chung, chairman of an executive committee of Xuelong 2's visit, said with excitement.
Twenty years ago, icebreaker Xuelong visited Hong Kong and was warmly welcomed. Now China has made remarkable achievements in polar exploration, making the people of Hong Kong feel excited and proud.
As early as in 1999, Ho boarded Xuelong to participate in China's first Arctic scientific expedition.
""Xuelong is an unidirectional icebreaker and it takes more than 10 hours to turn around in a fixed ice area. Xuelong 2 has the world's advanced bidirectional icebreaking technology, which can reduced the time to about half an hour,"" Ho said.
The past 20 years since Xuelong's first visit to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have witnessed steady advancements in China's capability to design and build the Antarctic research vessel, Ho said.
In 2004 when Xuelong came to Hong Kong, Ho was a visitor. This time he became an organizer of Xuelong 2's visit and engaged in the preparatory work from September last year.
Xuelong 2 completed a five-day visit to Hong Kong and began its return journey to Shanghai on Friday. During its stay in the HKSAR, China's 40th Antarctic expedition team shared stories of scientists' struggles in work and life in the polar regions with Hong Kong people.
""The South Pole is extremely difficult,"" Wei Fuhai, deputy leader of the expedition team, said.
Extremely low temperature, sudden snowstorm and unknown abyss beneath the ice made each expedition not only a battle against the hostile environment, but also a test of the researchers' determination and perseverance to explore the polar world.
The Antarctic summer, which runs from December to February, is supposed to be the prime time for the research work. However, in January of this year, a sudden category 12 hurricane put the expedition team to face the biggest challenge of their Antarctic mission.
""The team members were challenging their limits in the unknown test, in order to help mankind better understand the Antarctic, protect it and use it,"" Wei said.
The scientists' sharing has brought ""polar spirit"" to Hong Kong, enhancing young people's sense of national pride and encouraging students to pursue their dreams.
""When I realized that a group of Chinese polar explorers are making contributions to the development of mankind and the world, come rain or shine, there is an undescribable glory felt in my heart,"" Evelyn Ji, a student from Pui Kiu Middle School, said.
Middle school student Chen Kai Yuan was deeply moved by the determination of the researchers to overcome difficulties and their selfless dedication. The young chemistry lover said he hopes to do something for China's polar expedition.
""I want to develop a medicine that can prevent frostbite in extremely cold weather, so that the team can carry out polar expedition safely,"" Chen, who aspires to be a pharmacist, said.
To help the young people in Hong Kong understand more about the polar regions and encourage them to devote themselves to related research fields, Ho founded Polar Research Institute of Hong Kong in 2018.
""I want to sow the seeds of polar exploration in the hearts of Hong Kong students,"" He said, hoping these seeds will one day take root, sprout, grow and bloom.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Soil carbon usually refers only to the organic matter component of soils, known as soil organic carbon (SOC). However, soil carbon also has an inorganic component, known as soil inorganic carbon (SIC).
Solid SIC, often calcium carbonate, tends to accumulate more in arid regions with infertile soils, which has led many to believe it is not important.
In a study recently published in the journal Science, a team of researchers led by Huang Yuanyuan from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Zhang Ganlin from the Institute of Soil Science of the CAS, have quantified the global store of SIC, challenging the long-held view.
The researchers found a whopping 2,305 billion tonnes of carbon stored as SIC in the top two meters of soil worldwide, which is more than five times the carbon found in all of the world's vegetation. This hidden pool of soil carbon could be key to understanding how carbon moves around the globe.
This huge carbon pool is vulnerable to changes in the environment, especially soil acidification. Acids dissolve calcium carbonate and remove it either as carbon dioxide gas or directly into the water, Huang said.

""Many regions in countries like China and India are experiencing soil acidification due to industrial activities and intense farming. Without remedial actions and better soil practices, the world is likely to face a disturbance of SIC in the next 30 years,"" she added.
Disturbances to SIC accumulated over Earth's history have a profound impact on soil health. This disruption compromises the soil's ability to neutralize acidity, regulate nutrient levels, foster plant growth, and stabilize organic carbon.
Essentially, SIC plays a critical dual role in storing carbon and supporting ecosystem functions that depend on it.
The researchers revealed that approximately 1.13 billion tonnes of inorganic carbon are lost from soils to inland waters each year. This loss has profound but often overlooked implications for carbon transport among land, atmosphere, freshwater and ocean.
While society has recognized the importance of soils as a fundamental part of nature-based solutions to combat climate change, much of the focus has been on SOC. The study indicates that SIC deserves equal attention.
The study underscores the urgency of incorporating inorganic carbon into climate change mitigation strategies as an additional lever for maintaining and enhancing carbon sequestration.
International programs such as the ""4 per 1000"" Initiative, which aims to increase SOC by 0.4 percent annually, should also consider the critical role of inorganic carbon in achieving sustainable soil management and climate mitigation goals.
By broadening the understanding of soil carbon dynamics to include both organic and inorganic carbon, the researchers hope to develop more effective strategies for maintaining soil health, enhancing ecosystem services, and mitigating climate change.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's self-developed actuators have been applied to the country's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and have been running smoothly for months without any faults.
There are over 2,000 mirror surfaces on the telescope, and the main role of the actuators is to continuously adjust the angles of these mirror surfaces, thereby ensuring that the telescope functions at its optimal capacity.
However, due to the need for uninterrupted 24-hour operation in harsh outdoor environments, actuators demand extremely high reliability and durability in terms of both lifespan and performance.
After two years of hard work, the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology overcame various technical challenges and successfully developed actuators boasting high reliability, extended lifespan, minimal noise and low heat emission.
The new actuators now meet the operational requirements of the FAST project following their optimization. Next, the project team will further enhance their performance -- with focus on intelligent fault diagnosis.

Chinese scientists design large-scale photonic chiplet for artificial general intelligence
 (Xinhua) 10:21, April 13, 2024
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has designed a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) chip based on photonics instead of traditional electronic transistors, paving way for large-scale photonic computing and efficient real-world AI applications.
The rapid development of AI imposes stringent energy efficiency and area efficiency requirements on next-generation computing. Optical intelligent computing has shown great potential in achieving superior processing speeds and high energy efficiency. This is believed to be a next-generation computing paradigm that could solve the AI challenges in computing capacity and energy consumption.
However, existing optical computing has failed to realize its real potential for general-purpose intelligent computation. It can only handle simple AI tasks, such as digit classifications or small-scale pattern recognition.
The study, published on Friday in the journal Science, reported a large-scale photonic chiplet along with a distributed optical computing architecture named ""Taichi."" Developed by researchers from Tsinghua University, Taichi can solve advanced AI tasks with high computing capacity and high energy efficiency.
Instead of going ""deeper"" as electronic computing, Taichi architecture goes ""broader"" for throughput and scale expansion, which means larger parallel computing, according to the study.
With the help from the large-scale interference-diffraction-hybrid photonic AI chiplet, the network scale was effectively increased to billion-neuron-level, supporting a variety of advanced AGI tasks.
Taichi has achieved high accuracy in complex classification tasks, such as 100-category ImageNet and 1,623-category Omniglot datasets. It is also capable of performing high-fidelity tasks such as music composing and generating styled paintings, according to the study.
Furthermore, it has realized 160-tera-operations per second per watt energy efficiency, a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to current photonic integrated circuits, and two orders of magnitude above traditional AI chips in energy efficiency, said Fang Lu from Tsinghua University, the corresponding author of the paper.
""We anticipate that Taichi will accelerate the development of more powerful optical solutions, such as critical support for the foundation model and a new era of AGI,"" said Fang.

Chinese scientists construct database of nutrient concentrations in Chinese lakes
 (Xinhua) 10:17, April 13, 2024
LANZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have constructed a database of nutrient concentrations in Chinese lake sediments, which reveals their historical changes and can be used to predict water quality and environmental conditions in various lake areas.
Lakes provide important reserves of freshwater resources for human survival and development, and an increase or decrease in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations can reflect the corresponding deterioration or improvement of water quality, said Chen Jianhui, leader of the researchers from the College of Earth and Environmental Sciences of Lanzhou University.
However, the relatively brief history of monitoring nutrient levels in Chinese lake waters limits the understanding of the causes of their eutrophication and constrains effective lake management. Fortunately, the nutrient concentrations in lake sediments can faithfully reflect the nutrient levels of lake waters and thus help reconstruct their historical evolution, according to Chen.
Using a compilation of published nutrient data from lake sediments and data from newly collected lake sediment cores, the research team, also composed of scientists from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Hainan University, obtained the historical records of changes in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of 69 lakes in six lake regions across China, and subsequently reconstructed trends in nutrient accumulation in Chinese lakes between 1850 and 2020.
The researchers also conducted a quantitative analysis of this database and existing datasets of climatic, economic, and environmental factors, and found that nitrogen concentrations in lakes generally show a decreasing trend from 2030 to 2100, while phosphorus concentrations will continue to increase in some lake districts.
These results provide a valuable reference for understanding changes in regional lake water quality and assessing the health of lake ecosystems. They also highlight the need for China to develop customized regional lake management strategies from zonal and elemental perspectives, according to the researchers.

Since 5G was commercialized in 2019, the number of 5G users around the world has exceeded 1.5 billion, making it an important driving force for high-quality economic and social development.
With the continuous iteration of telecommunications technology and emergence of new terminals and business models, 5G-Advanced, also known as 5G-A or 5.5G, has emerged. Combined with new technologies such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), passive IoT, and intrinsic intelligence, 5G-A can enhance network performance by 10 times and meet the demands of more complex and diverse application scenarios.
Currently, many countries and regions around the world are rapidly embracing 5G-A to unleash its development potential.
For the production side, 5G-A features significantly enhanced connectivity and ubiquitous connection. It creates new possibilities for industries such as intelligent transportation and smart manufacturing.
For example, a factory in east China's Shandong province has achieved automated inspection, rapid fault isolation and power restoration, thanks to the application of 5G-A-enabled distributors and circuit breakers, as well as drones and robots. The inspection efficiency has increased by 24 times, and the average annual power outage duration has been reduced from 5.4 hours to 25 minutes.
So far, 5G-A has seeped into core production sectors. For instance, it has been employed on an automated car roof production line of a factory, ensuring faster and more stable movements of robotic arms with its powerful network performance that enables ultra-low latency and super stable wireless connections.
In a factory of Chinese home appliance manufacturer Midea in Jingzhou, central China's Hubei province, 5G-A is employed throughout the entire production process, significantly improving the production efficiency. Every seven seconds, there is a washing machine rolling off the production line.
For the consumption side, 5G-A can bring consumers better experiences in immersive services and home broadband services, and provide support for smart homes, smart tourism, and more. The upgrade in network bandwidth offers technical support for users to watch 4K and 8K high-definition videos, and promotes the large-scale application of immersive services such as naked-eye 3D and extended reality, thus allowing consumers to enjoy a brand-new mobile internet experience. For instance, during the 19th Asian Games last year, a mini app was launched to offer immersive 3D game-watching experience.
Global telecommunications operators and equipment manufacturers are actively laying groundwork and pursuing innovation in the 5G-A domain. During the recent 2024 Mobile World Congress, multiple global mobile communications companies and operators, including Qualcomm, Ericsson, Huawei, and ZTE, released 5G-A-related technologies, products, and service solutions. Nearly 60 companies jointly launched an initiative ""Embracing Year One of 5G-A Commercialization.""

So far, over 30 operators in countries including Finland, Malaysia, Brazil, and Turkey have completed technological verification of 5G-A, and the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have started preparing for 5G-A commercialization.
China is accelerating the commercial deployment of 5G-A. China Mobile, the world's largest telecom carrier by mobile subscribers, announced that it will deploy 5G-A commercial networks in over 300 cities this year. It has already released a list of the first 100 cities.
China Unicom, another Chinese telecommunications company, has developed a 5G-A-based ultra-high-definition shallow compression encoding and real-time production system, setting a global record for the highest uplink bit rate.
In many Chinese provinces and municipalities, China Telecom has built over 100 stations for three-component carrier aggregation (3CC). It is also exploring the application of 5G-A in multiple industries such as steel making, mining, healthcare.
Huawei, as a global leading equipment manufacturer, released the world's first full-series solutions for 5G-A in October 2023, supporting the commercial development of 5G-A with three innovative technologies: Native 10 Gbps, Native Green, and Native Intelligence.
5G-A represents a critical phase in the evolution from 5G to 6G, serving as a bridge between the two generations. Last June, the International Telecommunication Union approved the new Recommendation on the “IMT-2030 Framework” (IMT stands for International Mobile Telecommunications, aka 6G), outlining the vision and consensus for 6G. Around 70 percent of the key technologies involved overlap with the current 5G-A standards under research. Therefore, the development of 5G-A is also a precursor to cultivating the industrial elements for 6G, laying the groundwork for its eventual deployment. This year, the world is expected to achieve large-scale commercial application of 5G-A, which will usher in a more intelligent and convenient era.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's advancements in space technology have the potential to revolutionize food preservation on Earth, with spacecraft engineers repurposing a cutting-edge barrier film, originally designed for the orbital space station, to effectively maintain the health and freshness of people's daily meals.
This innovative achievement was recently unveiled by the China Academy of Space Technology, in the form of an advanced flexible film that can block gases and germs, providing exceptional protection for food.
The academy presented a video showcasing lab researchers dividing a piece of tofu into two parts and placing each in separate transparent packages -- one regular and one made of the new high-barrier film. After seven days, it was observed that the tofu stored in the regular package had decayed, while the tofu contained within the high-barrier material remained fresh.
Cai Yuhong, a member of the research team, said that the current barrier film widely used for food preservation in the Chinese market is a silver aluminum-foil film, like that commonly found inside potato chip packaging. However, this aluminized film has certain drawbacks, such as opacity and unsuitability for microwave processing, making it non-recyclable. Only a few countries can produce more advanced films.
""The new high-barrier film we developed draws inspiration from space coating technology,"" Cai said.
The original purpose of this coating technology was to protect the cables of the space station from atomic oxygen. In low-orbital space, sunlight can break down oxygen molecules into atomic oxygen, which can erode spacecraft materials and components. Therefore, engineers apply a barrier coating to prevent erosion.

It is also necessary to package food and medicine to prevent the entry of water vapor and oxygen, as they can lead to the growth of microbes and result in spoilage, Cai added.
Since 2016, the academy has proposed the concept of utilizing space coating technology for the development of next-generation high-barrier films. It established teams to carry out equipment development and process research in this field.
The development process was quite challenging, Cai recalled. Despite the technical principles being similar to aerospace products, there are limited foreign technologies available for reference. After four years of exploration, the research team has achieved significant progress in core technologies and successfully established China's first high-barrier film production line and mass production line.
The high-barrier film has very stringent requirements for water resistance, according to Dong Maojin, who is responsible for the product's development.
Laboratory tests showed that the film's water vapor transmission rate was just 0.2 grams per square meter per day. Dong drew an analogy: ""If a football field was covered with such a film, the amount of water molecules that could pass through it each day would be the size of your thumb.""

The new high-barrier film is increasingly used for packaging high-end food, such as caviar and white truffles. When the cost decreases, the scope of its application will expand, Dong said.
According to the research team, such high-barrier packaging materials could potentially serve as an alternative to food preservation in the future, reducing or even eliminating the need for additives in food. This would both ensure the quality of food and extend its shelf life.

"China's humanoid robot market to hit 10 billion yuan, eyes 119 billion yuan by 2030: report",2024-04-12,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0412/c90000-20156163.html,"Home>>
		
China's humanoid robot market to hit 10 billion yuan, eyes 119 billion yuan by 2030: report
By Leng Shumei (Global Times) 09:26, April 12, 2024
Research unveiled during the inaugural China Humanoid Robot Industry Conference in Beijing from April 9 to 10 indicates that the global humanoid robot industry is entering a golden era, poised for sustained growth. The report predicted that the Chinese humanoid robot market will surpass 10 billion yuan, reaching 10.47 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) by 2026, and is anticipated to soar to 119 billion yuan by 2030.
The booming market is seemingly telling people that intelligent humanoid robots that can simulate human thinking and consciousness, as depicted in films like Ex Machina and A.I. Artificial Intelligence, are really getting closer to reality.
The rapid development of AI technology has played a crucial role in the advancement of humanoid robots. As NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said at the 2024 GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March, ""Building foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today.""
In return, the advancement of humanoid robots is viewed as a major milestone in the AI era, pushing the boundaries of AI research. Numerous Chinese experts and industry observers consider humanoid robots a breakthrough for the ""AI Plus"" initiative aimed at fostering innovative development in the digital economy, as promoted during the two sessions in March.
Golden Age along with AI
Humanoid robots are dubbed ""humanoid"" because they are designed to emulate and potentially surpass human capabilities in form, function, behavior, and even cognitive processes, Zhang Rui, founder and executive director of the Art Robot company in Beijing, told the Global Times.
""Without the need for massive changes to the existing environment, humanoid robots can seamlessly integrate into various scenarios, using their flexible and dynamic execution capabilities to meet complex and changing task requirements. Furthermore, their human-like characteristics enable them to easily manipulate human tools, further expanding their application areas,"" Zhang said.
Therefore, humanoid robots are not only a symbol of technological progress but also a significant force driving future social development, he noted.
Humanoid robots have been widely applied in various industries, with the aerospace sector being one of the most prominent, according to Zhang. Several countries including the US, Russia and China, have been deeply researching the application of humanoid robots in the aerospace field. These robots are mainly used to replace humans in performing dangerous and complex operations, ensuring the safety of astronauts and improving the efficiency and success rate of space missions.
Other major application areas of humanoid robots are in border defense and lights-out factories, or smart factories.
""The continuous innovation and breakthroughs in AI technology in recent years have indeed provided humanoid robots with more powerful perception, decision-making, and execution capabilities. This allows humanoid robots to more accurately understand human language, recognize environmental information, and make more reasonable decisions and actions,"" Zhang said.
In the future, Zhang expects humanoid robots to have enormous potential in areas such as general hardware execution, dynamic adaptation and environmental integration.
How far is AGI?
The thriving progress of humanoid robots is drawing increasing attention from international tech giants. On March 18, nine humanoid robots were unveiled at NVIDIA's 2024 GTC. Tesla is also actively working on a humanoid robot named Optimus, and OpenAI, Microsoft, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have made substantial investments in humanoid robot startup Figure AI. Additionally, Agility Robotics, backed by Amazon, has established the world's first large-scale humanoid robot production factory in Oregon, the US, capable of producing 10,000 two-legged robots annually.
A group of innovative and competitive Chinese companies have also emerged in the field of humanoid robots with increasing emphasis and investment in robot technology in China, leading to significant progress in the Chinese humanoid robot industry.
In March, the Beijing humanoid robot innovation center announced that it would soon release the first generation of a universal open humanoid robot body.
Among the nine robots showcased at the NVIDIA 2024 GTC, two were developed by Chinese companies, namely H1 from Hangzhou Yushu Technology and PX5 from Xiaopeng Pengxing.
The Global Times learned from Yushu Technology that H1 is a full-size humanoid robot capable of running, equipped with 360 panoramic depth perception. Currently, it can reach a speed of 3.3 meters per second, setting a world record for full-size electric humanoid robots, with a potential speed of up to 5 meters per second.
This robot boasts highly advanced full-body dynamic coordination capabilities, enabling it to dance in groups and execute backflips. As a result, NVIDIA opted to partner with Yushu to collectively propel the global advancement of AI robots. According to the company's response to the Global Times, NVIDIA, a frontrunner in GPU and AI chip technology, furnishes Yushu's robots with robust computing capabilities and comprehensive support in deep learning technology.
However, overall, the deep integration of AI and humanoid robots still faces significant challenges.
Zhang believes hardware challenges are a crucial obstacle. While we can achieve various complex functions and performance at the algorithm level, it is often difficult to achieve the desired output power and efficiency in actual robot hardware, he said.
This is mainly due to the numerous technical details and engineering challenges involved in hardware design and manufacturing, requiring continuous optimization and improvement, Zhang explained.
On the other hand, the current progress of AI technology is mainly limited to deepening and innovating at the logical level, with insufficient breakthroughs in thinking and emotional aspects. While the form of robots is malleable, the ""spirit"" of their internal thinking and emotions is still an unexplored frontier. Zhang believes it will take another 5-10 years to achieve a 70 percent similarity with human emotions.
At an economic forum held at Stanford University in March, Jensen Huang predicted that a general artificial intelligence that can pass human tests, or ""human-like"" artificial general intelligence (AGI, capable of performing all human intelligent behaviors), is likely to appear within five years. However, Huang also pointed out that achieving this goal is not without difficulties, as scientists still lack a unified definition of how the human mind operates, making it challenging for engineers to achieve the goal.
On April 8, Elon Musk said during a livestreamed interview on X that AI that is smarter than any one human will probably come around by the end of next year. Last year, he predicted that humans would ""fully"" achieve general artificial intelligence by 2029.
Some experts believe that with the continuous advancement of chips and algorithms, AI may eventually surpass human intelligence. However, Liu Wei, director of the human-machine interaction and cognitive engineering laboratory of the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, pointed out that AGI may be a false proposition. This is not because current AI systems have not reached the level of general intelligence, but because AI fundamentally performs and learns like humans.
The development of AGI faces three major bottlenecks: technical, biological, and social. The technical bottleneck lies in the need for AI systems to have higher computing power, more advanced algorithms, and more efficient data processing methods to achieve more complex and intelligent functions. The biological bottleneck mainly stems from our limited understanding of the cognitive capabilities and operation mechanisms of the human brain, requiring deeper research in neuroscience and cognition to achieve similar levels of intelligence. The social bottleneck includes the integration of AI systems with human society, such as cultural differences, ethical issues, privacy protection, etc., all of which are crucial factors affecting the development of AI, according to Liu.
""To overcome these bottlenecks, interdisciplinary cooperation and continuous innovation efforts are needed. Only by making breakthroughs in technology, biology and society can AGI move towards more mature and comprehensive development, but it remains extremely difficult, perhaps impossible after all,"" Liu said.
Safety and ethics concerns
In November 2023, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China issued guiding opinions on the innovation and development of humanoid robots, proposing to establish a preliminary innovation system for humanoid robots by 2025.
The document predicted that, by 2025, key technologies such as those related to robots' ""brain, cerebellum, limbs"" will achieve breakthroughs, ensuring the safe and effective supply of core components. The whole machine products will reach international advanced levels, achieve mass production, and be demonstrated in special, manufacturing, and civil service scenarios, exploring effective governance mechanisms and means. By 2027, China's comprehensive strength in humanoid robots will reach world-class levels, becoming an important new engine for economic growth.
The development of the humanoid robot industry, driven by both technology and policy, has entered the fast lane of development, but it also faces challenges in safety, social ethics, and legal norms. Some experts point out that in scenarios requiring close contact, such as in elderly care or assistance, where physical contact is needed, the safety and risk issues of humanoid robots cannot be underestimated. More research is needed by the industry and relevant regulatory authorities on the technical and application scenarios.
Zhang believes that when unexpected situations occur with humanoid robots in a home environment, the lack of clear legal definitions makes it difficult to determine responsibility and protect rights. Additionally, there is currently no mandatory system for certifying the eligibility of humanoid robot products, making it challenging to distribute products in large quantities and limiting the widespread application of humanoid robots. Therefore, it is essential to address and resolve these legal gaps as soon as possible to ensure the healthy and orderly advancement of humanoid robots in the future.
However, he firmly believes that with the continuous progress of technology and the gradual improvement of regulations, humanoid robots will demonstrate their unique charm in more fields, contributing more to the development of human society.
In 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, together with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and 10 other departments, issued the trial ethical review measures for science and technology.
According to the measures, carrying out scientific and technological activities should adhere to the unity of promoting innovation and preventing risks. It involves objectively evaluating and prudently handling uncertainties and risks of technological applications, following the principles of enhancing human well-being, respecting the rights of life, upholding fairness and justice, reasonably controlling risks, and maintaining openness and transparency in science and technology ethics. It is essential to comply with the Constitution, laws, and regulations of China, relevant provisions, and ethical norms of science and technology.

China accelerates efforts to develop brain-computer interface technology
By Gu Yekai, Yang Yanfan (People's Daily) 16:39, April 11, 2024
Beijing-based Xuanwu Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University and a team at Tsinghua University successfully implanted a wireless brain-computer interface (BCI) processor into the skull of a paralyzed man during a clinical trial this January, significantly recovering his motor skills.
Thanks to the implantation, the man is now able to drink a bottle of water on his own via an air-filled glove.

Controlling movements through brain electrical activity, allowing brain cells to ""interact"" with computers via tiny electrical currents...These scenarios, once found only in sci-fi novels, are gradually becoming reality with the development and application of BCI technology.
BCI is a cutting-edge technology in the field of human-computer interaction and human-machine hybrid intelligence. It is believed to have the potential to promote economic and social development and improve people's health and well-being in the future.
The medical and health sector is the primary application area for BCI. According to Luo Minmin, co-director of the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing, BCI has promising future applications, including decoding language and movement for patients with high paraplegia, treating epilepsy, depression, and even converting images into electrical signals to stimulate the visual cortex and restore some vision for people with visual impairment.
BCI integrates advanced theories and cutting-edge technologies from multiple disciplines. In recent years, the engineering and industrialization of BCI has accelerated significantly, largely due to the development of biomedical engineering, neural engineering and rehabilitation engineering, cognitive neuroscience and psychology, and artificial intelligence.
For instance, Juliano Pinto, a Brazilian who has paralysis, took the first kick of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil under the assistance of BCI. In 2016, Chinese astronauts on China's Shenzhou-11 manned spacecraft completed in-orbit verification of BCI. Multiple international teams are implementing BCI technology to assist patients in typing and speaking with their mind.
China attaches great importance to the development of BCI technology. According to the Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025), in brain-like intelligence and other areas of cutting-edge technology and industrial transformation, China will organize and implement the plan for incubating and accelerating industries of the future, and plan and create a layout for such industries.

In recent years, China's BCI innovation ecosystem has been continuously improved, with continuous technological advancements and a growing range of product and service offerings. The industry is moving towards large-scale development.
In early 2023, the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing initiated an intelligent BCI enhancement program which aims to break through key technologies in invasive BCI and achieve initial clinical applications in three to five years. Besides, the institute has also established an entrepreneur and investment foundation and NeuCyber NeuroTech (Beijing) Company Ltd. in cooperation with other organizations.
So far, NeuCyber NeuroTech (Beijing) Company Ltd. has initiated more than 10 innovation projects in partnership with multiple Chinese universities and achieved significant progress in research and development. Li Yuan, business development director of the company, told People's Daily that one of the BCI systems developed by the company utilizes cortical electrode technology, and its key components such as flexible high-density cortical electrodes and high-performance brainwave data acquisition device have been successfully developed and gone through validation through animal experiments.
Another BCI system of the company benchmarks against internationally advanced high-throughput flexible microwire electrode technology, and is equipped with large-bandwidth high-speed neural signal acquisition devices and motor imagery decoding algorithms. With a wired version of the system, macaques can agilely intercept a two-dimensional moving cursor with their minds.
The Tianjin University neural engineering team is one of the earliest research groups in China to focus on BCI. Ming Dong, vice president of Tianjin University, told People's Daily that the university's ""Shen Gong"" artificial neural robot series are able to synchronize cortical and muscle activities in active rehabilitation training.
For example, the core components of ""Shen Gong - Shen Jia"", a neuro-regulated mechanical exoskeleton system of ""Shen Gong"" series, has obtained the medical device registration certificate issued by China's National Medical Products Administration, and the system's key technologies have been tested in over 1,000 clinical trials at multiple top-tier hospitals in China.
""China has made significant breakthroughs in the innovation of software, key algorithms, and typical applications in the field of BCI,"" Ming said. However, to expand the use of this technology, it still needs to make continuous exploration and innovation, and test the effectiveness of the technology through practice, Ming added.
