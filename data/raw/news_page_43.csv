Chinese astronauts fix space station power supply after debris hit
 (Xinhua) 14:24, April 24, 2024
JIUQUAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhou-17 crew in China's space station have repaired the core module's solar wings, which had been damaged by space debris, through two spacewalks during the country's first extravehicular maintenance mission, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said Wednesday.
The crew is scheduled to return to Earth on April 30 after completing the in-orbit work handover to the Shenzhou-18 crew.
The repair work highlighted the role of a manned spacecraft in coping with unintended problems in orbit, said Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA at a press conference.
The space station's core module Tianhe had suffered a partial loss of power supply due to the impact of the space debris on the solar wing's power cables, Lin said.
Noting that the space station has executed maneuvers on multiple occasions to evade space debris impacts, Lin said preventive measures were taken to mitigate hazards stemming from the growing human activities in space in recent years.
China has enhanced its capability to precisely forecast the orbits of the space station and small low-orbit targets, optimized the procedures for space collision warning and avoidance, and reduced the false alarm rate by 30 percent, according to Lin.
In the future, the high-definition camera on the space station's robotic arm, along with the extravehicular hand-held cameras of the astronauts, will be used to inspect the space station's extravehicular status and analyze the likelihood and mechanism of small debris impacts.
The Shenzhou-18 crew, scheduled for launch on Thursday, will be tasked with installing space debris protection reinforcements for extravehicular piping, cables and critical equipment during their extravehicular activities, Lin said.
A system for monitoring and locating leaks in the space station's modules has been deployed and a space station pressure emergency response system has been developed, significantly increasing the in-orbit troubleshooting time allowed for astronauts.
China has regularly released orbit parameters on CMSA's official website and established a safety communication mechanism with major space agencies across the world to implement timely information exchange, Lin added.

Science, application projects on China's space station fruitful
 (Xinhua) 14:21, April 24, 2024
JIUQUAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China has carried out more than 130 scientific research and application projects in its orbiting space station, and yielded fruitful achievements, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) announced at a press conference on Wednesday.
More than 300 scientific experiment samples have been brought back from space by manned missions in five batches, said Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA.
Over 500 scientific research institutes at home and abroad have participated in these projects, achieving important results in space life science, space medicine, space material science, and microgravity fluid physics with more than 280 papers published in international first-class journals, Lin said.
These space experiments and scientific research carried out with the returned samples have continued to achieve new results and will produce more important sci-tech and economic benefits through promotion, transformation and application, Lin noted.
In the project on new materials carried out with high temperature scientific experiment cabinet, researchers have for the first time obtained high-quality crystal materials in space, which is difficult to make on the ground. This is imperative for the preparation of high-performance multivariant semiconductor alloys.
Researchers have also used biotechnology experimental cabinet to carry out basic biological research on human osteocyte. The results have provided new solutions for the prevention and treatment of bone diseases including fractures and spinal injury repair, muscular atrophy and metabolic diseases.
Using the space technology basic test cabinet, the researchers carried out the country's first in-orbit test of Stirling thermoelectric conversion, with its comprehensive technical indicators such as thermoelectric conversion efficiency up to the international advanced level. It will lay a good foundation for the application of the new space power system in the future.
The researchers have also conducted space medical experiments, resulting in a number of important innovations.
Large-scale space science experiments and technology tests in China's space station will greatly advance space science, space technology and space applications, and drive the technological progress of related industries, Lin said.
In the future, China will continue to give full play to the advantages of the national space laboratory and produce more high-level results, he added.

AI algorithm maps out detailed carbon emissions for city managers,2024-04-24,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0424/c90000-20160821.html,"Home>>
		
AI algorithm maps out detailed carbon emissions for city managers
 (Xinhua) 10:41, April 24, 2024
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists are using artificial intelligence (AI) tech to accurately map out carbon emissions in big cities. This is an attempt that may help urban managers make more evidence-based plans in fighting global warming.
It is part of China's efforts to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.
The experimental tool of researchers from the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences is a refitted carbon-monitoring vehicle which takes a joy-ride regularly at bustling zones in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
At an experimental day, a white cylinder rose slowly on top of a van to start sensor-enabled carbon emission monitoring in the city. The carbon monitor was synchronizing the collection of carbon dioxide emission concentration on the road.
Different from ordinary carbon monitors, the vehicle was also mounted with panoramic cameras to capture street scenes. The first-hand data was transmitted to a laboratory at AIR in Beijing, where a brand-new deep learning algorithm is being trained.
Driven by the team's deep learning algorithm, those cameras could discern carbon emission and sink sources, such as moving cars, buildings and carbon-fixing vegetation, in real complex scenarios. Then the AI model can produce estimates on the carbon contributions, either positive or negative, of those sources.
""Take a single site as an example. The AI analysis revealed that small cars contribute the most to emissions, followed by trucks,"" said Wang Li, a researcher from AIR. ""The surrounding roads and buildings also contribute to emissions.""
Currently, Shenzhen has six carbon monitoring towers, but that's inadequate to make a detailed emission map and the building of more towers will be costly, making alternative and complementary monitoring methods necessary, said Zhang Yonglin, a research assistant in Wang's team.
It occurred to Zhang, who has a computer science background, that the AI could lend a hand and he developed the algorithm.
""You have at least 100 elements at one single site, and the objects keep changing,"" said Zhang. ""Only AI can calculate viable results via an inverse modeling.""
Now, a total of 650 kilometers drive-around journey has been completed, obtaining more than 100,000 records of street images and road traffic carbon emissions in Shenzhen.
After training, the AI model can produce a high-definition map within a distance of 100 meters and its accuracy for road traffic carbon emission intensity has exceeded 92 percent, according to Zhang.
The model is projected to provide a fine guide for city managers, like what causes a certain block to see higher carbon emissions and possible solutions behind it. That's an elaborate work the remote-sensing carbon satellites and monitoring towers cannot do.
""The results can remind policy-makers to take measures such as increasing efficiency of access in certain road sections, or planting more trees at a block,"" said Zhang.
""Sometimes, too much greenery is not all beneficial for reducing carbon concentration when it results in a pipeline effect,"" he added. ""That's what the AI map can tell you.""
In March, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment set a goal in building a modernized ecological environment monitoring system by 2035 via stepped-up efforts for digital and intelligent upgrading.
New technologies including AI and Internet of Things will be applied to establish an intelligent monitoring system, according to the ministry.

Feature: High-tech equipment drives modern agriculture in northeast China
 (Xinhua) 10:17, April 24, 2024
HARBIN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, the country's largest grain producer, is buzzing with farming activities, with smart agriculture, driven by new technologies and equipment, playing a key role.
In the Longmentong management area of the 290 branch office of Beidahuang Group, one of China's leading agricultural groups, newly-introduced large tractors are parked in orderly rows. Technician Mu Liang is testing the vehicles with his colleagues.
""These are almost the most advanced tractors around here. We have just installed the high-precision autopilot system on these tractors, through which they can run automatically in the field,"" said Mu.
With more than 270 horsepower, the tractors cost nearly 1 million yuan (about 140,728 U.S. dollars) each, and come with automatic production management systems and operation record systems, giving them extremely high operational efficiency, Mu added.
With 700,000 mu (about 46,667 hectares) of arable land, the 290 branch office mainly grows corn, soybeans and wheat. In recent years, the branch office has also introduced unmanned rice transplanters.
According to Mu, the traditional rice transplanter requires at least two people working together to operate. ""Workers need time for rest, but the unmanned rice transplanters can run 24 hours a day, which not only cuts labor costs but also improves the operation efficiency,"" he said.
Apart from modern farm machinery, a weather tracking service has also been provided as guidance for farming activities.
After receiving a gale warning from the farm's meteorological station, grain grower Zhang Zhenbo is busy reinforcing a greenhouse.
According to Xu Kejiang, a staffer at the meteorological station of Beidahuang's 856 branch office, the station employs the QY-3 geostationary meteorological satellite data receiving system, which can generate data distribution maps, outputting meteorological information accurately.
""The meteorological information can be provided throughout the whole chain of agricultural production to assist planting,"" said Xu.
The weather forecast is very accurate and is of great help to farm work, Zhang said. ""From setting up sheds, raising seedlings, sowing, to field management, the weather tracking service can help almost every step of farming activity.""
In recent years, Heilongjiang has continued to introduce advanced agricultural modernization technology in all areas of production, resulting in improved farming efficiency, and laying a solid foundation for the safeguarding of food security.
Heilongjiang has remained China's top grain producer for 14 consecutive years. In 2023, the province produced about 77.88 billion kilograms of grain, accounting for 11.2 percent of the country's total, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

China's Q1 new-energy power generation installation surges; 'overcapacity theory' fake: experts,2024-04-23,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0422/c90000-20159306.html,"Home>>
		
China's Q1 new-energy power generation installation surges; 'overcapacity theory' fake: experts
 (Global Times) 17:02, April 23, 2024
China's installed capacity for power generation from clean-energy sources surged in the first quarter, which analysts attributed to growing domestic demand as China is pursuing high-quality and green development.
Analysts refuted ""overcapacity"" claims hyped recently by some Western countries, noting that such increases in new-energy installations demonstrated China's efforts to fulfill its commitment to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060. The Western hyping of China's ""overcapacity"" is a discourse trap that aims to curb green product exports.
They also noted that from a global perspective, more installed capacity in power generation from clean sources - wind, solar, hydro and other types of new energy - is required to fulfill the green transition worldwide.
According to statistics released by China's National Energy Administration (NEA) on Monday, solar power installations totaled about 660 million kilowatts in the first quarter, increasing by 55 percent year-on-year. Wind power installations grew by 21.5 percent on a yearly basis, amounting to about 460 million kilowatts.
Total installed power generation capacity stood at about 2.99 billion kilowatts as of end-March, up 14.5 percent year-on-year.
As China progresses in its green transformation, the share of renewable energy installations continues to rise, surpassing 50 percent of total power generation capacity as of December 2023, according to the NEA.
Analysts said that although power generated from new-energy sources increased significantly, there is still huge potential for green power generation deployment, primarily aimed at satisfying domestic demand for the green transition.
In the first quarter, China's total electricity use rose to 2.34 trillion kilowatt-hours, up 9.8 percent year-on-year, per NEA statistics.
The rise in installed electricity capacity reflects China's increasing energy demand tied to its economic recovery, Hu Qimu, deputy secretary-general of the digital-real economies integration Forum 50, told the Global Times on Monday. ""As China's economy recovers, the demand for energy will continue to rise.""
China's demand for photovoltaic (PV) products remains strong. There is still room for further growth after years of rapid development, especially in the market for building-integrated PV systems, Feng Chao, general manager of a Zhengzhou-based energy company, told the Global Times on Monday.
In response to Western hyping of ""overcapacity,"" Hu noted that Western countries continue to develop their coal power capacities while setting up trade barriers against Chinese green products, such as PV panels, although they need Chinese products to empower their green transitions.
To combat climate change, resources across the world should be fully mobilized. Globally, green capacity is not excessive, but is actually in dire scarcity. The problem now is not ""overcapacity"" but ""over-anxiety,"" said Xie Feng, Chinese Ambassador to the US, at the opening ceremony of the Harvard Kennedy School China Conference 2024 on Friday, according to the official website of the Chinese Embassy in the US.
The World Economic Forum (WEF) said in February that along with demand-side interventions such as energy efficiency, a rapid and responsible scaling-up of renewables is critical to the transition, aligning with the ambitious target set at COP28 to triple the world's installed renewable energy generation capacity to at least 11,000 gigawatts by 2030.
According to an International Energy Agency report in January, the amount of renewable energy capacity added around the world grew by 50 percent in 2023, reaching almost 510 gigawatts.
That's a gap of 10,490 gigawatts from the WEF's 2030 forecast.
""Calling for a stronger climate response on the one hand but erecting green trade barriers on the other would only raise the costs for one's own low-carbon transition, and also slow down the global development of clean energy,"" Xie stressed.
In a fireside chat with Founding Dean of Harvard Kennedy School Prof. Graham Allison on Friday, Xie also noted that the US is asking China to run barefooted while one wears high-tech track shoes in a race by slapping sanctions on Chinese companies according to its own domestic laws and forcing other countries to ban exports of certain devices and technologies to China.
""Even when barefooted, some top Chinese players, such as producers of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and PV products, have managed to take the lead. The US then accuses them of causing 'overcapacity' and posing a threat to other contestants, demanding they quit the race. This is not fair,"" Xie noted.

Applications of the China's home-developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, or known as the BDS, has played an important role in addressing various challenges during China's 40th Antarctic scientific expedition that just successfully completed earlier in April, Zhang Xiaohong, director of the Chinese Antarctic Center of Surveying and Mapping (CACSM) at the Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Monday.
""Our Antarctic research team of four faculty and student members have just returned from the mission,"" Zhang said during a media event organized by the China National Space Administration, ahead of the upcoming China Space Day.
According to the CACSM director, the main applications of the BDS included monitoring the real-time movement of snow vehicles in high-latitude polar regions, and establishing a continuously operating reference site at Kunlun Station to monitor the dynamic changes of ice bands in real-time.
Moreover, during self-research tasks, snow vehicles need to travel nearly 1,000 kilometers, relying on BDS for navigation. And BDS navigation technology is also used in conducting drone surveys and other tasks at the research base, Zhang revealed.
Zhang highlighted Wuhan University's achievements in Antarctic scientific research, stating that the university has been participating in Antarctic scientific expeditions since 1984, contributing to China's Antarctic scientific endeavors for 40 years.
He emphasized that Antarctica has become part of China's national strategy, serving as a new route for maritime transportation, a new source of resources, and a new frontier for technological competition. Wuhan University and its team at the Hubei Luojia Laboratory play a crucial role in surveying, remote sensing, and navigation technologies research and development, enabling the country to conduct extensive scientific research in Antarctica.
Zhang further pointed out the entire Antarctic is covered by over 14 million square kilometers of ice and snow, making monitoring changes in the Antarctic region crucial. With the accelerating global climate change, the melting of the Antarctic ice cap could lead to a rise in sea levels of approximately 60 meters, which would have far-reaching implications for human survival. To monitor these changes, China must rely on surveying and remote sensing methods. For many years, the team from Wuhan University has been making efforts in this regard and has conducted extensive surveying work in Antarctica
He also mentioned China's establishment of several first-of-their-kind overseas BDS tracking stations in Antarctica, contributing significantly to the construction of the BDS-2 system and ensuring the accuracy of satellite orbits.
China's satellites, including ocean satellites, meteorological satellites, and BDS satellites, play a crucial role in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In the past, China relied on foreign data, but now it can rely on domestically produced satellites, making polar work more independent and controllable. Therefore, in the future, more domestically produced products will play an important role in Arctic and Antarctic regions, Zhang said.

China achieves major breakthroughs in cryogenic refrigeration technology,2024-04-23,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0423/c90000-20160342.html,"Home>>
		
China achieves major breakthroughs in cryogenic refrigeration technology
By Yu Sinan (People's Daily) 14:21, April 23, 2024
Creating an ultra-large cryogenic ""refrigerator"" that provides an ultra-low temperature environment below 20K (minus 253 degrees Celsius) or even down to 2K (minus 271 degrees Celsius), while ensuring continuous and stable operation at hundreds of watts to tens of thousands of watts—this capability has earned large cryogenic refrigeration equipment the title of ""ultra-low temperature factory.""
Scientifically, 20K is known as the liquid hydrogen temperature range, while 2K is the superfluid helium temperature range. Large refrigeration equipment operating in the liquid hydrogen to superfluid helium temperature ranges plays a crucial supporting role in aerospace engineering, hydrogen energy storage and transportation, helium resource development, and the operation of many large scientific installations. For a long time, China had relied almost entirely on imported large cryogenic refrigeration equipment.

After over 10 years of sustained efforts, a research team from the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (TIPC-CAS) has succeeded in developing a series of key and core technologies and launched large-scale cryogenic refrigeration equipment operating from 20K to 2K and from hundreds of watts to kilowatts, enabling the domestic manufacturing of these ""ultra-low temperature factories.""
""Helium gas becomes a liquid at minus 269 degrees Celsius and turns into superfluid helium at minus 271 degrees Celsius. What cools the high-field superconducting magnets in particle accelerators like the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC) is exactly the liquid helium or superfluid helium produced by large cryogenic refrigeration equipment,"" said Hu Zhongjun, a researcher with the TIPC-CAS, in front of a display board for the BEPC at the National Science Library, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Apart from the BEPC, the operation of other large scientific facilities such as the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and the High Energy Photon Source also relies heavily on large cryogenic refrigeration equipment.
Experts believe that China sees an increasingly urgent demand for large cryogenic technology and equipment as it experiences rapid economic and social development. However, to independently develop such equipment is exceptionally difficult.
""Large cryogenic refrigeration equipment is different from common air conditioners or refrigerators,"" said Liu Liqiang, a researcher with the TIPC-CAS, adding that the systems needed are extremely complex.
In 2009, the TIPC-CAS took the lead in conducting research on key core components and system integration for large cryogenic refrigeration systems.
From October 2010 to December 2014, the TIPC-CAS developed China's first domestically produced large cryogenic refrigeration system operating in the liquid hydrogen temperature range with a capacity of 10,000 watts.
In April 2015, a project was launched to develop a large cryogenic refrigeration system from liquid helium to superfluid helium temperature ranges. After more than five years of efforts, the researchers, building on previous achievements, not only independently developed large helium refrigerators with specifications of ""2500W@4.5K"" and ""500W@2K"", but also made a series of breakthroughs in refrigeration technology for liquid helium and superfluid helium temperature ranges, allowing China to join the ranks of internationally advanced nations in this field.
However, simply producing a prototype was not enough, and industrialization was needed to drive the development of upstream and downstream industries.
Given the high applicability of and urgent industrial demand for large cryogenic refrigeration equipment, the TIPC-CAS abandoned the traditional path of commercialization, and creatively explored the application and commercialization of the equipment while it was still in the R&D phase.
Under this model, the equipment has been commercialized exactly when it was fully developed. In 2016, the TIPC-CAS, in collaboration with private capital, set up Beijing Sinoscience Fullcryo Technology Co., Ltd. (Fullcryo).
""Research institutes excel at technology development while enterprises are strong in engineering transformation. The complementary advantages shorten the commercialization cycle and enhance the capability of China's cryogenic industry,"" said Zhang Yanqi, chairman of board of Fullcryo.
It is reported that the implementation of the large cryogenic refrigeration equipment project has driven China to establish a complete chain from R&D, engineering demonstrations to industrial applications in this field.
At the same time, it has boosted the innovation capabilities of related supporting companies, initially forming a comprehensive and clearly divided low-temperature industrial cluster.
Zhang explained that through enterprise-university-research institution collaboration, Fullcryo rapidly grew into a leading enterprise in the cryogenic industry.
Fullcryo was the first in China to develop a series of multi-specification large hydrogen-helium refrigeration equipment and liquefaction systems for the cryogenic temperature range, allowing China to establish itself in the global manufacturing of large cryogenic refrigeration equipment.
Today, more and more major projects are using large cryogenic refrigeration equipment independently developed by China, from superconducting accelerators, to ground testing of spacecraft, and to advanced light sources. China's helium refrigerators and hydrogen liquefiers with hundreds of watts of capacity have been applied in major international scientific projects as well.

Accurate carbon accounting gives leg up to green transition,2024-04-23,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0423/c90000-20160242.html,"Home>>
		
Accurate carbon accounting gives leg up to green transition
By Ji Juesu (People's Daily) 11:27, April 23, 2024
In a plant of Shanghai Baosteel Packaging Co., Ltd. (Baosteel Packaging), machines were working on a beverage can production line, and the carbon consumption of each manufacturing process was shown in real time on a software on the computer of engineer Wang Zhiyou in an office building 15 kilometers away.
According to Wang, the software JIMU LCA Cloud, developed by Shanghai E-C Digital Technology Co., Ltd. (E-C Digital), can also automatically generate carbon footprint reports of products.

""Carbon accounting was both time- and energy-consuming, and the data were not very precise either. This software is easy to use, convenient and efficient,"" Wang said.
E-C Digital is an internet company that focuses on cloud computing for quantifying carbon emissions of industrial manufacturers. Though it has a history of only seven years and its products were sold for only less than three years, the company has already helped many enterprises accurately calculate their carbon emissions.
As green and low-carbon development has become a global consensus, different countries and regions, as well as different industry associations, have put forward their own paths to reduce carbon emissions.
Since China set its ""dual carbon"" goals - reaching the peak of carbon emissions by 2030 and attaining carbon neutrality by 2060 in September 2020, the demand for carbon reduction among Chinese enterprises has grown rapidly in recent years.
The precise quantification of carbon data is a foundational work for enterprises in advancing their green transformation, but its operation is not easy.
To make carbon accounting as simple as ""building blocks,"" E-C Digital went deep into industrial operations, transforming the smallest units, such as equipment units and manufacturing processes into individual ""blocks,"" each of which contains all the relevant data for that process, as well as the logical relationships between the data and between the ""blocks."" This has truly lowered users' access to precise quantification of carbon data.
In terms of corporate carbon accounting, E-C Digital developed the ""JIMU Carbon Cloud"" software, which includes built-in carbon accounting methods and models for 24 industries published by China. For product carbon accounting, the company launched the ""JIMU LCA Cloud,"" which supports the development of multiple national-level, industrial-level carbon data management platforms, and those of leading enterprises. The software interface and operations are simple and clear, which means primary-level engineers can become proficient in using the software.
For years, the can-making business unit of Baosteel Packaging had been hesitant about whether to upgrade the water-ring vacuum pumps on their production lines to screw vacuum pumps. Upgrading the equipment would require significant investment, but the water-ring vacuum pumps had high energy consumption and failure rates.
After introducing E-C Digital's software, the company obtained precise data of energy reduction: screw vacuum pumps could save 1,300 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, and the electricity cost savings would cover the purchase of the new equipment in about a year and a half. With such data support, Baosteel Packaging's equipment upgrade began accelerating in 2022.
Anji, east China's Zhejiang province, is the largest producer of office chairs in China. It is home to a number of small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises. However, establishing a dedicated team of carbon accounting engineers is unaffordable for most of them, and purchasing third-party consulting services is generally expensive and time-consuming in terms of report delivery.
Since 2023, office chairs produced in Anji have come with a ""carbon label"" that showcases the carbon footprint of products' entire lifecycle, which are enabled by E-C Digital.
These carbon labels are developed by E-C Digital in collaboration with the Institute of Service-oriented Manufacturing under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. They aim at helping furniture-related small- and medium-sized enterprises in Anji carry out low-cost, efficient, and standardized carbon accounting, and deliver carbon footprint reports complying with relevant standards.
""Reliable carbon footprint reports make our products more competitive,"" said the head of a furniture company in Anji.
After seven years of development, E-C Digital has grown from a five-person startup team into a high-tech company with over 100 employees. Its business scope has expanded from steel and power to over 30 industries including non-ferrous metals, chemicals, petrochemicals, batteries, and new energy. It provides precise carbon data quantification and overall ""dual carbon"" solutions to over 1,000 clients through a cloud computing model.
""China has a solid industrial foundation and a massive global trade supply chain system, providing extremely broad application scenarios for carbon quantification software. This is our advantage,"" said Zhou Jing, chairman of board of E-C Digital.
E-C Digital has become the first non-European Union (EU) provider of carbon quantification tools recognized by the EU's environmental impact assessment mutual recognition platform.
It is reported that multiple international manufacturing clients have contacted E-C Digital, hoping it can help them address carbon footprint information disclosure requirements for the EU market. ""Our professionalism has gained international recognition,"" said Zhou.

China is celebrating the 30th anniversary of its full access to the internet, marking a period of significant social and economic development driven by the internet.
Over the past three decades, the internet has disrupted traditional economic models, transformed the way people acquire knowledge, enriched leisure and entertainment activities, accelerated production and daily life, and profoundly shaped individuals' perspectives on life, the world, and values, according to Wang Jilong, professor at the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace (INSC), Tsinghua University and co-chair of the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) China Consortium.
A report released by the China Internet Network Information Center revealed that as of December 2023, China's internet user base had reached 1.092 billion people, an increase of 24.8 million compared to the previous year, resulting in an internet penetration rate of 77.5%.
China has also made significant strides in the development of internet infrastructure. By the end of 2023, the country had assigned over 68,000 blocks/32 of IPv6 addresses, registered more than 20 million top-level "".cn"" domain names, and established 1.136 billion broadband access ports. Furthermore, China constructed approximately 3.4 million 5G stations, ensuring coverage in all urban areas of prefecture-level cities and counties.
In addition, Wang emphasized the internet's role in driving the digital economy, noting its increasing integration into various economic sectors. China's digital economy has now surpassed 50 trillion yuan ($6.9 trillion) in scale, propelled by technologies such as the internet, cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, and financial technology.
Wang also highlighted China's commitment to cybersecurity with the establishment of a comprehensive organizational and legal framework. Last year, China released the ""White Paper on China's Law-Based Cyberspace Governance in the New Era,"" showcasing its progress and commitment to promoting the internet's lawful, orderly, and healthy development.
Despite these achievements, Wang acknowledged that there is still significant room for improvement in the development of core cybersecurity technology. He suggested further investment in national public cyberspace security infrastructure to provide internet users with a stable and secure online environment.
Looking to the future, Wang emphasized the importance of original and pioneering internet innovation, particularly as the information technology revolution intensifies. He expressed hope that China can seize the opportunities presented by the latest technological revolution by encouraging more research initiatives and promoting the development of innovative internet technologies.
