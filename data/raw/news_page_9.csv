XI'AN, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- China's homegrown MA60 remote sensing aircraft has enabled scientists to conduct scientific studies via a large aerial platform.
The aircraft has filled the country's blank in terms of large and medium-sized remote sensing aircraft featuring long range, multi-tasking ability, multi-function capability and multi-watch windows, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the country's leading aircraft manufacturer.
The aircraft recently conducted a remote sensing experiment in north China's Luanhe River basin concerning the moisture perspective in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum, thereby providing an advanced technical means for ecological conservation and green development, the AVIC said.
This research was conducted by a joint scientific research team featuring multiple institutions, including the National Space Science Center and Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
Serving as an aeronautic remote sensing system, the aircraft enables scientists to accurately capture the moisture content of vegetation and soil by observing forests, farmland and grassland from a unique aerial view.
A joint project of the CAS and AVIC, the MA60 remote sensing aircraft was developed by AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd. in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province. It is China's new generation, high performance aerial remote sensing platform, and also the country's most comprehensive aerial scientific experiment platform.
""The MA60 remote sensing aircraft and the onboard aerial remote sensing system together make up the Chinese Aeronautic Remote Sensing System, which has the most comprehensive capabilities in China in this field,"" said Ding Yaxiu, chief designer of the MA60 remote sensing aircraft.
Based on the MA60 regional aircraft, the MA60 remote sensing model is an aircraft platform designed for conducting scientific experiments, and offers improved performance and additional installed systems compared with the MA60 regional aircraft.
The MA60 remote sensing aircraft could be installed with dozens of advanced types of equipment and different systems. ""Thus, it can meet mission demands such data collection, recording, processing and transmission,"" Ding explained.
This model is capable of serving scientific studies in many fields, including agricultural and forestry data investigation, geological and mineral exploration, hydrology, environmental monitoring and evaluation, natural disaster relief, and surveying and mapping.
""The MA60 remote sensing aircraft is the aerial platform of the Chinese Aeronautic Remote Sensing System, thanks to its considerable airborne capacity. For Earth observation tasks, it has 18 windows consisting of 7 different types, which allow the use of related payloads,"" said Zhu Jinbiao, deputy director of the Airborne Remote Sensing Center under the AIR.
Compared with satellite remote sensing, aerial remote sensing by aircraft is more flexible in terms of selecting the time, location and means of the observation missions. It also offers unique advantages, namely significant mobility, high resolution, more versatile and flexible load configuration, according to Zhu.
""This aircraft plays an increasingly important role in major national tasks such as scientific research, as well as emergency rescue and disaster reduction efforts,"" he added.
Currently, two MA60 remote sensing aircraft have been put into operation and they have made remarkable achievements in fields such as agriculture, disaster relief, Qinghai-Xizang Plateau scientific research, and more.
In 2023, MA60 remote sensing aircraft undertook 15 national tasks, including the Yellow River Delta land-and-sea ecological monitoring experiment, the monitoring and protection of world heritage sites, and the acquisition of high-precision digital images based on the BeiDou spatio-temporal benchmark.
These aircraft have also been widely used in conducting research related to the likes of the ecological environment, natural resources and land mapping, according to Zhu.
""Looking ahead, the MA60 remote sensing aircraft will continue to serve Chinese scientists in carrying out scientific exploration and building an aerial remote sensing technical system serving major national tasks,"" Zhu said.

Asteroid 2024 RW1 has, by entering the Earth's atmosphere and burning out 25 kilometers above the Philippines on Sept 5, the day China announced its asteroid defense plan, proved the necessity and practicality of the plan.
It's true that the risks of an asteroid causing damage are considerably low, as most of them burn out moments after entering the atmosphere. However, should an asteroid make landfall the disaster might be more than mankind can bear.
After all, the impact of an asteroid on the Gulf of Mexico about 65 million years ago is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs. More recently, in 1908, an asteroid that landed in Tunguska in Siberia triggered a forest fire that damaged about 80 million trees within a 2,000 square-km radius.
Before the advent of modern technology, there was no way to know which asteroids were dangerous or how to shield ourselves from them even if we knew. However, with the help of new advanced telescopes and advances in telecommunications, it's now possible to keep an alert eye on space to safeguard ourselves from possible dangers.
Even the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration is prepared for challenges from out there. In September 2022, it launched the Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission, under which a spacecraft was made to collide with asteroid moonlet Dimorphos in order to deflect its course. The European Space Agency's Hera mission, starting in October, will study the binary asteroid system Didymos, and the DART's impact on Dimorphos.
To defend the Earth from nearby asteroids, China will reportedly adopt an “escort plus impact plus escort” mode, which is interpreted by some as a combination of what NASA and ESA have been doing, namely to both impact and observe.
China joined the International Asteroid Warning Network in 2018 and was monitoring the asteroid that entered the skies over the Philippines. China, with its more advanced technologies, is willing to join hands with its friends around the world to defend the Earth from asteroids.

The 2024 World Robot Conference was recently held in Beijing. Nearly 170 Chinese and foreign robot enterprises joined the 2024 World Robot Expo, part of the World Robot Conference, unveiling more than 600 innovative products, including 27 humanoid robots.
In recent years, the Chinese robot industry has experienced rapid growth, integrating deeply into people's daily work and life. China has become the world's largest market and producer of robots.
Recently, humanoid robot Walker S Lite developed by UBTECH Robotics Corp., Ltd., a leading robotics firm based in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, completed training at the 5G smart factory of Chinese electric vehicle brand Zeekr in Ningbo, east China's Zhejiang province, after working three weeks alongside its human counterparts. With a maximum load of 15 kilograms, it can assist workers in carrying work bins.
According to Zhao Chunlin, head of the 5G smart factory, Walker S Lite has become the first humanoid robot in China to perform the entire process of moving cargo boxes, showcasing exceptional task completion and difficulty levels that ranked at the forefront of the industry.
To meet the growing individualized demands, the Chinese manufacturing industry is transitioning from high automation to comprehensive intelligentization.
""Humanoid robots enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) possess multimodal perception and autonomous decision-making capabilities. They have a competitive advantage when facing complex and changing work environments, showing great potential and broad prospects in intelligent manufacturing,"" Zhao noted.

According to the latest statistics from China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the country's newly added robot installations accounted for more than half of the global market over the past three years, and the number of robots per 10,000 workers in China's manufacturing sector reached 470, surging 19 fold in the past decade.
Service robots have been widely applied in areas such as family services and medical care, while specialized robots play a crucial role in areas such as air and sea exploration and emergency rescue.
Apart from the growing size, China's robot industry has seen a continuous increase in technological capabilities, marked by constant breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies such as multi-sensor fusion perception and natural human-machine interaction, increasingly sophisticated key components like reducers, controllers, and servo systems, and enhanced performance and safety levels of industrial robots engaged in welding and spraying and service robots for surgery and logistics. As of July 2024, China boasted over 190,000 effective robot-related patents, accounting for about two-thirds of the global total.
At the same time, governance and regulation of China's robot industry are becoming increasingly comprehensive. The Chinese government has implemented effective policies and measures, such as a development plan for the robotics industry, a ""Robot +"" action plan, and industry norms for industrial robots.
China has participated in the revision of 26 international robot standards, established the World Robot Cooperation Organization, issued the Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance, and promoted international cooperation in robot ethics research, regulation and governance.
At the opening ceremony of the 2024 World Robot Conference, the upgraded TianGong 1.2MAX humanoid robot was unveiled by the Beijing Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robotics Innovation Center, China's first innovation center focused on core technologies, product development and application ecosystems for humanoid robots.
Standing 173 centimeters tall and weighing 60 kilograms, the robot featured 42 degrees of freedom. It carried the emblem of the conference and placed it precisely on a launch pad in the center of the stage. This marked the first time that a humanoid robot demonstrated long-range task capabilities.
""TianGong 1.2MAX is equipped with multiple visual perception sensors, six-dimensional force sensors, an inertial measurement unit, and 3D vision sensors, which allow it to perform 550 trillion calculations per second,"" said Xiong Youjun, the center's general manager.
Twenty-seven humanoid robots made their debut at the 2024 World Robot Conference, attracting considerable attention. When will these products be available for mass production?
""The humanoid robot G1, launched in May this year with a starting price of 99,000 yuan ($13,922), is close to completing the design modifications for mass production, and is expected to be mass-produced by the end of the year,"" said Wang Xingxing, founder, chief executive officer, and chief financial officer of Unitree Robotics, a Hangzhou-based robotics startup.
The application of large language models and multimodal models is accelerating the evolution of humanoid robots, but a general-purpose large model is necessary for these robots to be integrated into industrial and services sectors, Wang explained. ""I am optimistic and believe that this time frame will not exceed 5 years.""
""If we follow the order of development, the primary areas where humanoid robots may be first deployed are production lines and special positions such as inspection and maintenance, followed by household chores, elderly care, and other services scenarios,"" said Ren Lei, co-founder of a Chinese humanoid robot developer and a professor at Jilin University.
Wang He, assistant professor in the Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies (CFCS) at Peking University (PKU) and head of PKU-Galbot Joint Lab of Embodied AI, predicted that the ability of humanoid robots to grasp, position, and move can be utilized in multiple scenarios such as factories, retail, and services sector, with the potential to achieve rapid growth from hundreds to thousands of units in the next two years. ""In the next 15 years, humanoid robots will definitely grow into a trillion-yuan market,"" he said.

Chinese researchers identify bacterial therapy potentially effective in colorectal cancer prevention, treatment
 (Xinhua) 13:41, September 10, 2024
LANZHOU, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Bacterial therapy could offer a promising new method for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, according to a study carried out by Chinese researchers.
The recent study conducted by the School of Life Sciences at Lanzhou University in northwest China's Gansu Province, has revealed that the probiotic limosilactobacillus fermentum GR-3, derived from ""Jiangshui,"" a traditional fermented food in northwestern China, demonstrates potential for promoting apoptosis in colon tumor cells and inhibiting their proliferation.
Professor Li Xiangkai, head of the research group and a professor at the university's School of Life Sciences, explained that studies have shown that colorectal cancer patients often experience an imbalance in their gut microbiota and a persistent state of peroxidation in tumor cells. Unlike conventional antioxidants, probiotics like Lactobacillus GR-3 could specifically target the tumor microenvironment while also regulating intestinal flora.
Li's team successfully isolated Lactobacillus GR-3, a strain with strong antioxidant properties. In both hyperuricemia mouse models and clinical trials, this strain has shown promise in promoting uric acid degradation by modulating the gut microbiome. Building on these findings, the research team explored the potential of Lactobacillus GR-3 in preventing colorectal cancer through its effects on gut flora and the host immune system.
The results showed that Lactobacillus GR-3 significantly reduced the growth of colon tumors in drug-induced mice and demonstrated positive therapeutic effects. The strain not only lowered tumor mass but also improved the composition of intestinal microbial metabolites, promoted apoptosis in colon cancer cells, and inhibited their proliferation.
The research team will conduct further studies to investigate the specific mechanisms of action of Lactobacillus GR-3 and evaluate its clinical efficacy.
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in China. While existing research primarily focuses on how probiotics regulate the host immune system, there has been comparatively little exploration of their antioxidant properties and ability to modulate gut microbiota.
""Our study aims to identify probiotics with strong antioxidant capacity and robust gut flora regulatory effects, providing new insights into the prevention and inhibition of colorectal cancer,"" said Li.

Returned lunar glass beads indicate moon still alive 120 million years ago,2024-09-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0910/c90000-20217143.html,"Home>>
		
Returned lunar glass beads indicate moon still alive 120 million years ago
 (Xinhua) 09:59, September 10, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- A collection of glass beads retrieved by China's Chang'e-5 lunar mission revealed that the moon might have been geologically active as recently as 120 million years ago.
Lunar samples obtained prior to the mission indicated that the moon's volcanic activities had ceased approximately 3 billion years ago, suggesting it had become a ""dead planet."" However, the basaltic rock fragments returned by Chang'e-5 suggest a more recent period of volcanic activity, dating back to just 2 billion years ago.
A new study has revealed that three volcanic glass beads, which are supposed to be the products of rapid cooling of volcanic magma, formed only about 123 million years ago and were subsequently transported to the Chang'e-5 landing site.
The lunar molten rocks enriched with volatiles experience a decrease in pressure as they ascend. This causes the volatiles to escape as gases, forming a gas reservoir above the underground magma, according to a study published in the journal Science last week.
Then, a small amount of magma forms aerosol and suspended particles within the gas reservoir, which are finally ejected explosively onto the lunar surface to translate into small volcanic glass beads.
The researchers from the Institute of Geology and Geophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences investigated approximately 3,000 glass beads in returned lunar soil samples, and identified three as having a volcanic origin on the basis of their textures, chemical compositions, and sulfur isotopes.
Radiometric dating of the three volcanic glass beads has determined their ages, and pointed to volcanism at that time, according to the study.
The team also identified high abundances of rare earth elements and thorium in these glass beads, indicating that such recent volcanism was related to local enrichment of heat-generating elements in the mantle sources of the magma.
These findings have sparked new questions in lunar research, including the origin of these youthful volcanic glass beads, and have led to speculation about the potential existence of even more recent lunar volcanic activities.
The Chang'e-5 probe, which returned to Earth on Dec. 17, 2020, retrieved 1,731 grams of lunar samples, consisting primarily of rocks and soil from the lunar surface.
Through analysis of those lunar samples, significant strides have been made, yielding over 80 publications in scientific journals. Among the findings are the identification of the ""youngest"" basalt on the moon, the discovery of a new lunar mineral and a kind of mineral that harbors water molecules.
This year, China's Chang'e-6 mission achieved a historic first by collecting 1,935.3 grams of lunar samples from the far side of the moon. This endeavor is also of unique scientific significance and expected to substantially advance people's understanding of the moon's evolutionary history.

QINGDAO, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- A collaborative team of scientists from China, Britain, and Denmark has constructed a comprehensive global marine microbiome database, demonstrating the potential of marine microorganisms for marine science research and biotechnological and biomedical applications.
The research team, led by BGI-Research, spent five years reanalyzing nearly 240 terabytes of publicly available marine metagenomic data and built a database containing 43,191 metagenome-assembled genomes and 2.46 billion gene sequences. More than 20,000 of these genomes were identified as potential novel species.
The study was recently published in the journal Nature.
This database contains information on marine ecosystems ranging from the Antarctic to the Arctic, from coastal areas to the open ocean, and from the ocean's surface to the 10,000-meter deep hadal zone.
""This study significantly enhances our understanding of the diversity of marine microorganisms, including marine archaea and bacteria,"" said Fan Guangyi, director of BGI-Research, Qingdao.
Fan added that the study has analyzed the biogeographical distribution patterns of global marine microbial communities, providing new insights into how these microorganisms are distributed across different environments.
The research team also uncovered three new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic-degrading enzymes, one of which can degrade PET plastic film within three days, with the degradation rate reaching 83 percent.
""One gram of this enzyme can degrade 55 plastic water bottles of 500 milliliters each,"" said Li Shengying, co-corresponding author of the study.
""This advancement will play a positive role in addressing plastic pollution, particularly in achieving green, low-carbon, and sustainable use of PET plastics in China,"" Li said. ""It will also help reduce the reliance of the plastic manufacturing industry on petroleum and lower its carbon emissions.""
Earlier research has revealed the tremendous potential of marine microbial diversity in exploring novel gene editing systems, antimicrobial peptides, and other microbial functions.
In this study, the research team explored the database's genetic resources from multiple dimensions, identifying 36 new gene editing systems.
Researchers investigated the application potential of one of these systems, which has proven highly effective for genome editing in all testing scenarios. This highlights its potential as a new tool for basic research and translational medicine development.
In addition, 117 potential new antimicrobial peptides were identified, among which 10 showed notable antimicrobial activity and broad-spectrum efficacy after biosynthesis and testing. This offers a promising new approach to tackling antibiotic resistance.
""Antimicrobial peptides are likely to be employed for the development of entirely new antibiotics or other drugs in the future,"" Li said.
Building on these results, BGI-Research has partnered with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to establish a joint research center for further development and commercialization.

New firmoss species discovered in SW China with potentials to treat Alzheimer
 (Xinhua) 08:41, September 10, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have discovered a new firmoss species in southwest China, an extract of which has been proved to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
The new species, which is later named Huperzia crassifolia, was discovered during a medical plant inventory research in southwest China's Guizhou Province, according to a CAS press release.
Liu Hongmei, an XTBG associate researcher, a member of the research team said that Huperzia, also commonly known as firmoss, has about 25 species and mainly grows in temperate and boreal climatic zones.
The newly-discovered Huperzia crassifolia is a terrestrial firmoss. It resembles other Huperzia species' gross morphology, but can be easily distinguished by its thicker texture and round-lanceolate pinnae, Liu told Xinhua on Monday.
According to Liu, Huperzine A, a substance found in firmoss plants has been proved to be very effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
The new species is only known to grow in Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan and Chongqing in China, and it often roots in the humus rich soils in broad leaf forests at an altitude from 1,100 to 1,900 meters above sea level with a very small population at each locality, said Liu.
""If people know its medicinal value, Huperzia crassifolia may be in danger of being over-collected. We tentatively propose its conservation status as Endangered (EN) according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories and criteria,"" said Liu.
The findings have been published in the scientific journal PhytoKeys.

BEIJING, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed the world's first original biopesticide molecule targeting chitin biological processes, making a significant advancement in the green development of the pesticide industry.
The newly developed fungal chitin deacetylase inhibitors exhibit high efficiency, excellent biosafety and environmental friendliness. These inhibitors are highly effective in preventing and controlling various major crop fungal diseases, said Yang Qing, a professor with the Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).
The innovative molecule is a major scientific achievement resulting from years of research led by Yang on the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis, assembly, degradation, and modification of chitin.
Chitin is the most abundant aminopolysaccharide on earth, and its biosynthesis is essential for the survival and reproduction of numerous organisms, including pests, pathogenic fungi, and oomycetes that severely impact crop production. Importantly, chitin is absent in plants and mammals, making it an ideal molecular target for the development of green fungicides or insecticides.
The industrialization of this innovation has been a collaborative endeavor between the Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS and Hebei Zhongbao Green Crop Technology Co., Ltd.
Significant progress have been achieved, including the formal naming of the new molecule by the National Pesticide Standardization Technical Committee, the sealing of original active ingredient and pesticide formulations, and the establishment of enterprise standards.
""The transition from original theoretical innovation to the industrialization of pesticide production represents a significant milestone, providing critical insights into molecular target structures that are essential for the development of green pesticides,"" said Qian Xuhong, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of East China Normal University.
""Professor Yang's team has devoted over a decade to chitin-related biological research, successfully closing the loop from the molecular target discovery to the creation of novel pesticide molecules, setting a valuable precedent for the development of new pesticides,"" added Qian.

BEIJING, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Francina Lerato Kuwali, a 35-year-old international student from Malawi at China Agricultural University (CAU), returned recently with the exciting news that she and her classmates had helped local farmers in her country achieve a maize yield of 9,000 kg per hectare, nearly three times the local average.
Over the past year, they have applied the agricultural techniques learned at CAU to assist 30 farmers in Malawi with maize cultivation, as part of the cultivation plan under the cooperative postgraduate education program called ""China-Africa Science and Technology Backyard.""
Launched in 2019, the program is being implemented by the CAU in both China and Africa. It aims to foster high-quality agricultural talent in African countries through agricultural practice and technical exchanges, leveraging China's experience to support Africa's agricultural development.
Supported by institutions such as the World Bank, the Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the program draws master's students in agriculture from Africa, including exceptional faculty and students from partner institutions, young professionals from government, and technical managers from the agricultural industry.
Agriculture is the backbone of Malawi's economy. At the same time, the biggest challenge lies in low yields and unaffordable machinery or fertilizers, said Kuwali, who works as an agricultural extension worker and came to CAU in 2022, in the belief that she might learn from China's excellent experience in the area.
Given the similarities between African and Chinese agricultural production, such as the dominance of smallholder farmers and relatively low productivity levels, the program aims to explore and develop a new talent cultivation model for China-Africa agricultural cooperation, according to Jiao Xiaoqiang, head of the program and an associate professor at the CAU's college of resources and environmental sciences.
""Our main goal is to create a model that can be shared in Africa, helping local farmers acquire, understand and apply technology, and to explore a new path for the green transformation of African agriculture and food security,"" he said.
Notably, the program has proved pragmatic and effective, following a tailored training plan. Students spend the first year in China learning theory and practical skills, the second year applying Chinese agricultural techniques in Africa, and the third year back in China completing their research and thesis.
Since its establishment, the sci-tech backyard program has recruited 91 practice-oriented agricultural talents focused on green agricultural development across 12 African countries. So far, 36 of them have completed their studies, and many graduates have returned to Africa to conduct research on the front lines of agricultural production in their home countries.
CAU, in collaboration with domestic partners, has established seven sci-tech backyards in countries such as Zambia, Tanzania and Malawi.
The deepening Sino-African agriculture cooperation has not only enhanced crop production but also helped achieve several broader goals in Africa, including advancing agricultural technology, improving nutrition and health, and contributing to poverty-reduction efforts.
In 2021, the CAU, in collaboration with the local government of the Morogoro Region in Tanzania, started an agricultural project called ""Small Beans, Big Nutrition.""
By introducing the maize-soybean intercropping technique and methods for making soy products to local villagers, the project aims to supplement the local diet to improve the nutrition levels of women and children in the region.
Maize is a staple food in Tanzania, but it lacks essential nutrients needed for human growth, such as proteins, vitamins, tryptophan, and lysine. Data shows that in 2023, 30 percent of Tanzanian children under five suffered from stunted growth.
Soybeans are high in protein and rich in vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds, making them a suitable choice for nutritional supplements for the local population.
Therefore, soy milk -- a new addition to the local diet -- is gaining popularity among villagers in Morogoro, especially after project members have demonstrated how to make it using soy milk makers purchased locally.
""Soy milk is nice, especially for children to improve their health, and the project should reach as many people as possible,"" said Rozalia Grayson Rwegasira, an official from the Morogoro regional commissioner's office.
Smallholder farmers in Africa are eager for technological advancements and environmentally friendly solutions from Chinese agricultural research institutions to enhance their resilience against natural disasters caused by global climate change, according to Prasanna Boddupalli, director of the global maize program under International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center.
From the perspective of Tamani Nkhono Mvula, a Malawian agriculture expert, one of the biggest gaps in African agricultural development is the issue of agricultural research and development, while the increase in productivity largely comes from investment in science and technology.
The deepening agricultural cooperation in local communities, exemplified by the sci-tech backyards, has not only boosted those technologies that are tailor-made for various challenges, including plant diseases, insect pests and climate damages, but also helped cultivate the capabilities of African residents regarding sci-tech innovation.
""In recent years, we have trained a group of high-quality professionals who understand agriculture, love rural areas and care about farmers in Africa. Through them, advanced Chinese agricultural technology has been implemented in Africa, enhancing the spontaneous development capacity of local farmers, and helping them increase food production and incomes,"" said Jiao, head of the backyard program.

The latest defense operation against a potential asteroid impact reflects China's ability to quickly initiate relay tracking observations thanks to its deployment of widespread observation stations across the country and advanced network monitoring technologies, Chinese experts involved in the tracking task told the Global Times on Sunday, noting that international cooperation is crucial in dealing with such emergency situations.
On early Thursday, a small asteroid approximately 1.2 meters in diameter entered the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of approximately 20 kilometers per second and exploded at an altitude of about 25 kilometers northeast of the Philippines.
It was the first time that China's monitoring network has conducted relay tracking observations for an asteroid warning, and also the ninth asteroid that humankind has ever spotted before impact, according to media reports. It marked significant progress in China's asteroid defense efforts, Science and Technology Daily reported on Saturday.
The asteroid, named 2024 RW1, was first discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) at 1:43 pm Beijing time on Wednesday and at 8 pm, a near-Earth telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory started tracking the asteroid's trajectory. Meanwhile, telescopes located at the Ngari Prefecture in Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region joined the tracking, providing ephemeris guidance for radar observations, Zhao Haibin, a researcher at the Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times.
China's ability to quickly initiate the relay observation benefited from the deployment of observation stations across various time zones, providing a relatively comprehensive relay tracking capability, Zhao said. Also, by leveraging the advantages of networked monitoring equipment, scientists were able to conduct position forecasting, tracking, and data processing, he added.
The successful handling of impact this time was the result of joint global actions by observatories in the US, Chile, and Australia together with China, Zhao said, ""The recent series of success in early warning and avoidance against asteroid impact cannot be done without joint efforts by global participants.""
China joined the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) in 2018, an organization that aims to strengthen global cooperation and data sharing in the field of near-Earth object observation and response to potential impact threats.

"Turtle, bird, dinosaur tracks reveal NW China's Cretaceous past",2024-09-09,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0909/c90000-20216572.html,"Home>>
		
Turtle, bird, dinosaur tracks reveal NW China's Cretaceous past

LANZHOU, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- A scientific research team on Saturday revealed the discovery of fossilized tracks left by prehistoric creatures in northwest China dating back hundreds of millions of years, including tracks left by birds, turtles and dinosaurs.
The fossils were buried in red sandstone dating back to the Lower Cretaceous period in Yongjing County of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province.
Between 2020 and 2022, staff from a dinosaur museum in a local Yellow River scenic area discovered a trove of six track sites. Five sites were attributed to ancient birds, including one containing turtle tracks, and another was attributed to theropod dinosaurs.
The findings of the study have been published in the journal Cretaceous Research, with scientists highlighting that the fossils have provided China's first evidence of turtle tracks, as well as evidence of the coexistence of turtles and birds.
According to co-author Li Daqing, a professor specializing in paleontology at Gansu Agricultural University, Yongjing is a renowned fossil site where scientists have unearthed numerous well-preserved dinosaur bones, footprints and other important early Cretaceous fossils dating back 145 million years.
This time, the research team discovered pairs of small and medium-sized turtle tracks that could be identified as the first exact ancient turtle tracks found in China, and they had better preservation levels and regularity than previous discoveries.
Lead researcher Xing Lida, a paleontologist at the China University of Geosciences, suggested the tracks could have been made by turtles walking along the bottom of shallow waters or swimming in them. Moreover, it was observed that some of the turtle tracks were covered by bird tracks, indicating that the tracks left by turtles were formed before those left by birds.
""This provides a vivid depiction of an ancient ecological scene: turtles moved through shallow waters, leaving their footprints. As the water level receded, the area was exposed, attracting a large number of birds to feed. Their tracks consequently intertwined with those left by the turtles,"" Xing said.

In the study, the bird tracks measure approximately 3 centimeters to 4 centimeters in length, resembling the tracks of the Koreanaornis lii, a previously discovered common bird species that lived during the Cretaceous period in China.
The only track site that did not contain bird tracks was that of a symmetrical, three-toed footprint measuring 16.6 centimeters in length, which, based on its morphological characteristics, would have been made by a smaller ankylopollexian, a dinosaur clade.
The study revealed that during the era dominated by dinosaurs, four-legged animals adapted to different water depths based on their size. This finding could assist scientists in determining and categorizing ancient water depths, according to Xing.
""Moreover, it contributes to our understanding of the dinosaur fauna in Yongjing during the early Cretaceous period and offers valuable materials for the study of the area's ancient ecosystems,"" Xing added.
Since the late 1990s, more than 2,000 dinosaur footprints have been discovered in the region. It has recently gained media attention due to its continuous findings of dinosaur fossils.

In early August, Xing's team unveiled a collection of five small fossilized dinosaur footprints from the Cretaceous period found in the autonomous prefecture, believed to be among the smallest known dinosaur tracks worldwide.
The curator of the local dinosaur museum, You Wenze, who was also named among those who found the latest fossilized tracks, said that these discoveries have expanded the collection of dinosaur footprints and boosted the area's culture and tourism value.

Private satellite network launches first global communication services
By Zhang Yiyi (Global Times) 08:49, September 09, 2024
As a Chinese commercial aerospace company on Friday provided, for the first time, global low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication services, experts said on Sunday that the launch of China's private satellite network for global communications demonstrates the country's advancing telecom capabilities, with private companies now positioned to compete globally.
The third orbital plane of Chinese private automaker Geely's Future Mobility Constellation was launched on Friday from Taiyuan, North China's Shanxi Province, with 10 satellites entering their intended orbits and functioning normally.
The launch brought Geely's Future Mobility Constellation to 30 satellites, covering 90 percent of the world with near-constant communication. This marks the first time a Chinese commercial aerospace company has provided global LEO satellite communication services.
China's commercial space industry is picking up speed, with several satellite constellation projects taking off this year.
On August 6, the first batch of satellites from the Qianfan Constellation was launched, with plans to achieve global network coverage by the end of 2027.
In May, LandSpace subsidiary Hongqing Technology filed a frequency and orbit request for its Honghu Constellation, aiming to deploy 10,000 satellites across 160 orbital planes.
Despite a late start, China is rapidly advancing in building satellite constellations, particularly in the commercial sector, and catching up with global competitors, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Sunday.
""For example, orbital insertion technology has matured, and rocket reliability continues to improve. Commercial space companies are key to driving market growth by delivering tailored, efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet market demand,"" Wang noted.
Whether China's LEO satellite development can truly lead globally still depends on market testing and adjustments for a period of time, Wang said.
LEO satellite networks are a necessary step toward the 6G era, Wang noted.
""Both state-owned and private Chinese companies, including telecom operators, satellite firms and manufacturers, are actively participating, creating a dynamic and competitive ecosystem,"" Wang said.

"Boeing's Starliner returns to Earth, leaving 2 astronauts behind in space",2024-09-07,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0907/c90000-20216417.html,"Home>>
		
Boeing's Starliner returns to Earth, leaving 2 astronauts behind in space
By Tan Jingjing (Xinhua) 14:55, September 07, 2024
NEW YORK, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Boeing's Starliner spacecraft landed at the U.S. state of New Mexico early Saturday after a journey of approximately six hours from the International Space Station (ISS), with no astronauts on board, as two astronauts were forced to remain in space until next year due to a technical malfunction.
The uncrewed spacecraft autonomously detached from the ISS at approximately 6:04 p.m. Eastern Time (1004 GMT) on Friday and landed at New Mexico's White Sands Space Harbor at approximately 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (1601 GMT) on Saturday, completing its first human spaceflight mission.
NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were aboard the Starliner spacecraft from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on June 5 and arrived at the ISS on June 6.
During Starliner's approach to the orbiting laboratory, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and faced issues with the spacecraft's reaction control thrusters.
Initially, the astronaut duo was scheduled to stay at the ISS for eight days. However, they have already spent three months in space due to technical complications.
NASA ultimately decided that sending the two astronauts home on Starliner was too risky. The new plan is to have the two astronauts ride home on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft in February 2025, and have Starliner return to Earth uncrewed.
The decision to return the Starliner spacecraft without crew marks a significant setback for Boeing, following years of delays that have already pushed its first crewed flight nearly four years behind schedule.
Both Boeing and SpaceX were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts from NASA in 2014 to transport astronauts to replace the agency's space shuttle fleet, which retired in 2011.
While SpaceX successfully began ferrying NASA astronauts to the ISS in 2020, Boeing has faced repeated mechanical and software issues with its Starliner spacecraft, delaying its inaugural crewed mission until June of this year.
NASA had previously indicated that this mission could be the final hurdle before certifying Starliner for regular use. It remains unclear how the technical problems encountered during the mission would affect Starliner program.
