XINING, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have cloned two live Tibetan goats from adult goats body cells in northwest China's Qinghai Province, in an effort to prevent the plateau livestock breed from degenerating.
Under the program led by a research team of the Northwest A&F University, three rams and one ewe were used as cell donors for the clones.
""Two cloned goats have been born in Qinghai. The first-born weighed 3.4 kg and is healthy,"" said Su Jianmin, the chief scientist leading the cloning program, adding that the cloning research made in Qinghai can help the breed sustain its adaptivity to the plateau environment after birth.
Ma Yuehui, a researcher at the Institute of Animal Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that the cloning in the plateau environment is a major breakthrough in the field of Tibetan goat breeding technology, and of great significance for the improvement of the quality and efficiency of the Tibetan goat breeding industry.
Tibetan goat is an important cash livestock in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Su's team has been working with the Xining municipal animal disease prevention and control center since 2018 to carry out the embryo engineering application technology research on Tibetan yak and goat.
Zhang Chengtu, a researcher from the center, said the research program will help promote the good varieties of Tibetan goats and boost the income of farmers and herdsmen.

China plans to carry out about 100 space launch missions this year, making it a very busy time for the nation's space industry.
The record-setting launch schedule was unveiled on Monday by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, a state-owned conglomerate and the nation's leading space contractor, at a news conference in Beijing.
The company will be responsible for nearly 70 of the planned missions, deploying over 290 spacecraft into orbit, said Ma Tao, deputy head of its space program planning department.
Notable spaceflights for the year will include two crewed journeys and two cargo missions to the Tiangong space station, the Chang'e 6 robotic expedition to the moon's far side, and the maiden flights of the Long March 6C and Long March 12 carrier rockets.
Experts said the year's most significant launch will be the Chang'e 6 expedition, tasked with bringing back the first samples from the little-known lunar far side.
""If everything goes according to plan, the spacecraft will touch down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, and collect dust and rock samples from there,"" Ma said.
The United States, the former Soviet Union and China have brought lunar samples back to Earth, but none of these countries have ever obtained samples from the moon's far side, most of which is never visible from Earth.
Ma said the space contractor will launch several state-of-the-art spacecraft this year, ranging from a satellite dedicated to monitoring ocean salinity to an astronomical satellite jointly made by Chinese and French scientists.
The majority of the planned launches will be conducted by the state-owned company's Long March rocket family, with additional launches by its secondary rocket series called Smart Dragon, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp's Kuaizhou fleet, and several models from private companies.
Ma said the nation's leading space contractor will also continue its efforts in the research, development and construction of over 200 spacecraft to be launched in the coming years. They include a new-generation crewed spaceship, the Chang'e 7 lunar probe, the Tianwen 2 asteroid explorer and several advanced satellites.
The company will build more than 230 rockets in 2024, which will be used this year and in the coming years, he added.
Last year, China ranked second globally in terms of launch numbers. It carried out 67 rocket launches, with 47 involving the Long March family, all of which were successful.
Besides state-owned contractors, private enterprises have become a new power in China's rocket industry, with their growth being fast-tracked. Twelve rockets built by Chinese private companies were used last year to send satellites into space, far more than in previous years.

"Chinese observatory's new discovery, a step closer to solving cosmic ray enigma",2024-02-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0226/c90000-20137346.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese observatory's new discovery, a step closer to solving cosmic ray enigma
 (Xinhua) 15:12, February 26, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- China's cosmic ray observatory has discovered a giant ultra-high-energy gamma-ray bubble structure, about ten million times larger than our solar system, in the Cygnus star-forming region, around 5,000 light years from Earth.
Based on the observations made by China's Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), scientists identified that star-forming region as one source of the cosmic rays in the Milky Way with an energy level higher than 10 peta-electron volts (quadrillion electron volts or PeV), about 1,000 times more than the record high achieved by any manmade accelerator on Earth.
""This is the first super cosmic ray accelerator identified as of now. With increasing observation time, LHAASO is expected to detect more super cosmic ray accelerators, and hopefully solve the mystery behind the origins of cosmic rays in the Milky Way,"" said Cao Zhen, principal investigator of LHAASO and an academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
The discovery was published in the academic journal Science Bulletin on Monday.
Cosmic rays are charged particles from outer space, mainly composed of protons. The origin of cosmic rays is one of the most important frontier issues in modern astrophysics.
Measurements of cosmic rays in past decades have revealed a break around 1 PeV in the energy spectrum, which is called the ""knee"" of the cosmic ray energy spectrum due to its shape resembling a knee joint. However, the origin of cosmic rays in the ""knee"" region is still an unsolved mystery and one of the most intriguing topics in cosmic ray research in recent years, said Cao.
LHAASO has discovered a giant ultra-high-energy gamma-ray bubble structure in the Cygnus star-forming region, with multiple photons exceeding 1 PeV inside the structure, with the highest energy reaching 2.5 PeV, said Yang Ruizhi, a key member of the research team.
That discovery indicates the presence of a super cosmic ray accelerator inside the bubble, which continuously accelerates high-energy cosmic ray particles with energies of up to 20 PeV and injects them into interstellar space. These high-energy cosmic rays collide with interstellar gas and produce gamma rays, Yang said.
The massive star cluster, Cygnus OB2, composed of many young, hot, massive stars, near the center of the bubble is the most promising candidate for the super cosmic ray accelerator, Yang said.
The radiation luminosity of these stars is hundreds to millions of times that of the Sun, and the huge radiation pressure blows away the surface material of the stars, forming dynamic stellar winds with speeds up to thousands of kilometers per second. The collision of stellar winds with the surrounding interstellar medium and the violent collision between stellar winds have created ideal sites for efficient particle acceleration, he explained.
""We are looking forward to finding more similar cosmic ray sources through more observation to truly understand the mechanisms that can accelerate cosmic ray particles to such high energy, and to solve the century-long enigma of the origin of cosmic rays,"" said Cao.
LHAASO, located at an altitude of 4,410 meters on Mount Haizi in Daocheng County, southwest China's Sichuan Province, is China's national key scientific and technological infrastructure focusing on cosmic ray research.
The observatory, which is the most sensitive ultra-high-energy gamma-ray detection device in the world, was completed in July 2021 and began high-quality and stable operation after that. The facility is operated by the Institute of High Energy Physics of CAS with a universal international cooperation model to achieve open sharing of facility platforms and observational data. Currently, 32 domestic and foreign astrophysics research institutions have become international collaboration members of LHAASO.

New orchid species found in SW China
 (Xinhua) 11:16, February 26, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- A new orchid species was discovered during a recent plant resource survey in the Tongbiguan Provincial-level Nature Reserve in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
The discovery, made by a team consisting of researchers from the reserve and the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, has been published in the journal Phytotaxa.
Through morphological and molecular systematic research comparisons, researchers determined that the species was a new species of Calanthe in the Orchidaceae family, and named it Calanthe yingjiangensis.
It is similar to Calanthe puberula, but it differs from the latter in having a midlob of lip with an elliptic yellow spot near the base of the column and four purple veins.
At present, Calanthe yingjiangensis has only been found in the understory at an altitude of 1,600 to 1,800 meters above sea level in Yingjiang County, Yunnan.

Chinese firms can narrow AI gap with US within 1 or 2 years: founder of cybersecurity company

The main difference between China and the US in artificial intelligence (AI) lies in ""determining the technical direction,"" but once the direction is determined, with China's strong advantage in its rapid learning capabilities, the gap will be narrowed within one or two years, said Zhou Hongyi, founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology who is also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the upcoming two sessions.
2024 may become the ""year of application"" for China in the field of AI, Zhou told the Global Times on Friday, reaffirming his confidence in China's development in the realm of AI, believing that large models will have great potential in many vertical areas across the economy this year.
""It may be difficult for China to create a universal large model, which surpasses GPT-4 for now, but it is entirely possible to surpass GPT-4 in some vertical fields,"" Zhou said.
Last week, OpenAI released Sora, a text-to-video AI generator, which can create realistic videos based on user text prompts, sparking global attention and discussion. Zhou said on the following day that OpenAI likely still has some unleashed secret weapons, suggesting that there are still gap between China and the US in this regard.
""I believe there is a gap between China and the US, and I have always insisted on saying so. Only by recognizing the gap can we know how to catch up. If you don't admit there is a gap and think we are all far ahead every day, then it won't work,"" Zhou told the Global Times on Friday.
He believes that the main gap between China and the US in AI lies in the ""original direction"" for AI technology, referring to transformers, a deep-learning architecture that OpenAI is based on. Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that learns context and meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data.
Zhou explained that when the Japanese dominated electric cars, they chose a hydrogen architecture, Toyota went with a hybrid architecture, and Tesla went with a pure electric battery architecture. Through continuous development, BYD now has the opportunity to surpass Tesla in sales, he said.
Through these examples, Zhou emphasized that the main gap between China and others lies in the sense of direction. Considering that transformer architecture, Sora, and the like are fundamentally software, this kind of gap can be bridged within one to two years, Zhou noted.
""Once the direction is determined, Chinese companies' learning capabilities are very fast. Especially when peers release open-source projects or publish papers publicly, it is not a difficult problem for Chinese teams to follow up.""
When discussing the impact and prospects of Sora, Zhou mentioned that what impressed him the most about Sora is that those generating videos are just a ""by-product."" In the process, Sora needs to learn a lot of video material, not just how to draw patterns, but more importantly, it must understand the interactive relationships among many elements in the real world.
""Some argue with me that drawing software can also depict a dog in the snow, but the issue is, depicting a static dog and snow doesn't require understanding common sense; you just need to draw according to the image. However, to show a dog frolicking in the snow, with snow falling softly, requires learning and accumulation of real-world common sense,"" he explained.
He also indicated that in the end, technological competition boils down to talent density and profound accumulation. AI may not necessarily disrupt all industries quickly, but it can stimulate creativity in more people.
""Sora brings us a step closer to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence),"" Zhou told the Global Times.
GPT actually solves the problem of mutual understanding and interaction between machines and humans, which is overcoming the first major hurdle. However, it doesn't know many of the rules of this world; for example, training a robot to fetch tomatoes from the fridge and then fry eggs would be difficult because it needs to know that tomatoes don't break when dropped, whereas eggs do, he explained.
""It also needs to know how to crack eggs, something it must have seen like a human. I think this might be unintentionally achieved by OpenAI in developing Sora. Through this training method, machines can interact with the world,"" Zhou said.
This implies that Sora may be applied in the future in robotics and autonomous driving fields, as it has developed a perception of interaction with the real world.
Discussing the prospects of China's AI development in 2024, Zhou said that 2024 should be the ""year of application"" for Chinese AI, believing that large models will have great potential in many vertical fields of enterprises this year. ""Large models should trigger an industrial revolution in the future, accompanying enterprises into various industries and integrating with many business processes and product functionalities.""
Creating a universal large model that surpasses GPT-4 may be challenging at the moment, but GPT-4 currently ""knows everything, yet not specialized."" If we can excel in a particular business domain by training a large model with unique business data and integrating it with many business tools within that vertical, such a large model will not only have intelligence but also possess unique knowledge, even hands and feet, he said. ""It is entirely possible for China to surpass GPT-4 in some vertical domains.""
Some argue that the development of large models in China requires significant effort in content security and regulation. But Zhou believes that large models worldwide face security challenges, especially when it comes to ensuring their trustworthiness, controllability and reliability.
""Large models can either assist good people or become accomplices to bad people. For example, in the past, you had to know programming to conduct cyberattacks, but now you can converse with a large model by tipping it and it can diligently assist you, even colluding with you,"" he said.
Videos generated by Sora can be used to interfere in US elections, become a weapon affecting national security, or could even be used for fraud, presenting significant dangers. As AI technology has advanced beyond legal frameworks, the world is considering how to effectively regulate AI and prevent it from being misused or exploited, which is currently a global challenge, Zhou noted.
""I don't think regulation hinders the progress of AI. On the contrary, without any regulation, various AI tools developed by major internet companies may not be utilized by good people,"" he said.
Zhou indicated that reasonable regulation should have a positive impact on the development of AI, rather than being perceived as a hindrance.

China unveils names for manned lunar exploration vehicles
 (Xinhua) 10:10, February 26, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) on Saturday unveiled the names of the new vehicles for future manned lunar exploration missions.
The new manned spacecraft is named Mengzhou, meaning dream vessel, which reflects the fact that the manned lunar exploration carries the Chinese people's space dream and opens a new journey of space adventure, according to the CMSA.
The lunar lander is named Lanyue, meaning embracing the moon, a term that appeared in a poem written by the late Chairman Mao Zedong. The word symbolizes the Chinese people's confidence in exploring the universe, said the agency.
The names were selected from nearly 2,000 proposals solicited from the public.
China plans to land its taikonauts on the moon before 2030 to carry out scientific exploration. The plan is to launch two carrier rockets to send a manned spacecraft and a lunar lander, respectively, into lunar orbit. The spacecraft and lunar lander will rendezvous and dock with each other, after which the taikonauts will enter the lander.
So far, the research and development of Mengzhou, Lanyue and Long March-10 carrier rocket have been progressing smoothly, said the CMSA.

BEIJING, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- As the Chinese people were exchanging their wishes for a prosperous Year of the Loong, an array of machines bearing the name of this zodiac animal were also capturing public attention due to their exceptional performances and encouraging prospects.
The loong, also known as the Chinese dragon, epitomizes resilience, dynamism, and vitality within Chinese culture. People in China commonly refer to this mythical creature as ""long,"" phonetically transcribing the corresponding Chinese character.
Some spacecraft, aircraft, and watercraft that include references to ""long"" have been under the spotlight since the lunar new year. People hold high hopes for them to embark on even more remarkable endeavors and continue to achieve greater feats in the new year.
JIELONG
SpaceX's Dragon craft often features in the headlines, while China's commercial rocket named Smart Dragon, or ""Jielong"" in Chinese pinyin, has also garnered significant media coverage this month.
A Smart Dragon-3 (SD-3) solid-propellant rocket blasted off from a launch service ship off the coast of Yangjiang in Guangdong Province on Feb. 3, sending nine satellites into space. The bright rocket flame soaring from the sea attracted thousands of spectators to the onshore viewing site.

This successful liftoff was the latest flight mission of the SD-3, a member of China's Dragon rocket family. Unlike the Long March rockets, the country's backbone launch vehicles, the Dragon series has been developed specifically to meet the growing market demand for launching low-orbit small commercial satellites and satellite networks.
Developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the four-stage SD-3 recorded its maiden flight in December 2022 from a ship in the Yellow Sea.
""The SD-3 has filled many blanks in China's space industry,"" said Guan Hongren, chief designer of the rocket, who highlighted its ability to send a payload of 1.5 tonnes to sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 500 km. This carrying capacity is more than seven times that of the first-generation Dragon rocket SD-1.
At least four more SD-3 rockets will be launched in 2024. To increase its competitiveness in the booming commercial space industry, China is planning the development of an SD-4 rocket with greater carrying capacity. The near future will witness the emergence of a larger and more energetic ""dragon"" soaring through the skies.
KUNLONG
The sky has already been graced by the flight of two ""water dragons.""
Two prototypes of the China-made seaplane AG600M, codenamed ""Kunlong,"" recently completed test flights in an extremely cold environment.
Video footage posted on Chinese news portals showed these aircraft taking off from a snow-covered airport in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. According to the Aviation Industry Corp of China, the aircraft's manufacturer, the two-week-long test validated the aircraft's capability and performance in extreme freezing temperatures, ranging from -20 degrees Celsius to -40 degrees Celsius.

""Kun"" refers to a giant fish in Chinese mythology. Kunlong is a versatile aircraft that can take off and land on both water and the ground.
The AG600M, a member of China's AG600 family of amphibious aircraft, is designed for aerial firefighting operations. It boasts a maximum take-off weight of 60 tonnes and can carry up to 12 tonnes of water, allowing it to cover a flight range of up to 4,500 km. Additionally, its ability to perform low-altitude flying at low speeds enables precise water drops on fire sites.
The AG600M prototype completed its first test landing on land in May 2022 and landed on water for the first time in August that same year.
The aircraft manufacturer aims to obtain the type certificate for the AG600M by the end of 2024. Since the seaplane model has already secured purchase orders, its market entry is on the horizon.
JIAOLONG
The Chinese dragon not only possesses the ability to go up to the sky but also down to the depths of the ocean.
""Jiaolong"" is a mythical sea dragon, but it also refers to a Chinese manned submersible that is capable of diving to depths exceeding 7,000 meters. It was named after the mythical creature because of its deep-sea exploration capability.

Jiaolong set a record by diving to a depth of 7,062 meters during tests in the Mariana Trench in 2012. Although this record was later broken by the Fendouzhe submersible, Jiaolong has accomplished numerous tasks and established remarkable achievements since setting that now former record.
This year, Jiaolong embarked on a new mission. The submersible, carried aboard China's research vessel ""Deep Sea No. 1,"" has reached the South Atlantic Ocean and is being used during what is China's 83rd ocean expedition in that region.

Ninety-seven Chinese cities have newly become ""gigabit cities"" in 2023, meaning they gained the capability to offer gigabit 5G and gigabit optical fiber services, known as ""dual gigabit,"" said China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) recently.
Building gigabit cities is a landmark project of new digital infrastructure development in China. As of the end of October 2023, all households in China's gigabit cities had been covered by gigabit optical fiber services. On average, there were 21.2 5G base stations per 10,000 people in gigabit cities. The average proportion of 10G-PON ports stood at 53.7 percent. The average proportion of users with speed of 500Mbps or higher reached 33.2 percent, and the average 5G users account for 49.2 percent.
In gigabit cities, over 99.5 percent of public hospitals that rank at the top of China's three-tier grading system, key universities, cultural and tourist areas, as well as train stations (above second class) offering passenger services, main airports, and key roads were covered by 5G network, the MIIT said, adding that the accessibility rate stood at 100 percent in 91 of these cities.

Gigabit cities have vigorously promoted the innovation and application of gigabit 5G and optical fiber technologies, and actively explored the deployment and construction plans as well as business models for the coordinated development of ""dual gigabit."" This has enabled various industries to improve productivity and efficiency.
For example, in Zhuzhou, central China's Hunan province, the efficiency of topcoat painting quality inspection has been improved by 30 percent thanks to the application of 5G+ smart factories. Shijiazhuang in north China's Hebei province has leveraged ""dual gigabit"" networks to build intelligent hospitals, leading to a 50 percent improvement in the efficiency of X-ray image processing. In Ziyang, southwest China's Sichuan province, technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things, big data, and cloud computing have been utilized to enhance the Internet plus government services.
How the list of gigabit cities in China is getting longer and longer? According to an official with the MIIT, those new gigabit cities continuously increased policy support to encourage various market entities to actively participate in the construction of gigabit cities. Efforts have been made to address the bottlenecks, difficulties, and pain points in the construction and application of ""dual gigabit"" networks.

For instance, some gigabit cities have strengthened policy support by incorporating fiber optic network construction and 5G site planning into the same-level national territory spatial planning. Baoji in northwest China's Shaanxi province and Lhasa, capital of Xizang autonomous region have introduced relevant policies to support the development of ""dual gigabit."" Zhongshan in south China's Guangdong province and Danzhou in south China's Hainan province have included fiber optic network construction plans in the same-level national territory spatial information platform.
In addition, in terms of reducing the construction costs of ""dual gigabit"", some gigabit cities have exempted or reduced rental fees for occupying public places to construct fiber optic networks, 5G base stations and other communication infrastructure.
Harbin in northeast China's Heilongjiang province has opened up tourist attractions, parks, green spaces, street lamps and other public facilities for free 5G base station construction. Zhumadian in central China's Henan province, Anshan in northeast China's Liaoning province and some other places have promoted unconditional free opening of facilities owned by government agencies, public institutions, as well as public places like airports, train stations, high-speed rail stations, etc. for 5G base station construction.
The MIIT said it will leverage the exemplary and leading role of gigabit cities, strengthen exchanges of typical experiences, promote a pattern where key cities take the lead and other cities develop simultaneously, and foster a favorable environment for development.

BEIJING, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- China is gearing up to develop more advanced equipment to promote the modernization of the country's emergency management systems and capabilities.
Multiple new models of aircraft, smart robots and other equipment for emergency response are on the fast track of development and application, thanks to the joint efforts of government authorities and manufacturers.
The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) is endeavoring to speed up the progress of key models of aeronautical equipment tailored to serve the country's emergency rescue demands, according to the AVIC, China's leading aircraft manufacturer.
Significant advancements are being made in the homegrown emergency-rescue aircraft, including the AG600 series of large amphibious aircraft, the Wing Loong series of large civil unmanned aerial vehicles, the MA60 firefighting airplane, the AC-series civil helicopters, and others.
The AG600M firefighting aircraft, a firefighting model belonging to the AG600 large amphibious aircraft family, is aiming to obtain its type certificate before the end of 2024, according to the AVIC.
The aircraft has entered the key phase of airworthiness compliance verification. It has recently completed the cold-weather flight tests and is now progressing to additional phases of flight testing, which is a crucial step in securing airworthiness certification.
The AG600 large amphibious aircraft family is tailored to carry out firefighting, maritime search and rescue, and other rescue missions in all terrains across the country.
China's MA60 firefighting aircraft, a new member of the Modern Ark multipurpose aircraft family, also initiated its flight tests in late January to verify its compliance with the airworthiness regulations of the Chinese civil aviation authorities, the AVIC said.
The AVIC added it is committed to facilitating the development and application of emergency rescue aeronautical equipment to sustain the country's capabilities in emergency management.
Robots are also playing increasingly important roles in the emergency rescue sector as they can be used for multiple purposes including search and rescue during emergencies.
China plans to accelerate efforts to produce a batch of sophisticated emergency response robots. In January, the Ministry of Emergency Management and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology jointly issued a guideline to boost the development and application of emergency response robot technologies.
The major goal is to develop a batch of advanced emergency response robots that are more professional, refined and intelligent by 2025, according to the guideline.
Emergency response robots are intelligent machines designed to carry out tasks such as monitoring and early warning, search and rescue operations, communication commands, and other critical functions in disaster prevention, mitigation and relief efforts.
Efforts will be made to develop emergency response robots for key tasks such as life search, material support, fire extinguishing, high-risk operations, and complex rescue during emergencies like floods, fires, earthquakes, geological disasters, and others.
The guideline also emphasizes the cultivation of bases and ecosystems to facilitate testing and pilot applications of these robots, while encouraging increased utilization and support for their use in emergency rescue operations.
The development and application of emergency-response robots are of symbolic significance to China's emergency management system and the capability modernization of the sector, according to the guideline.

 (Xinhua) 15:54, February 22, 2024
LANZHOU, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has successfully used muons imaging technology to detect the internal structure of a mineral deposit, providing a new approach to mineral exploration and geological structure imaging.
The research results were recently published online in the Geophysical Journal International.
The exploration of underground orebodies and the precise location of goaf areas have been some of the challenges faced by the mining industry. Traditional mineral exploration techniques have high economic cost and low accuracy.
As one of the fundamental particles in nature, muons have a significant penetration capability, which can realize non-contact, deep penetrating, and non-destructive imaging of large objects. Compared with conventional artificial ray devices, they have incomparable advantages, said Liu Zhiyi, research leader at Lanzhou University.
The research team used muons as detection rays to obtain images of the large objects, which is a new, green, non-destructive technology for studying the internal structure of mineral deposits.
Muons imaging technology is expected to provide a more efficient solution for mineral resource development and utilization.
The technology can also confirm the position and shape of orebodies through large-scale scanning, reducing costs and risks as well as improving efficiency.
Muons imaging technology reduces environmental damage and pollution, compared with traditional exploration methods such as batch ground drilling or the use of explosives.
Based on the technology, the team developed detection equipment sets complete with its independent intellectual property rights, and conducted field measurement in a gold mine in northwest China's Gansu Province.
The team used six sets of equipment to scan a large area of the gold mine, and it yielded remarkable results, said Liu Juntao with Lanzhou University.
The imaging results clearly showed gold veins, several goaf areas and a low density geological structure above the scanned area, said Wang Yuxi, an engineer on the project.
The research team also used muons imaging technology to check the condition of the renowned Xi'an ancient city wall in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.

Chinese researchers synthesize novel nucleus isotopes
 (Xinhua) 15:51, February 22, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have synthesized two new nucleus isotopes that contain 84 neutrons and 82 neutrons, according to a recent research article published in the journal Physical Review Letters.
The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Different numbers of protons and neutrons make up nuclei with different properties which were called nucleus isotopes by scientists.
The synthesis and study of new nucleus isotopes are of great significance for understanding both the structure of matter and the evolution of the celestial environment.
Previous experiments on proton-rich nuclei that contain around 126 neutrons showed that a higher proton number eventually renders the nucleus unstable. To see if the same behavior occurs for nuclei that contain around 82 neutrons, the researchers from the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, studied the osmium-160.
They synthesized osmium-160 and wolframium-156 and found that the osmium-160 contains 84 neutrons and 76 protons, more protons than any other 84-neutron nucleus.
The study illustrates the evolution of a neutron shell with 82 neutrons on the neutron-deficient side of the nucleus isotopes.
