AI empowers traditional Chinese medicine to explore new potentials
 (Xinhua) 09:35, March 29, 2024
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- How can artificial intelligence (AI) impact on the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a practice spanning thousands of years, particularly at the grassroots level? This integration of TCM and AI has attracted increasing interest from hospitals, scholars and companies alike.
Seated in front of a desktop device, a person has a few photos of their face and tongue captured and then respond to five questions. Soon after, a comprehensive report detailing their specific physical conditions within the framework of TCM is readily available on their cellphone -- all thanks to AI.
In a community medical service center in Guangzhou, capital city of south China's Guangdong Province, many elderly residents who have used this AI equipment were impressed by the technology and the credible results.
An individual's personalized physical condition assessment, forming the cornerstone of tailored TCM diagnosis and treatment, constitutes a vital aspect of this practice.
China's National Standards for Basic Public Services (2023) stipulates that people over 65 years old should be provided with TCM physical condition appraisal and health care guidance at least once a year.
Previously, generating such a report took a longer duration, and many senior citizens found the process to be tedious and complicated, occasionally struggling to complete it.
They had to complete a form with 33 questions and it would take about 20 minutes as they needed to read and fill the form themselves or ask for help from the staff, said Han Yiyu, a physician at the center in the Shipai sub-district.
""Now with the newly installed AI equipment, the process only takes two minutes,"" said Yang Haiwen, deputy director of the center.
The equipment was developed by researchers from the South China University of Technology (SCUT) based on a machine-learning model. Following a series of training by TCM experts, the model can distinguish various diatheses and physical conditions from facial and tongue images, offering personalized health improvement advice accordingly.
In recent years, AI technologies and equipment such as AI prescription systems, acupuncture robots, and tui-na (massage) robots have increasingly penetrated TCM clinics.
Utilizing modern technologies, intelligent TCM products have narrowed the gap between people's growing demand for health care and the limited capacity of primary-level medical institutions.
Wu Jun, a researcher on the application of AI in TCM with the SCUT, has noticed an increasing interest in the TCM field in leveraging computer science and AI technology. ""More people have seen the potential of AI, and they expect the technology to help promote TCM and enable it to play a greater role in primary-level health services,"" Wu said.
The application of AI might alleviate the shortage of experienced TCM professionals at primary-level institutions, especially in remote areas, said Wang Zhengfei, a researcher at the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine.
""With the assistance of AI, doctors at the primary level may obtain technical skills equivalent to experienced doctors and enhance their diagnostic accuracy. In this way, we can expect a broad application prospect of AI (in the TCM field),"" Wang said.
While many are optimistic about AI's potential contribution to the modernization and advancement of TCM, several challenges still need to be addressed.
According to Wu, one major challenge is the standardization of TCM theories. There are different schools of TCM theories and they vary in diagnosis and treatment methods, posing challenges to product development and recognition.
Another challenge lies in the integration of TCM and technology. As AI relies on deep learning neural networks rather than predefined programs to generate results, medical professionals may question the results due to the challenge of accurately explaining the AI's working process.
Considering the challenges, the industry is striving to find solutions, Wu said.

Experts, execs stress responsible AI
By Cheng Yu (China Daily) 15:31, March 28, 2024

Participants discuss AI issues at the ongoing Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2024 in Boao, Hainan province, on Wednesday. FENG YONGBIN/CHINA DAILY
No country, including the United States, can single-handedly lead the future development of artificial intelligence, and only global cooperation can ensure that AI will remain safe and beneficial for all, said field experts and company executives at the ongoing Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2024 in Boao, Hainan province, on Wednesday.
Their remarks were an attempt to address ""AI anxiety"" among sections of the Chinese AI industry consequent to the launch of text-to-video model Sora by US firm Open-AI.
Zeng Yi, a researcher of the Institute of Automation, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a member of the United Nations High-level Advisory Body on AI, said: ""The US will not lead the future AI development alone, nor will China. Unless we move forward hand in hand, no country will.""
Zeng emphasized that AI is a foundational technology and an enabler.
""The world is vast enough to allow China, the US and many other countries to find their own opportunities in building infrastructure and driving applications.
""If the culture of China differs from that of the US, then please provide a profound understanding of how a different culture might envision the empowerment of technology in the future and how we can deeply integrate science and humanity to offer more possibilities for the world.""
The more pressing issue, he said, is how the world can unite to truly develop AI that is safer, more reliable and more trustworthy.
Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a leading AI researcher, said that competition in the field is by and large healthy, but the idea of a zero-sum game is a ""huge mistake"".
""If AI can be created to be safe and beneficial, and more capable than human beings, then it can function as a source of unlimited wealth,"" he said. ""In that sense, there is no need to compete for such technology.""
Russell further said that a more important issue is to coexist healthily and safely with this technology, which is still an open question for the world.
Chinese tech companies such as iFlytek, Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings, Baidu Inc, ByteDance and Huawei Technologies as well as thousands of startups are scrambling to develop AI large models. Many of them have gathered momentum over the past year.
As of October, China had developed 254 AI large models with a parameter of at least a billion tokens each, according to a report released by the Beijing Municipal Science &Technology Commission. Tokens are chunks of text that AI learns from, while a parameter is used for evaluating numeric data.
Liu Cong, vice-president of iFlytek and head of iFlytek's research institute, said the company's SparkDesk AI large model has had great improvements and is expected to catch up with ChatGPT-4 in Chinese abilities by the middle of this year. More importantly, it is trained on a totally independent computing power platform.
""But we have to note that only when the large model is applied can it become an important engine for new quality productive forces,"" he said.
""Facing the future, China must get a clear understanding of its gaps with those of international levels and, meanwhile, leverage its joint forces on resources to accelerate the systematic construction of AI.""
Liu said that focus should be sharpened on the social risks and ethical challenges that the AI tech may pose, in order to ensure AI becomes a tool to build a better world.

New journey begins for fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program,2024-03-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0328/c90000-20150651.html,"Home>>
		
New journey begins for fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program
By Feng Hua (People's Daily) 14:35, March 28, 2024
On March 20, China sent a new relay satellite into space to provide Earth-Moon communications services.
The relay satellite dubbed Queqiao-2, or Magpie Bridge-2, was launched by the Long March-8 Y3 carrier rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Site in south China's Hainan province at 8:31 a.m. Beijing Time.

""As a 'key link' in the implementation of the fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program, the Queqiao-2 relay satellite will serve as a communications hub,"" according to Ge Ping, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
The fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program, reportedly approved for implementation in December 2021, consists of four missions: Chang'e-4, Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8. Among them, Chang'e-4 was launched in December 2018, achieving the first-ever soft landing and roving exploration on the far side of the moon in the world. Chang'e-6 is scheduled for launch in the first half of this year, while Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 will form the basic model of a lunar research station and carry out tasks including exploration of the lunar environment.
Why is it necessary to launch the Queqiao-2 relay satellite?
Experts explained that since the moon always has one side facing away from the Earth, probes landing on the far side of the moon are blocked by the moon itself, making it impossible to directly communicate and transmit data with the measurement-control system on Earth. In this case, a relay satellite is needed to bridge the information connection between ground stations and the lunar probe.
China launched the first relay satellite Queqiao in 2018 to transmit signals between ground stations and the Chang'e-4 probe that landed on the far side of the moon. So far, the Queqiao has been in orbit for many years and has exceeded its designed lifespan.
""The landing and sample collection sites of the fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program are mainly in the lunar south pole region or on the far side of the moon. Therefore, a relay satellite with broader functionality and higher performance is needed to establish a new 'relay communications station' between the moon and Earth to overcome communications and data transmission challenges,"" Ge said.
Compared with the first Queqiao relay satellite, the Queqiao-2 relay satellite boasts more technological innovations, a broader range of technical capabilities, enhanced functionalities, more complex interfaces, higher development complexity, and a longer mission time span. Besides serving Earth-Moon communications, it also carries multiple scientific payloads and will conduct scientific exploration missions.
According to the CNSA, in addition to the fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program, the Queqiao-2 can also provide Earth-Moon communications services for future domestic and international lunar exploration missions.

When it comes to the Chang'e-6 set to return samples from the far side of the moon, experts said that all 10 lunar sample return missions conducted by humans by far have taken place on the near side of the moon. The far side of the moon is generally older than the near side and contains the Aitken Basin, one of the three major lunar terranes, making it highly valuable for scientific research.
The pre-selected landing area for the Chang'e-6 mission is the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon, thus enabling the probe to discover and collect lunar samples from different regions and ages to help humans learn more about the moon.
Following the successful mission of the Chang'e-6, scientists will conduct systematic and long-term research on the lunar samples from the far side of the moon, analyzing the structure, physical properties, and material composition of the lunar regolith to deepen human understanding of the moon's origin and evolutionary history.
Currently, a new wave of lunar exploration is sweeping across the world, with major spacefaring nations actively engaging in lunar exploration activities.
Ge noted that China has always been attaching importance to international cooperation in its lunar exploration program, and China's door is always open for collaborative efforts, which have been proven by many vivid examples and win-win results in previous lunar exploration missions.
China has initiated the application process for global researchers to study the lunar samples brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission and will openly solicit plans for cooperation in the following tasks of the fourth phase of the lunar exploration program and the planetary exploration program, according to Ge.
The CNSA said the Chang'e-6 mission will carry a radon gas detector from France, a negative ion detector from the European Space Agency, a laser retroreflector from Italy, and Pakistan's CubeSat.
At the same time, China is speeding up efforts to build the International Lunar Research Station, a mega science project, and hopes that more international partners will join in this endeavor to expand humanity's cognitive frontiers and contribute to the peaceful use of outer space and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

Efforts are being made in the building of long tunnels in the Himalayan region, with Chinese companies setting a record by digging 1,503.3 meters of tunnel in a month at the Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project in Sindhuli, Nepal, the Science and Technology Daily reported on Tuesday.
The water diversion project has been jointly undertaken by China Railway Second Bureau Group and China Overseas Engineering Group Company (COVEC).
The 13.3-kilometer tunnel is expected to become the world's first ultra-long and ultra-deep water diversion tunnel that passes through the Himalayas and the Kathmandu spiral formation.
A tunnel boring machine (TBM), also known as a ""mole,"" has been used to cut through the hills so as to excavate the tunnels. The TBMs used in the project have achieved a single-month advance of 1,503.3 meters, breaking the world record set by the project team in 2023, the report said.
Chen Song, the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, expressed appreciation for the efforts made by the Chinese companies.
Mitra Baral, head of the Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project, said that 12.3 kilometers of tunnel digging work has been completed, according to local Nepalese newspaper Republica, and the tunnel will break through in May, he added.
The diversion tunnel will redirect part of the flow of the Sunkoshi River to the Bagmati River to irrigate farmland to the south of the outer foothills of the Himalayas, the local Kathmandu Post reported.
The project was first mooted on October 14, 2022. After completion, it will solve difficulties in agricultural irrigation and alleviate the current shortage of electricity in the area, which is of great significance for promoting the social development of the eastern region of Nepal.

Letter from China: Earth Hour: Lights off, green action on
By Zhou Qianxian (Xinhua) 11:36, March 28, 2024
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- On Saturday night, I participated in the Earth Hour lights-out activity in China's host city Ordos. It was a deeply moving experience.
From 20:30 to 21:30, all iconic public buildings in Ordos in north China's Inner Mongolia, went dark, joining landmarks worldwide including the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House and the London Eye.
Standing in the darkness, surrounded by the muted glow of streetlights and dim outlines of familiar objects, I felt a renewed sense of hope for the future of our planet.
The hour was not just a moment of darkness, but a beacon of hope, illuminating the path toward a sustainable future.
Earth Hour was initiated by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to encourage individuals worldwide to come forward to preserve energy. For its 18th edition this year, people from 190 countries and territories participated by switching off non-essential lights on the last Saturday of March.
According to organizers, the hour is a moment of unity that brings the world together, shining a spotlight on nature loss and the climate crisis, and inspiring millions more to act and advocate for urgent change.
How should I spend 60 minutes doing something positive for our planet? I chose to pick up trash in our neighborhood while listening to a podcast about climate change, and then share information about climate change with those involved.
The renowned light painting artist Wang Sibo, also helped guide us in creating light art, as a way to advocate for the public's engagement and attention toward protecting the natural ecology.
In the daytime, I participated in a series of themed activities for the event, organized by the WWF, the Center for Environmental Education and Communications of Ministry of Ecology and Environment, and the Ordos municipal government.
An international seminar focusing on ""green, low-carbon, and high-quality development"" attracted nearly 100 government representatives, industry experts and business delegates to discuss the future of low-carbon development, energy transformation, and climate innovation.
""We are pleased to see that China's energy transition is progressing in a steady and orderly manner,"" said Zhou Fei, Chief Program Officer of WWF China, at the seminar.
Pan Jiahua with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences told that in honoring its pledge to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, China has advanced the green transition of its economy and the development of ecological civilization on a robust scale with a slew of practical measures.
Ordos, known as China's coal capital, for example, has propelled green transformations in its energy, industry, and transportation sectors in recent years, said Du Huiliang, mayor of the Ordos municipal government.
To date, Ordos has installed new energy facilities with a total capacity of 10.4 million kilowatt, resulting in an annual generation of over 20 billion kilowatt-hours of green electricity. This achievement has led to the conservation of approximately 6.2 million tonnes of standard coal and a reduction of about 16.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, according to the city's bureau of ecology and environment.
After the seminar, my visit to Ordos Net Zero Industrial Park initiated and established by Envision Group, was an eye-opener.
In the park, a new electric system caught my attention. Through an intelligent IoT system and an energy island combining wind power, solar power, energy storage, and green hydrogen, 80 percent of the power will be supplied directly with green energy, with the remaining 20 percent traded with the grid. This achieves a 100 percent supply of green energy.
Stepping into an intelligent battery factory in the park, I encountered a bustling scene of production and assembly, with the production lines introducing advanced processes and state-of-the-art equipment to achieve a high level of automation. This not only significantly improves production efficiency but also ensures product consistency.
The park's design and operation are a blend of efficiency and eco-friendliness, showcasing how economic growth can achieve while minimizing impact on the planet.
Delving deeper, I realized that Ordos Net Zero Industrial Park is not the only one blazing a trail to a green future since the concept of ""green is for green, green is for growth and green is for great"" is widely accepted in China.
Earth Hour activity was also a reminder that every one of us has the power to make a difference, even in the smallest of ways. I am already looking forward to the Earth Hour next year and hope you will join me!

Experts at Boao forum express optimism about AI but urge oversight
 (Xinhua) 10:32, March 28, 2024
BOAO, Hainan, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Guest speakers of a panel discussion on artificial intelligence (AI) at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2024 expressed optimism on the development prospects of AI while also urging efforts to beef up industry oversight.
The performance of the large language models, such as GPT-4, is extremely impressive, said Stuart Russell, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of California at Berkeley.
""It gives us a taste of what it would be like to live in a world where we could access intelligence on tap in the same way that we access electricity anytime you need,"" added Russell, who is also co-author of ""Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach,"" which is considered the standard text in the field of AI.
According to the veteran AI researcher, there are still very significant gaps in this technology.
Since ChatGPT took the world by storm in late 2022, tech giants and startups worldwide have been rushing to join the AI race by launching similar AI chatbots as well as industrial applications based on large language models.
The AI fever has kindled high hopes that this technology will have the potential to transform people's lives and work through the content they generate, known as AI-generated content (AIGC). It also has fanned fear that AI could pose a threat to human beings in the future.
According to Zhang Yaqin, dean of the Institute for AI Industry Research at Tsinghua University, AI can generate not only texts, images and videos, but also a plethora of other content. ""There is good news about change, but there are also some concerns about the risks that we have right now.""
Expressing optimism about AI, Zhang said, ""I think that there are two kinds of human wisdom. One wisdom is the wisdom of inventing new technologies, and the other is the wisdom of guiding technology toward wisdom.""
He, however, stressed that governance should be in place while the industry is developing.
Spawning a large number of applications for industries and scientific research, the AI boom is driving the development of China's digital economy and reshaping the economic landscape.
Liu Cong, vice president of China's AI and intelligent speech giant iFLYTEK, said following the launch of its large language model, the company has launched a number of applications for specific industries, including the education and medical fields.
""The AI plus is very likely to offer us a great opportunity to develop new quality productive forces,"" Liu said, adding that its open innovation platform has attracted 370,000 developers for large models.
Speaking at the panel discussion, Frank Meng, Qualcomm China chairman, called for global and industry cooperation in terms of AI state governance, international collaboration, and standard setting that would allow universal use.
Russell called for healthy competition in the AI race. ""This idea that it's a zero-sum game and one team is gonna win and the other team is gonna lose. This is a huge mistake.""

China's Northwestern Polytechnical University develops AI robotic guide dog
 (People's Daily Online) 14:12, March 26, 2024
A robotic guide dog, marking a major advance in offline embodied artificial intelligence, has been developed by a team at China’s Northwestern Polytechnical University.
Embodied AI refers to intelligent machines with a physical form that can interact with the environment in real time. Professor Li Xuelong and his team designed the robotic dog to function independently offline, enabling it to intelligently interact with humans and assist them in various situations, such as using elevators, crossing streets, and navigating indoor environments.

The video screenshot shows a robotic guide dog developed by Professor Li Xuelong's team at Northwestern Polytechnical University. 
According to Li, the robotic guide dog demonstrates the potential of offline embodied AI as a feasible alternative to traditional guide dogs, emphasizing its ability to operate independently without internet connectivity. Moreover, it introduces an innovative solution to alleviate the shortage of guide dogs available to visually impaired individuals.
In recent years, the development of robotic guide dogs has accelerated, fueled by advancements in robotics and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology.
However, earlier versions of these robotic guide dogs could not engage in free conversation with humans, primarily due to limitations in natural language processing technology. This shortfall also impeded their ability to provide emotional companionship.
To overcome these limitations, Professor Li's team combined the latest techniques in large-model quantization, compression, and accelerated inference. This approach enabled them to successfully deploy large models on the robotic dog's low-power computing platform, thus validating the feasibility of offline embodied AI.
The robotic guide dog has proven effective at communicating with visually impaired individuals, guiding them through various challenging environments such as roads, stairs, and elevators. Experiments conducted by the team have confirmed that the robotic guide dog can intelligently interact with humans, provide guidance in areas with weak network connectivity, and navigate indoor spaces.

Female frogs use winking as flirting tactic: study
 (Xinhua) 11:31, March 26, 2024
HEFEI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found that the behavior of blinking, previously believed to be a social signal mainly observed in certain primates, particularly humans and their companion animals, extends to female frogs, who utilize eyeblinks to communicate with males, encouraging them to initiate amplexus.
The relevant study by scientists from Anhui Normal University was recently published in the journal Current Biology.
According to the research team, female concave-eared torrent frogs (Odorrana tormota), which inhabit noisy streams and are known to use ultrasonic communication, also use eyeblinks to communicate with males to urge them to initiate amplexus for mating.
The discovery demonstrates that eyelid movement serves signaling functions in some non-primate species, expanding beyond its traditional roles of physiological functions, such as lubricating the cornea and clearing dust particles.
Through experimental methods like field observations, controlled amplexus experiments and video playback, the researchers observed female frogs emit blinking signals to males they favor. Only upon receiving this blinking signal can a male frog successfully engage in mating with the female, otherwise, it risks rejection.
According to Zhang Fang, head of the research team, the study represents a significant advancement in the field of frog communication behavior, offering valuable insights into the origin and evolution of visual communication among animals.

China's Queqiao-2 relay satellite enters orbit around the moon,2024-03-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0326/c90000-20149272.html,"Home>>
		
China's Queqiao-2 relay satellite enters orbit around the moon
 (Xinhua) 11:11, March 26, 2024
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Queqiao-2 relay satellite has successfully performed a near-moon braking procedure and entered its circumlunar orbit, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said on Monday.
At 12.46 a.m. (Beijing Time) on Monday, after approximately 112 flight hours, the satellite began near-moon braking at a distance of about 440 kilometers from the lunar surface and entered its circumlunar orbit smoothly 19 minutes later, the CNSA said.
By adjusting the altitude and inclination of its circumlunar orbit, Queqiao-2 will enter its target elliptical orbit around the moon and carry out a communication test with the Chang'e-4 and Chang'e-6 lunar probes as planned.
Near-moon braking is the most critical orbital control action during lunar satellite flight. A satellite must begin braking when approaching the moon to maintain a speed lower than the moon's escape velocity so that it can be captured by the moon's gravitational force and realize circumlunar flight.
Two communication and navigation technology test satellites, Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2, were sent into space together with Queqiao-2. They also completed near-moon brakes on the same day and entered their circumlunar orbits. The separation of the two satellites will be carried out as planned, the CNSA said.
Queqiao-2, which translates to ""magpie bridge 2,"" was launched on March 20 to provide Earth-Moon communication services. It will undertake lunar exploration missions such as sample retrieval on the far side of the moon and an exploration of the lunar south pole region.

Hydrogen-powered vehicles making SW China greener
 (Xinhua) 10:31, March 25, 2024
CHONGQING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At a hydrogen refueling station on an expressway linking the city of Chengdu and Chongqing Municipality in southwest China, Yang Wenbin is refueling his hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle. Within five minutes, the tank is filled with hydrogen fuel.
""The vehicle can run more than 500 km once the tank is filled up. It's very powerful when climbing a slope with a heavy load,"" said Yang, noting that it emits only water, which is eco-friendly.
In late 2021, Chongqing cooperated with Sichuan Province to build a ""hydrogen corridor,"" which will see around 1,000 hydrogen fuel-cell logistics vehicles going into service by 2025, along with some hydrogen refueling stations being built.
Currently, more than 100 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles like Yang's are traveling between the two cities every day.
Over the past few years, a batch of facilities used to produce hydrogen and refueling stations were built and put into use. In December 2023, a major hydrogen supply center for vehicles in southwest China went operational in Chongqing.
The center can supply 6,400 kg of high-purity hydrogen per day at full capacity, enough to meet the hydrogen consumption needs of 260 hydrogen-fueled heavy-duty trucks, said Liu Huabin, deputy general manager of the Chongqing Petrochemical Sales Company of Sinopec, China's main oil refiner. The program is expected to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 27,000 tonnes per year, according to Liu.
Eyeing the potential, many enterprises in Chongqing have rolled out new car models, while key supporting enterprises have taken root there.
Qingling Motors, a Chongqing-based commercial vehicle manufacturer, is among them. To date, Qingling has sold more than 500 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
""This year, we aim to promote the research and development and sales of hydrogen-fueled heavy-duty trucks,"" said Zeng Ke, marketing director of the company, adding that the company looks to expand the market to the Yangtze River Economic Belt and regions along the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor.
With the aim of pursuing high-quality and green growth, China has announced that it will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.
