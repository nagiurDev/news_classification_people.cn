KUNMING, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Six new orchid species have been discovered in southwest China's Yunnan Province and Xizang Autonomous Region, according to the Kunming Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The findings, made by researchers from the institute, have been published recently in the journals PhytoKeys and Nordic Journal of Botany.
During several field surveys in Yunnan and Xizang in recent years, the researchers collected specimens of six previously unidentified orchid species.
Following a review of the literature, morphological studies of herbarium specimens and plastid phylogenomic analyses, they concluded that these specimens are new to the genera Neottia, Papilionanthe, Gastrochilus and Cylindrolobus.
According to the study, the Himalayan and the Hengduan Mountains are iconic biodiversity hotspots of global significance. However, the species diversity of this region remains inadequately understood.
The early floristic accounts of Xizang in 1987 recorded only 191 species in 64 genera in the Orchidaceae family. However, a number of new species were reported over the past decades, increasing the number of orchids in Xizang to 110 genera with 491 species in the latest checklist.
""Long-term and in-depth field investigations are still required to address the urgent challenge of conserving rare species in these mountainous regions as their habitats undergo rapid changes,"" said the study.
The Orchidaceae is one of the largest families of angiosperms in the world, with approximately 190 genera and 1,600 species in China. The Himalayan and the Hengduan Mountains are particularly rich in orchids.

China's MA60 firefighting aircraft moves one step closer to obtaining certification
By Hu Tao (Xinhua) 14:10, December 20, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- China's independently-developed MA60 firefighting aircraft, a new member of the Modern Ark multipurpose aircraft family, is progressing forward on its airworthiness certification process, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).
As an aircraft model tailored to serve emergency rescue missions, MA60 successfully completed a key test flight, which consisted of hedgehopping and dropping six tonnes of water, said the AVIC, China's leading aircraft manufacturer.
The aircraft successfully conducted the water drop over the scheduled site at a very low altitude of 55 meters. The test took place at an airport in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
The development and flight-test teams undertook a phased approach to carry out this flight test. They evaluated the aerial water-dropping performance of the aircraft by loading it with half of its maximum water-carrying capacity and gradually increasing it to its full capacity. Finally, they were able to complete this key flight test mission.
This success marked a breakthrough in core tech-indicators of the firefighting mission system of this special-purpose aircraft. It is a milestone of the MA60 firefighting aircraft project and lays a solid foundation for its airworthiness certification process, said the AVIC.
The development team will now accelerate follow-up flight tests for the aircraft's airworthiness compliance verification, stepping closer towards obtaining the airworthiness certification and delivering the aircraft to customers, it added.
The MA60 firefighting aircraft is a large and medium-sized fixed-wing plane model that is specially tailored to serve aerial firefighting and other emergency rescue missions, enhancing the country's emergency air rescue capabilities, said the AVIC.
It is developed by AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd. in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, with independent intellectual property rights. It is also in full compliance with the airworthiness regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
Inheriting the mature technologies and advantages of the Modern Ark aircraft family, the MA60 firefighting aircraft features a high cruising speed, long range, flight in low speeds at low altitudes and good reliability.
Furthermore, the developer has improved the aircraft's fuselage, added multiple functional systems, such as those for water-dropping and fire monitoring. It has also made a series of adaptive changes to the cabin configuration, air conditioning, oxygen supply and multiple other systems.
Notably, this new aircraft model is capable of quickly transitioning from firefighting missions to transport. Following a convenient configuration modification at airport, the aircraft can flexibly carry out both emergency rescue operations and transport tasks for both personnel and supplies. Therefore, it will play an important role in enhancing the effectiveness of disaster relief and other emergency rescue operations, according to the developer.
The comprehensive improvements and new systems empower the newly-developed MA60 firefighting aircraft to carry out multiple roles in emergency rescue.
It can effectively perform multiple rescue operations, such as aerial water dropping, airborne telecommunications support, fire prevention and monitoring, according to the developer.
Prior to the newly-developed MA60 firefighting model, the Modern Ark family has cultivated a series of aircraft models: MA60 and MA600 turboprop regional aircraft, civil freighter, and multipurpose aircraft models for precipitation enhancement and other fields, according to the developer.
By now, more than 100 aircraft of the Modern Ark family has been delivered globally and served around 300 routes at home and abroad, according to the AVIC.

2023 in review: A fruitful year for China's manned space program
By Guo Meiping (CGTN) 11:20, December 20, 2023
It has been a busy year for China's manned space program. In 2023, the country welcomed the return of its Shenzhou-15 crew, sent two manned spaceships and one cargo spacecraft to its space station and harvested fruitful scientific research results in the space.
As 2023 draws to a close, let's look back at the memorable moments of China's manned space program during the year.
The launch of the Tianzhou-6 cargo spacecraft

China launched the Tianzhou-6 cargo spacecraft on May 10, which later docked with its space station.
The primary purpose of the Tianzhou-6 was to deliver essential supplies and spacesuits to the Shenzhou-15 crew, which arrived at the space station in November 2022. The cargo craft also transported maintenance components, application facilities and propellant to support the operation of the space station.
Its successor, the Tianzhou-7 cargo craft, is scheduled to be launched in early 2024 to deliver supplies for the astronauts.
The return of the Shenzhou-15 crew
On November 29, 2022, China launched the Shenzhou-15 manned mission, which wrapped up the last stage of the construction of its space station. Since then, the China Space Station (CSS) entered a new phase of application and development, which will span more than 10 years.

(Xinhua/Wei Mengjia)
BEIJING, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese researchers used a novel theory to invent a new type of ultrathin optical crystal with high energy efficiency, laying the foundation for next-generation laser technology.
Prof. Wang Enge from the School of Physics, Peking University, recently told Xinhua that the Twist Boron Nitride (TBN) made by the team, with a micron-level thickness, is the thinnest optical crystal currently known in the world. Compared with traditional crystals of the same thickness, its energy efficiency is raised by 100 to 10,000 times.
Wang, also an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said this achievement is an original innovation by China in the theory of optical crystals, and has created a new field of making optical crystals with two-dimensional thin-film materials of light elements.
The research findings were recently published in the journal Physical Review Letters.
Laser is one of the underlying technologies of the information society. Optical crystals can realize the functions of frequency conversion, parametric amplification and signal modulation, to name a few, and are the key parts of laser devices.
In the past 60 years, the research and development of optical crystals has been mainly guided by two phase-matching theories proposed by scientists in the United States.
However, due to the limitations of traditional theory models and material systems, the existing crystals have struggled to meet the future requirements for developing laser devices, such as miniaturization, high integration and functionalization. The development of new-generation laser technology needs breakthroughs in optical crystal theory and materials.
Wang Enge and Prof. Liu Kaihui, director of the Institute of Condensed Matter and Material Physics, School of Physics, Peking University, led the team to develop the twist-phase-matching theory, the third phase-matching theory based on the light-element material system.
""The laser generated by optical crystals can be viewed as a marching column of individuals. The twist mechanism can make everyone's direction and pace highly coordinated, greatly improving the energy conversion efficiency of the laser,"" explained Liu, who is also deputy director of the Interdisciplinary Institute of Light-Element Quantum Materials at the Beijing Huairou National Comprehensive Science Center.
The research has opened up a brand-new design model and material system, and realized the original innovation of the whole chain from basic optics theory to material science and technology, he said.
""The TBN crystal's thickness ranges from 1 to 10 microns. The thickness of optical crystals we had known before is mostly at the level of a millimeter or even centimeter,"" Liu added.
The TBN production technology is now applying for patents in the United States, Britain, Japan and other countries. The team has made a TBN laser prototype and is developing new-generation laser technology with enterprises.
""Optical crystal is the cornerstone of laser technology development, and the future of laser technology is determined by the design theory and production technology of optical crystals,"" Wang said.
With ultra-thin size, excellent integration potential and new functions, the TBN crystal is expected to achieve new application breakthroughs in quantum light sources, photonic chips, artificial intelligence and other fields in the future, according to Wang.

Feature: Tanzanian institute developing vision of becoming center of excellence in fisheries research with Chinese-donated equipment
 (Xinhua) 13:07, December 19, 2023
DAR ES SALAAM, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- Researchers with the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) attached to Tanzania's Great Lakes are no longer experiencing headaches when it comes to conducting research, especially on water quality monitoring and eco-environment.
""Our research on water quality monitoring in the Great Lakes has been made easier and we are now enjoying doing it,"" Baraka Sekadende, TAFIRI director for the Mwanza center in northern Tanzania, said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
TAFIRI serves as a public institution under the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries that promotes, conducts, and coordinates fisheries and aquaculture research in Tanzania.
Sekadende said the improved efficiency in water monitoring in the Great Lakes follows the donation in April 2023 of state-of-the-art research equipment by the Chinese government through the Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology (NIGL) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Noting water quality monitoring in Lake Victoria was very important because the water was not only being used for fisheries and aquaculture but was also being used for domestic use in several regions, including Kagera, Tabora, Shinyanga, Geita, Singida, and Dodoma, she stressed the equipment has vehemently helped in monitoring water quality in Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake by area and the world's second-largest freshwater lake shared by Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.
Ismael Kimirei, the director general of TAFIRI, said at the time when the equipment was donated, TAFIRI's Mwanza branch was organizing a big sampling campaign to collect information on the suitability of more than 88 sites in Lake Victoria to conduct a strategic environmental assessment to support the Building Better Tomorrow for Livestock and Fisheries Entrepreneurs (BBT-LIFE), an initiative aimed at bolstering youth participation in livestock and fisheries entrepreneurship.
""The equipment came at the right time since they were instrumental in getting this specific task successful. The donated microscopes and spectrophotometer and deionized water generators were very helpful,"" said Kimirei.
Great outcomes have been delivered to help the strategic environmental assessment in Lake Victoria, generating very good data which are being analyzed now and which will contribute to advising the government on the best way of managing cage fish farming in Lake Victoria, he noted.
Kimirei said TAFIRI has been collaborating with NIGLAS since 2008 during which they managed to conduct many joint and mutual projects and published many research articles, some of which are currently in peer review.
He said because of this, the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries in Tanzania signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Science and Technology of China in July 2023 to cement the further relationship and establish a joint laboratory that will serve both the Chinese and Tanzanian researchers and other researchers in the Lake Victoria region.
Kimirei said TAFIRI has a vision of becoming a center of excellence in fisheries and aquaculture research in the Eastern and Southern Africa region.
""We cannot get there with rudimentary equipment,"" said the TAFIRI chief.

China's ""graphite capital"" ignites high-tech growth
 (Xinhua) 10:05, December 19, 2023
HARBIN, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- In the exhibition hall of a new-energy materials company in the city of Jixi, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, artificial diamonds shine brightly under the light.
The artificial diamonds are all made from graphite blocks in an environment of high pressure and high temperature, reaching thousands of degrees Celsius.
The graphite blocks are all from Jixi, said Lin Kunfeng, deputy general manager of the new energy materials company called Haoshi.
Jixi is one of the world's main areas for producing high-quality graphite. In 2014, the city was awarded the title of ""China's graphite capital"" by the China Mining Association.
""The high-quality graphite here, which can produce various materials like natural graphene, has unique advantages,"" said Xi Qi, director of the city's graphite industry upgrading and development service center.
Graphite, a form of carbon with the characteristics of lubrication, electrical conductivity and high-temperature resistance, is a superior mineral resource in China and is vital for the development of high-tech industries.
The city now has an annual processing capacity of 7.5 million tonnes of graphite ore, with a deep-processing product capacity of 615,000 tonnes. Jixi's annual growth rate for graphite deep-processing product output exceeded 20 percent in 2022.
The rich graphite resources in Jixi have attracted many enterprises, such as HGT, a graphite mining and processing technology company.
HGT is engaged in the processing, production and sales of graphite products, such as graphite paper and the graphite materials used to produce batteries.
""Based on the local graphite resources, our company will continue to accelerate the development of the graphite industry, optimize the industrial structure, and further research and develop the added value of industrial technology,"" said Dong Li, deputy general manager of HGT.
Jixi has 66 graphite production enterprises, 80 percent of which are deep-processing enterprises, with materials produced for energy storage, sealing, conductor and other purposes.
On sci-tech innovation, the annual Central Economic Work Conference held earlier this month urged promoting industrial innovation through sci-tech innovation, and in particular forging new industries, models and impetus with disruptive and cutting-edge technologies.

Research reveals evidence for early domestic yak on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
 (Xinhua) 09:59, December 19, 2023
XI'AN, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- Herders living at high altitudes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau started extensively raising yaks, cattle, and their hybrids around 2,500 years ago, according to recent research.
Scientists from China and the United States conducted a study exploring the origin of ancient cattle and yaks, the historical context of husbandry adapted to extreme conditions on the plateau, and the early hybridization of yak and cattle.
Genetic studies show that the current wild yak is closely related to the ancestors of domestic yak, and the cattle in the prehistoric era on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were likely brought into the region from the northwestern areas of China, as indicated by archaeological findings.
It has been observed that hybrids may adapt better to harsh environments while producing more milk and meat and exhibiting greater strength compared to cattle at high altitudes.
Scholars have also argued that herders integrated yak, cattle, and their hybrids, along with sheep, goats, and horses, to generate multiple livelihoods for obtaining meat, milk, fur, and dung for fuel.
The research offers genetic evidence to support further investigation into the domestication of yaks and the high-altitude adaptability of cattle.
The study was published in Science Advances in December.

Behind ""Hefei model"": How reforms reshape China's emerging tech hub
By Wang Xiuqiong, Li Baojie, Chen Shangying, Wang Haiyue (Xinhua) 08:16, December 19, 2023
HEFEI, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- From an ""artificial sun"" setting global records in nuclear fusion to a deep space exploration lab that supports China's moon missions and a quantum computer prototype that can solve intractable problems 10 quadrillion times faster than the world's fastest supercomputers, Hefei boasts an array of accomplishments.
An inland city much less conspicuous a decade earlier, this capital of east China's Anhui Province today stands as a thriving cluster of cutting-edge science and technology and dynamic tech-intensive industries.
The transformation came as China pressed ahead with a wide range of reforms in the past decade to make its economy more innovation-driven with a higher quality of development.

Much of the city's achievement has been attributed to what some call the ""Hefei model,"" a unique approach to fostering new industries by effectively combining the roles of state-owned capital and private enterprises.
""The 'Hefei model' is a path to better economic development for underdeveloped cities. It is the result of years of explorations by the local government, which has stricken a proper balance between the government and the market,"" said Liu Zhiying, a professor at the School of Management of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
During the past decade, Hefei's economic output surged to over 1 trillion yuan (about 140 billion U.S. dollars) from around 400 billion yuan, placing it among the fastest-growing cities in the country. Strategic emerging industries now account for more than half of its industrial output, which jumped 9.7 percent year on year in the first 10 months of 2023, the highest growth in nearly 19 months outpacing the national total.
ZOOMING INTO THE SUCCESS STORY
Deepening reform of state-owned capital management is a key part of Hefei's success story.
State capital is directly invested in leading enterprises of emerging industries that are viewed as strategically important but often considered by private investors as too risky or costly. The state capital gradually exits from these enterprises after their market prospects become clearer and they attract interest from non-government investors.
State investment returns are then used to support more projects in the industry to cultivate a resilient industrial chain. A healthy industrial ecology is developed in this process, drawing more outside investment, technologies and talent to form a virtuous cycle.

NIO, one of China's fastest-growing electric vehicle makers, secured billions of yuan of state capital investment from Hefei in 2020 when the company had been in difficulty and failed to get support from other cities as the emerging industry's outlook was clouded by uncertainties.
Nio's share prices rebounded sharply over the next several months following the bailout. The local government then sold part of its stakes and proceeded to invest in a new industrial park for smart electric vehicle manufacturing to seek sustained development of the industry.
""Hefei serves as a good example of successfully integrating an efficient market with a well-functioning government,"" said Jessie Wu, Nio's vice president in charge of industrial planning. ""The local government exited even when our share prices were continuing to rise because its purpose was to support a whole industry rather than gain more profits. The government still holds stakes but our operation is independent, without any interference from the authorities.""
As an underlying logic of deepening reforms in the past decade, China wants to ensure that the market plays a decisive role in resource allocation and the government better plays its role. This is a key part of the country's efforts to build a high-standard socialist market economy.
During the past decade, Hefei poured over 160 billion yuan of state capital into strategic emerging industries, with earnings nearing 60 billion yuan, stimulating more than 620 billion yuan of total investment, according to local authorities.
The local government has also led the creation of a ""jungle of funds"" that meet enterprises' diverse needs for investment at different stages of development, with a total scale of over 170 billion yuan and higher risk tolerance than many other cities.

Zhang Yi, Party secretary and director of Hefei's state-owned assets supervision and administration commission, said that investment choices by the state capital have been market-oriented.
Officials in charge of investment have a professional and in-depth understanding of the market and industrial trends, with external evaluation from top consulting firms and experts, due diligence and legal reviews, he added.
Some have described Hefei's administration as a ""government of investment bankers,"" a depiction acknowledged by Zhang as a positive endorsement for the performance of local state capital investment.
""We have become a bellwether of investment. If our state investment goes into certain projects, they would attract many more non-government investors,"" he said.
AN EMPOWERING BRIDGE
In addition to state capital investment, Hefei's government has carried out deeper reforms. The city has set up special municipal-level committees for advancing sci-tech innovation and fostering strategic emerging industries.
""We have to mobilize resources citywide to support these sectors as they typically need a long period of development before generating returns and face great uncertainties,"" said Yuan Fei, a member of the standing committee of the municipal Party committee and vice mayor of Hefei. ""It's like we push for physical reactions first until chemical changes occur, when they have appeal to the market.""

Covering an area bigger than 1,700 soccer fields, one of the world's largest city parks in Hefei has been turned into a gigantic testing ground for futuristic self-flying taxis, autonomous buses and drones delivering takeaways.
This is one of the ""super scenarios"" local authorities have opened for tech firms to try out new technologies before commercialization. A special agency has been established to meet the demand for application scenarios, which are often a luxury for innovative startups and researchers but important to their commercial prospects.
This year, more than 160 tech companies have already been given access to various application scenarios to pilot their technologies and products, according to the Hefei Development and Reform Commission.
""The government should be a bridge between sci-tech innovation and industrial innovation,"" said Yuan. ""We see science and technology from the perspective of how to use it to support industrial development, and development should be our top priority.""
The government organizes road shows or competitions involving innovative projects at various scales to connect them with domestic and even global investors. It has also set up over 50 R&D agencies jointly with colleges and research institutes and teams to discover and incubate their research results, cultivating over 1,400 high-tech firms so far.
Hefei's efforts to seek industrial opportunities in science and technology have paid off. It is now home to a world-class new display industry with annual output exceeding 100 billion yuan, a thriving new energy vehicle sector that attracted hefty investments from Volkswagen, and one of the country's fastest-growing chip-making clusters.

Nationwide, deepening structural reforms aimed at establishing a foundational system for all-around innovation have kicked in, helping boost China's ranking on the Global Innovation Index from 35th in 2013 to 12th this year.
Reforms in the new era are pushing local governments to focus more on creating a sound business environment and better serving enterprises and innovation rather than relying on administrative approvals, according to Liu from USTC.
According to Zepp Health, a smart wearable technology firm established in Hefei in 2013, a decade of reforms has transformed the local government from a provider of infrastructure and general policies to a more complex and upgraded role.
Local authorities have helped startups like Zepp Health get funding, talent and other resources in a consistent and prompt manner, and also demonstrated their professional knowledge and global perspective in cultivating competitive and profitable industries amid fierce market competition and great uncertainties, according to Zhang Xiaojun, co-founder and vice president of the company.
""In these terms, the government not only serves but also empowers enterprises in a multi-dimensional way,"" he said.

China to build a new telescope array in Antarctica
 (Xinhua) 13:46, December 18, 2023
SHANGHAI, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to install a new telescope array around the South Pole, and its prototype has recently completed trial operation in the frigid continent.
The new project, named Antarctic TianMu Time-domain Astronomical Observation Array, is expected to consist of 100 small-diameter, large-field telescopes in the Antarctic region, with a single one covering a 10,000-square-degree sky area.
These optical telescopes will carry out continuous observation during the polar night every year, according to their designers from the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The array's prototype was transported to China's Zhongshan Station during the country's 39th Antarctic scientific expedition. Two Chinese icebreakers kicked off the expedition in late October 2022 and traveled more than 60,000 nautical miles over 163 days.
Starting from February 20, 2023, the prototype completed trouble-free observations for 248 consecutive days and obtained a large amount of data during the Antarctic polar night.
The preliminary analysis showed that the prototype's photometric accuracy of stars brighter than 9th magnitude in images exposed for 30 seconds reached one-thousandth of a stellar magnitude, verifying the feasibility of the prototype design, said Zhou Dan, the prototype's chief engineer from SHAO.
The prototype is China's first astronomical observation equipment in Antarctica based on drift scanning charge coupled device (CCD) technology that allows the telescope to track celestial objects without a driving mechanism, according to Zhou.

Innovation drives China's high-quality economic development
By He Yin (People's Daily) 10:17, December 18, 2023
China received about 1.6 million patent applications in 2022, ranking first in the world, according to the World Intellectual Property Indicators 2023 report recently issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
According to WIPO's Global Innovation Index 2023, China ranked 12th globally, with six indicators ranking first in the world. Besides, the 24 world-level science and technology clusters in China also for the first time made China the top in the world in the relevant ranking.

All these figures prove that China, which has joined the ranks of the world's innovators, is still improving its capability in sci-tech innovation.
Innovation is the primary driving force behind development and the strategic underpinning for building a modernized economy.
Against the backdrop of a sluggish global economic recovery, China's economy has rebounded and improved. The country is making solid progress in promoting high-quality development and advancing the construction of a modern industrial system. Furthermore, significant breakthroughs have been achieved in sci-tech innovation.
According to statistics released by the National Bureau of Statistics this August, the new kinetic energy index of China's economic development (taking 2014 as 100) was 766.8 in 2022, up 28.4 percent from a year ago. The innovation-driven index was 336.3, an increase of 15.5 percent over the previous year. The knowledge capability index stood at 193.4, up 5.9 percent year-on-year.
China boasts the world's largest talent pool with the most complete categories, with the total number of talent resources reaching 220 million. The number of full-time equivalent R&D personnel is expected to surpass 6 million in 2022.
International observers said that China has continuously enhanced its capability in sci-tech innovation to support high-quality development, and promoted a virtuous cycle of academics, innovation, and production.
As innovation-driven development advances and sci-tech innovation continues to empower the real economy, new industries and new driving forces are constantly growing and expanding, thereby enhancing their role in driving economic growth.

From January to October this year, China's investment in high-tech industries increased by 11.1 percent year-on-year, outpacing overall investment by 8.2 percentage points. The industrial added value of automobile manufacturing grew by 11.3 percent, while the figure in electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing increased by 13.6 percent, compared to the same period last year.
Innovation remains at the heart of China’s modernization drive. The innovation and commercialization of new technologies have become important driving forces for economic development.
Thanks to the innovation and application of advanced technologies, the Chinese economy has constantly opened up new fields and new tracks. A number of industries with long industrial chains, high technology content, and strong driving capabilities have accelerated their development. The rapid growth in China's exports of new energy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and photovoltaic products in recent years is clear proof of this.
China will continue to be an economy that creates huge opportunities for bilateral cooperation, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance of the Republic of Singapore Lawrence Wong in Beijing. He noted that China boasts a huge economy with many advantages in areas such as advanced manufacturing and green economy, and also possesses a vast market.
Huge opportunities lie in China's fertile ground for innovation. Unilever has established its Asian R&D center in north China's Tianjin municipality; Schneider Electric has inaugurated its automation R&D center in Wuxi, east China's Jiangsu province; Honeywell has chosen Shanghai as the location for its global automotive parts R&D center; Volkswagen has announced its plan to develop and produce electric vehicles at a new base in Hefei, east China's Anhui province.
The Chinese market not only offers a large consumer base for multinational corporations, but also serves as a fertile ground for the incubation, roadshow, and promotion of new technologies and models.
More and more heads of multinational companies investing in China believe that many technological innovations originate from China first and then go to the rest of the world. China has become a breeding ground for large-scale application of emerging technologies.

China's sci-tech innovation not only provides sustained momentum for its own economic growth, but also brings tangible development opportunities to the rest of the world.
China has established sci-tech cooperation with over 160 countries and regions, and signed 116 inter-governmental agreements on sci-tech cooperation, creating a new pattern of all-round, multi-level, and wide-ranging open cooperation in the field of science and technology.
China has also signed inter-governmental agreements on sci-tech cooperation with over 80 Belt and Road countries. Together, they have established more than 50 joint laboratories, built over 20 agricultural technology demonstration centers and some 70 overseas industrial parks.
Additionally, China has set up 10 overseas science and education cooperation centers and nine transnational technology transfer centers with relevant countries.
Denis Simon, a distinguished fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies, noted that China's technological achievements are remarkable and playing an increasingly crucial role in the global innovation landscape. China has become an important participant in cutting-edge innovation on the international stage and a significant contributor to solving global challenges, Simon added.
China will continue to deeply implement the innovation-driven development strategy, integrate sci-tech innovation resources, lead the development of strategic emerging industries and future industries, accelerate the formation of new productive forces, and stimulate stronger advantages and momentum, so as to drive high-quality economic development with innovation.

Chinese researchers propose robots that swim upstream in blood
 (Xinhua) 09:57, December 18, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have proposed an on-wall-rotating strategy for untethered magnetic millirobots to move upstream in blood vessels, according to a study published in the journal IEEE Xplore.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and approximately 80 percent of CVD deaths are caused by heart attack and stroke.
Despite the many types of millirobots that have been developed for mini-invasive CVD treatment, swimming against the fast blood flow remains a massive challenge due to the lack of the ability to stay still and the large fluidic resistance from blood.
To address these problems, researchers from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have proposed a design scheme of streamlined millirobots and an on-wall-rotating strategy that is easier for clinical application.
The combined design of elliptical arc and parabola reduces the fluid resistance of the robots by approximately 58.5 percent compared to conventional robots. The on-wall motion pattern allows the robots to advance along the wall of the blood vessel where the fluid resistance is lower, further reducing the resistance by about 30.7 percent compared to the classic approach of moving in the center of the blood vessel.
To explore the clinical potential of the new strategy, the researchers tested the robot's moving ability in porcine blood vessels. They found it passed through the vessels in 26 seconds, verifying the robot's ability to move against the blood flow.

WENCHANG, Hainan, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- China's newly-launched Long March-5 rocket has for the first time used an 18.5-meter-long fairing, setting a new height benchmark for China's carrier rockets in commission.
The rocket, coded as Long March-5 Y6, blasted off at 9:41 p.m. (Beijing Time) from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the southern island province of Hainan on Friday, sending a high-orbit optical remote sensing satellite into its planned orbit.
The new fairing, which is 5.2 meters in diameter, is over 6 meters longer than the fairing of previous Long March-5 rockets, according to Zhu Haiyang, designer of the two-stage Long March-5 rocket that is developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
The longer fairing enhances the loading capacity and mission adaptability of Long March-5, and also makes its height exceed that of all Long March launch vehicles in commission.
In the next few years, the Long March-5 will enter a high-density launch cycle. The research team will further optimize the test and launch system relying on remote assistance to improve the test and launch efficiency.
The Long March-5 made its maiden flight in 2016.
