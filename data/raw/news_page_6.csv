GUIYANG, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- The construction of the Core Array of China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) started Wednesday, highlighting China's growing potential in global radio astronomy research.
As a proposed extension of FAST, the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, the Core Array integrates 24 secondary 40-meter antennas implanted within 5 kilometers of the FAST site, said Jiang Peng, deputy director of the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
The Chinese-designed array will combine the unprecedented sensitivity of FAST with a high angular resolution, thereby exceeding the capabilities at similar frequencies of next-generation arrays in the world.
The FAST Core Array is estimated to be completed and put into operation in 2027.
According to a study conducted by CAS, the Core Array will be equipped with advanced devices to improve the survey efficiency of FAST, whose broad frequency coverage and large field of view (FOV) will be essential to study transient cosmic phenomena such as fast radio bursts and gravitational wave events; conduct surveys and resolve structures in neutral hydrogen galaxies; monitor or detect pulsars; and investigate exoplanetary systems.

Jiang said that once operational, the FAST Core Array could provide more possibilities for global radio astronomy research, owing to a wide range of potential scientific applications from cosmology to exoplanet science.
Wednesday also marks the eighth anniversary of the launch of FAST. In less than a decade, FAST has already significantly expanded its astronomical observation capability, and the FAST Core Array is set to enhance its observational capabilities further.
Jiang said observations made solely with FAST are like using a pencil to draw a sketch, while the FAST Core Array is akin to capturing the night sky with a digital camera.
To date, FAST has identified more than 900 new pulsars since its launch in 2016. The number of new pulsars discovered by FAST is more than three times the total number of pulsars found by foreign telescopes during the same period.
FAST started formal operations in January 2020 and was officially opened to the world in March 2021. The telescope provides astronomers around the globe with a powerful tool to uncover the mysteries and evolution of the universe.

Since its formal opening to the global scientific community on March 31, 2021, FAST has facilitated over 900 hours of observations for research teams from 15 countries, including the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia, covering various scientific objectives.
On April 6 this year, FAST reopened applications for observation projects for the 2024-2025 season, offering 1,600 hours of telescope time for freely applied projects.
British astronomer Ralph Eatough said that opening up FAST to the world means that astronomers can now perform experiments that were previously not possible due to insufficient telescope sensitivity, with a prime example of this being the potential to detect pulsars located in external galaxies.
Chen Xianhui, an academician at CAS, said, ""FAST is helping mankind explore the origins, evolution, and structure of the universe, providing crucial observational data for understanding pressing scientific questions, while also serving as an important platform for international scientific exchange and collaboration.""

Chinese aerospace startup expects better performance in following rocket recovery tests,2024-09-25,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0925/c90000-20223263.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese aerospace startup expects better performance in following rocket recovery tests
 (Xinhua) 16:57, September 25, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese rocket startup Deep Blue Aerospace (Deep Blue) said it would carry out another high-altitude vertical recovery mission in November, after its reusable rocket Nebula-1 failed in the final stages of a test flight recently.
The oxygen/kerosene-fuelled Nebula-1, Deep Blue's first reusable launch vehicle, completed 10 of the 11 key verification tasks during its first high-altitude vertical recovery flight test on Sunday. But it experienced an anomaly in the final landing phase, leading to a fracture of the rocket body.
""There was a problem with the engine's thrust control servo tracking command, causing the rocket to land at a height exceeding its design parameters. As a safety precaution, the rocket shutdown command was triggered, resulting in partial damage to its body,"" explained Zhao Ya, Deep Blue executive president.
Despite the imperfect results, Zhao believed that the test could provide valuable data and experience, help them identify problems and deficiencies, and improve the performance and reliability of the rocket.
Other phases of the 179-second test flight were mostly perfect. The rocket performed well in the takeoff, ascent and descent stages, and touched down precisely on the center point of the recovery field.
The test showed that the overall design of Nebula-1 was successful and the reliability of its liquid oxygen/kerosene engine was also verified, said Shou Tuo, a senior aerospace industry observer.
Chinese netizens also offered generous encouragement. ""I have always felt that it is more important to get cognition, rather than the result,"" a Weibo user Cao Meng-Aerospace posted. ""Let's continue to work hard.""
Deep Blue plans to conduct a five-kilometer high-altitude vertical recovery flight mission in November, aiming to verify all pending verification items, according to Du Pengfei, chief technical designer of Nebula-1.
Based on the completion of the five-kilometer recovery test, the company will select an appropriate time to carry out a 100-kilometer vertical recovery flight test within one or two months. It is also scheduled to conduct Nebula-1's first orbital and recovery mission in the first quarter of 2025, Du said.
Nebula-1 is 3.35 meters in diameter, and its first stage is about 21 meters high. Nine liquid engines on the rocket, all independently developed by Deep Blue, were built in one piece using 3D printing technology.
It is designed to serve satellite constellation networking, space cargo supply and scientific experiments. The application of reusable rocket technology will reduce the cost of space exploration significantly, Zhao said.
""Short-term setbacks will not affect our long-term development, but will accelerate the process of technology maturity and commercialization,"" he said, ""High risk in the space field requires us to be capable of coping with failures.""
China has witnessed rapid growth of the commercial space industry since 2014, driven by the government's opening up of the sector to private capital.
According to media reports, in 2023 alone, the country's private commercial spaceflight companies managed more than 10 successful launches.
Also in 2023, developing commercial spaceflight was listed among key areas for the development of emerging industries in the government work report.
Zhuque-3, another of China's independently-developed reusable test rockets, successfully completed a 10-kilometer vertical takeoff and landing flight test on Sept. 11.
For all domestic private space companies who hope to get a share of the space market, it is of decisive significance to achieve the reuse of rockets in orbital missions, said Shou Tuo.
""It is noteworthy that newcomers in China's commercial space sector may face multiple pressures from funding, market share competition, and media attention,"" he said.

Extinct volcanoes possible abundant source of rare earth elements: Australian-Chinese research,2024-09-25,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0925/c90000-20223015.html,"Home>>
		
Extinct volcanoes possible abundant source of rare earth elements: Australian-Chinese research
 (Xinhua) 13:17, September 25, 2024
CANBERRA, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Extinct volcanoes could be a rich source of in-demand rare earth elements, joint Australian and Chinese research has found.
In a study published on Wednesday, researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) found that a type of iron-rich magma entombed within extinct volcanoes is likely abundant with rare earth elements.
Rare earth elements refer to a group of critical minerals widely used in modern electronics, defense technology, batteries and medical imaging. They are considered key to the global net-zero emissions transition because of their applications in electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.
Michael Anenburg, co-author of the study from the Research School of Earth Sciences at ANU, said the iron-rich magma that solidified to form some extinct volcanoes is up to 100 times more efficient at concentrating the elements than magmas that erupt from active volcanoes.
""We have never seen an iron-rich magma erupt from an active volcano, but we know some extinct volcanoes, which are millions of years old, had this enigmatic type of eruption,"" he said in a media release.
""Our findings suggest that these iron-rich extinct volcanoes across the globe, such as El Laco in Chile, could be studied for the presence of rare earth elements.""
To make the discovery, the team simulated volcanic eruptions by sourcing rocks similar to those from iron-rich extinct volcanoes.
The rocks were heated to melting point and their mineral content was tested, leading to the discovery of the high concentrations of rare earth elements.
Global demand for rare earth elements is expected to increase fivefold by 2030. China has the largest deposits of the elements in the world and is the world's biggest producer.
The Australian government in 2023 launched a strategy to grow the country's critical minerals sector and in May 2024 committed 566 million Australian dollars (390.8 million U.S. dollars) in funding over 10 years to map Australia's critical minerals deposits.

China's drone sector is developing rapidly, with 1.875 million drones registered nationwide as of June 2024, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) on Tuesday. Experts suggest that the widespread application of drones across various sectors is driving growth in the low-altitude economy.
As of June 2024, over 14,000 commercial drone enterprises were registered in China with more than 225,000 pilot licenses issued, according to the CAAC, as reported by CCTV News on Tuesday. From January to June this year, civil drones in China accumulated a total of 9.816 million flight hours, representing an increase of 134,000 hours compared to the same period last year.
The data was released at the 3rd China Civil UAS Development International Forum which opened in Changchun, Northeast China's Jilin Province on Tuesday.
The forum focused on regulations and the development of low-altitude flight services, analyzing policies and sharing operational practices to stimulate innovation and promote high-quality development of the low-altitude economy, according to CAAC.
Experts noted that the low-altitude economy and general aviation industry—both with substantial potential—are emerging as key areas for cultivating new growth drivers in China. Many cities are increasingly recognizing these sectors as promising ""new tracks"" for development.
""Drones are crucial for driving industry development as an emerging application. This forum will further explore topics related to drone governance and applications,"" Zhang Yi, CEO of iiMedia Research Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
According to China's Ministry of Transport, at least 29 provinces, including autonomous regions and municipalities, have included ""low-altitude economy"" in 2024 government work reports.

"China to launch moon base mission as early as 2026, expected to be equipped with wireless network",2024-09-25,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0925/c90000-20222991.html,"Home>>
		
China to launch moon base mission as early as 2026, expected to be equipped with wireless network
 (Global Times) 11:07, September 25, 2024
China's lunar exploration program will carry out two more launch missions to lay the groundwork for the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), with the first launch expected to take place as early as 2026, announced the China National Space Administration (CNSA) on Tuesday.
According to the plan, China will launch the Chang'e-7 mission in 2026 and the Chang'e-8 mission around 2028, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Tuesday.
Chang'e-7 will survey the environment and resources of the lunar South Pole, while the Chang'e-8 mission will focus on validating technologies for in-situ resource utilization on the moon, laying the foundation for the future construction of the ILRS, which is expected to be established around 2035, said Bian Zhigang, deputy director of the CNSA.
The construction of the ILRS, jointly initiated by China and Russia, will be divided into two phases.
In the first phase, a basic model of the station will be established at the lunar South Pole region, capable of conducting scientific operations within a radius of 100 kilometers. This phase will utilize an integrated information network between the Earth and the moon to enable interconnectivity and interoperability among various missions, including unmanned lunar exploration, manned lunar landings, and international cooperation. This phase will feature a comprehensive lunar research platform with essential functions.
The second phase will focus on expanding the station's capabilities, with the goal of establishing a comprehensive lunar station network by 2050. This network will be centered around the lunar South Pole station, with a lunar orbital station as the hub, and exploration nodes at the lunar equator and the far side of the moon. The station will have a large-scale, multifunctional research platform that operates continuously with long-term unmanned and short-term manned missions.
As for whether it will be possible to access the internet or live on the moon, Guan Feng, deputy director of the CNSA Lunar Exploration and Aerospace Engineering Center, revealed that the Chang'e-8 mission will consider communication capabilities.
""There will definitely be wireless networks and energy on the moon, and scientists are still researching the feasibility of growing vegetables there, an area where the Chang'e-8 mission may conduct scientific studies,"" Guan said.
In September, Senegal along with several African institutions announced their participation in the ILRS program, bringing the total number of members of the moon base to more than 10 countries and over 40 international organizations worldwide.
To date, Venezuela, Belarus, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, South Africa, Egypt, Nicaragua, Thailand, Serbia, Kazakhstan, and Senegal have joined China and Russia as part of the venture. US-based and European organizations have also joined the program, including the Hawaii-based International Lunar Observatory Association, Swiss company Nano-SPACE for Cooperation, and France's Thales Group.

"Chang’e-6 lunar samples to be open for global application, aimed at advancing moon research",2024-09-25,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0925/c90000-20222985.html,"Home>>
		
Chang’e-6 lunar samples to be open for global application, aimed at advancing moon research
By Li Yawei and Fan Anqi (Global Times) 10:49, September 25, 2024

The returner of the Chang'e-6 lunar probe is opened during a ceremony at the China Academy of Space Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation in Beijing, capital of China, June 26, 2024. The returner of the Chang'e-6 lunar probe was opened at a ceremony in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon. During the ceremony at the China Academy of Space Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, researchers opened the returner and examined key technical indicators. (Photo: Xinhua)
The first batch of lunar samples from the far side of the moon, collected by China's Chang'e-6 mission, is expected to be distributed to domestic scientists by the end of 2024, with availability for international researchers to follow. These samples are anticipated to further deepen mankind's understanding of the moon.
The CCTV news reported on Tuesday that the Chang'e-6 lunar scientific research samples will be distributed by means through an open application system. Researchers can access information and apply for the samples through the Lunar and Deep Space Exploration Scientific Data and Sample Release System on China's Lunar and Deep Space Exploration website.
Scientists around the world are keenly interested in this only batch of lunar samples, which are expected to update mankind's understanding of the Moon, Li Chunlai, deputy chief designer of the mission, told the CCTV news.
Li noted that the Chang'e-6 mission team has completed the unsealing, partitioning, processing, preparation, and preliminary analysis of the samples.
During the process of assembling the samples, the team observed that the lunar samples brought back by Chang'e-6 had more spalls than those from Chang'e-5. After preliminary analysis, scientists believe this is likely due to the fact that Chang'e-6's sampling point is located on the edge of an impact crater, which bears some relation to the spatter generated by the collision, Liu Jianjun, deputy chief commander of the ground application system of the mission, told the CCTV news.
The samples also contain a greater variety of minerals than those collected from the Chang'e-5 lunar samples, and they are of a finer texture, Liu added.
NASA spokesperson Faith McKie told the media that while China worked with the European Space Agency, and France, Italy, and Pakistan on this mission, ""NASA wasn't invited to take part in the moon probe."" NASA also didn't receive ""any direct invitation"" to study China's moon rocks, after it welcomed all scientists from around the world to apply to study them, McKie told NatSec Daily in late June.
Wang Yanan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said making such claims is ""just being ridiculous,"" as it is the US, not China, who is blocking this opportunity.
""China's application process, as announced, is wide open to global research institutes, and it never banned US participation in the research of lunar soils. However, it is the Wolf Amendment of the US that restricts any institution that receives government funding to collaborate with China in the field of space,"" Wang told the Global Times on Tuesday.
If these US institutions want to apply for the Chang'e-6 samples, they must obtain special approval from the US Congress due to the presence of this amendment, Wang explained. Currently, no such ""green light"" is in sight from Congress.
""This has excluded the vast majority of research institutions capable of lunar soil research in the US. And since most of the more capable ones are funded by the US government and therefore banned by its own laws from participating, it will significantly reduce the chances of the US to obtain the precious lunar soils,"" Wang noted.
Responding to NASA's ""sour grapes"" rhetoric, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told the Global Times in July that China is open to having space exchanges with the US, but the US side ""seems to have forgotten to mention its domestic legislation such as the Wolf Amendment. The real question is whether US scientists and institutions are allowed by their own government to participate in cooperation with China,"" Mao said.
Considering that the lunar samples are very valuable, to ensure their safety, the security measures for the storage room are comparable to those of a vault, and the entire outer layer of the room is covered with a steel plate structure, said Zhou Qin, a deputy chief designer of the ground application system of the mission.
The storage facility is a high-level clean room, where all air flowing into is purified by a filter cartridge. The room also meets high environmental requirements, maintaining a constant temperature and humidity environment, Zhou mentioned.

HONG KONG, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- China's research vessel Deep Sea No. 1, carrying manned submersible Jiaolong, received a warm welcome Tuesday in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the first time they visited the city.
The vessel is on a home-bound voyage after completing a scientific mission in the Western Pacific Ocean. During their two-day stay in Hong Kong, scientists on board will give lectures to Hong Kong students and hold a number of international seminars to share the results of this scientific expedition.
Warner Cheuk, deputy chief secretary for administration of the HKSAR government, said that the visits ahead of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China fully demonstrated the central government's care and support for Hong Kong's marine scientific research development and ecological conservation.
It is hoped that this event will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to engage in deep-sea research and make planet Earth a better place to live in, he said.
Wu Changbin, director of China Ocean Mineral Resources R&D Association, congratulated the successful completion of the Western Pacific international voyage scientific expedition, saying that this voyage not only enhanced China's scientific understanding of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystems but also contributed important scientific data to global marine scientific research.
The scientific expedition team of Chinese and foreign scientists set sail on Aug. 10 from Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province, and made a total of 18 dives in the Western Pacific. It was the first time that foreign scientists have carried out deep-sea scientific research on Jiaolong.

HONG KONG, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- China's research vessel Deep Sea No. 1, carrying manned submersible Jiaolong, received a warm welcome Tuesday in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the first time they visited the city.
The vessel is on a home-bound voyage after completing a scientific mission in the Western Pacific Ocean. During their two-day stay in Hong Kong, scientists on board will give lectures to Hong Kong students and hold a number of international seminars to share the results of this scientific expedition.
Warner Cheuk, deputy chief secretary for administration of the HKSAR government, said that the visits ahead of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China fully demonstrated the central government's care and support for Hong Kong's marine scientific research development and ecological conservation.
It is hoped that this event will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to engage in deep-sea research and make planet Earth a better place to live in, he said.
Wu Changbin, director of China Ocean Mineral Resources R&D Association, congratulated the successful completion of the Western Pacific international voyage scientific expedition, saying that this voyage not only enhanced China's scientific understanding of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystems but also contributed important scientific data to global marine scientific research.
The scientific expedition team of Chinese and foreign scientists set sail on Aug. 10 from Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province, and made a total of 18 dives in the Western Pacific. It was the first time that foreign scientists have carried out deep-sea scientific research on Jiaolong.

Guangzhou establishes international Ficus research center
 (Xinhua) 10:42, September 24, 2024
GUANGZHOU, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou International Ficus Research Center was established in the southern Chinese metropolis of Guangzhou on Monday, offering a platform for global research exchange and cooperation on the Ficus plant genus.
Located in the Dafushan Ficus Park, the center integrates research, conservation efforts and cooperative foundations related to the Ficus genus, bringing together more than 30 experts from 14 institutions across eight countries, including France, the UK and Malaysia.
During the launch ceremony, expert representatives signed a memorandum of cooperation, reaching a consensus on research, sustainable utilization, innovation and information exchange related to the genus.
Ficus species are crucial natural resources that play a key role in maintaining urban biodiversity and ecosystem functions. The timely establishment of the center provides a platform for domestic and overseas experts and scholars in the field to promote academic exchange and technology, said Finn Kjellberg, a professor at the French National Center for Scientific Research.
There are currently 877 Ficus species around the world, with 102 found in China. As an important component of Guangzhou's ecological foundations, Ficus trees play a significant role in urban greening, which enhances living environments and regulates regional climates.
There are currently 241 tree species lining streets in Guangzhou, totaling about 586,000 individual trees. Ficus species make up a significant part of that number, accounting for 276,200 trees, or 47.13 percent of the total, according to Cai Sheng, director of the Guangzhou Municipal Forestry and Landscaping Bureau.
""We have collaborated with the South China National Botanical Garden and the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden to conduct collection surveys in regions where Ficus resources are distributed, clarifying the distribution of Ficus genetic resources further,"" Cai said.

China makes vital contribution to global green development: experts
By Chu Daye (Global Times) 09:54, September 24, 2024
China is making a vital contribution to the global energy shift by providing high-quality and affordable new-energy solutions to overseas clients and investing heavily in its own green energy capacity, analysts and industry experts said on Monday, a day after the fourth anniversary of China's announcement of its ""dual carbon"" goals.
On Monday, the National Energy Administration released new data indicating that China's total installed power generation capacity expanded 14 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of this year. Solar power's cumulative power generation capacity increased by 48.8 percent to 750 million kilowatts, while wind power rose 19.9 percent year-on-year.
Sunday marked the fourth anniversary of China's pledge to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and realize carbon neutrality by 2060.
According to the China Carbon Neutrality Development Index (2024) released by the Xiamen University's Carbon Neutrality Development Index research team, in collaboration with Jiangnan University's National Security and Green Development Institute, provinces and regions in China are making progress in expanding the scale of carbon neutrality, with improvements in efficiency and quality.
Sun Chuanwang, a professor at Xiamen University leading the research, told the Global Times on Monday that measures rolled out this year have focused on continuously making improvement on the work of meeting the dual carbon goals.
Targeted action plans on the construction of a new electricity system, green data centers, the low-carbon transition of traditional industries and the reduction and elimination of fossil fuel use, rolled out in succession this year, have provided policy pathways in realizing dual carbon work during the 2021-25 period, Sun said, noting that obsolete industrial capacity is being methodically phased out and green production capacity is rapidly accumulating.
In addition to making steady headway domestically, China is also now the main driving force behind global green production, shaping the industrial transition and also fostering the green transition globally, industry insiders said.
Qian Jing, vice president of Chinese photovoltaic giant Jinko Solar, told the Global Times on Monday that China has been a strong contributor to global green development, boosting economic development and creating jobs by nurturing industrialization in many countries in the Middle East and Africa.
""In some parts of Africa, electricity is so expensive that industrialization is unthinkable,"" Qian said. ""For instance, in Ethiopia, electricity is billed at about $2 per kilowatt hour, so developing industries is very challenging. The solar-plus energy storage solution offered by Chinese solar companies can effectively bring down that cost to less than $1, making developing the local economy possible.""

Robotaxis — arriving at a future near you

Self-driving vehicles are navigating from science fiction movies to the streets of large Chinese cities, overcoming obstacles and uncertainty as they enter everyday use.
The fast-evolving technology first made headlines in China almost a decade ago. In 2015, Swedish carmaker Volvo organized a test of its hands-free vehicles traveling at 70 kilometers per hour on Beijing's Sixth Ring Road.
Chinese technology giant Baidu set up its intelligent driving group in 2017, unveiling its Apollo autonomous driving plan the same year. Pony.ai, founded by former Baidu engineers, established its first autonomous driving research and development center in 2016.
By late February, more than 20 cities had put in place policies supporting autonomous driving tests, issuing licenses to over 60 companies.
Progress had been generally going smoothly until July, when a short video went viral on social media of one of Baidu's Apollo Go driverless vehicles hitting a scooter in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province.
Baidu was quick to explain that the accident was because the scooter driver had run a red light when the driverless vehicle started to move.
Despite the accident being a minor one, as shown in the footage, it ignited complaints from local drivers and residents.
Apollo Go's Chinese name is Luobo Kuaipao, which literally means ""robots run fast"". But in Wuhan, they are called ""dumb robots"", as more footage emerged showing their mishaps.
One driverless vehicle is seen stopping on the road in front of an empty plastic bag, causing a traffic jam. In another video, two vehicles are seen braking to face each other, and not knowing what to do next.

Safety questioned
But safety is the real concern. When that vehicle in Wuhan failed to see the scooter, local residents started to doubt the safety and reliability of driverless vehicles, as manufacturers have long claimed they are safer than human drivers.
At an event in May, Baidu's vice-president, Wang Yunpeng, said the number of insurance claims of its Apollo Go vehicles over the past two years was one-fourteenth of that for human drivers.
In the second quarter of this year, Baidu's Apollo Go provided about 899,000 rides for passengers, up 26 percent year-on-year. As of July 28, the cumulative rides provided to the public by Apollo Go surpassed 7 million, the company said in its latest financial results.
The safety level of autonomous driving is 10 times that of manned driving, according to Pony.ai vice-president, Zhang Ning. The company had conducted 3.5 million km of driverless testing globally as of May this year.
However, a robotaxi doesn't have a quick solution when an injured passenger or road user needs help and needs to wait until the fleet operator sends someone to the scene.
If the accident is a minor one, the insurance company can try to settle and offer a certain amount of money.
However, the issue becomes muddier in the case of a more severe accident that causes injury or death and entails prison time.
It is likely the fleet company will be held accountable, but it is unclear who would be sent to jail — the software engineer, the CEO, the company owner, or possibly more than one of them.
Fresh pickup lines
Taxi drivers are also complaining that robotaxi firms are stealing their customers by offering generous subsidies.
A receipt for a 28-km, 64-minute robotaxi trip in Wuhan showed that the fare was just 26.52 yuan ($3.65 yuan), much cheaper than a normal taxi fare. But a closer look revealed that it had a discount of 109.52 yuan.
Wuhan has over 3,300 km of roads eligible for robotaxis, the longest in China. Robotaxis booked 850,000 rides in the first half of this year, more than for the whole of 2023, according to a Hubei Daily report.
In July, an Apollo Go vehicle booked up to 20 rides in one day, the same amount as a regular taxi, according to Shanghai-based news portal Jiemian.
There are around 400 Apollo Go vehicles in Wuhan, said Baidu CEO Robin Li. ""Our fleet accounts for just 1 percent of Wuhan's total taxi fleet. It may take quite some time, even many years, to grow (the proportion),"" said Li.
William Li, founder and CEO of NEV startup Nio, has sided with the taxi drivers.
He said that the goal of technology such as smart driving is to alleviate the burden of driving, and not to steal jobs from low-income earners. ""It is not a very inspiring story. We will never do robotaxis,"" he said.
Nio has been investing heavily in driving-assist functions, and is one of the first carmakers in the world to adopt the latest Nvidia chips made for such features.
Gu Dasong, executive director of the Southeast University's Research Center for Transportation Law and Development, said robotaxis might reduce the need for commercial drivers, such as taxi drivers and freight drivers, to some extent over the long term.
However, the move to robotaxis will profoundly transform the labor market, with new job opportunities arising from such services.
 
Congestion concern
Baidu insists that robotaxis, if applied at a city level, can solve problems such as traffic jams and road accidents.
However, as long as there are drivers and robotaxis on the road at the same time, reduced congestion and collision-free motoring will not happen, analysts said.
Robotaxis tend to be good at following traffic rules and staying alert, but human drivers sometimes cut lanes and don't always focus on road conditions, they added.
Zhang Xiang, an auto analyst at North China University of Technology, said it will take at least 10 years for large-scale business operations of robotaxis to come to fruition.
Besides technological glitches that need to be improved, robotaxis now in operation attracts customers who are not in a hurry and who want to have a novel experience.
Unlike regular taxis, they pick up and drop off passengers at fixed stops. They also have more conservative rules about road safety, and operate slower than regular taxis.
Robotaxis may suit customers who want to be left alone. But they may not be attractive to out-of-town visitors who want recommendations about a city from the driver. However, they remove the potential of a driver taking an unnecessary detour to charge more.
Business sense
Despite the teething problems, robotaxis will soon make sense commercially. Baidu said with decreasing hardware costs and increasing orders, Apollo Go is expected to become profitable by 2025.
Apollo Go loses almost $11,000 a car annually in Wuhan, Haitong International Securities estimated. A lower-cost driverless model could enable a per-vehicle annual profit of nearly $16,000, the securities firm said.
Chen Zhuo, Apollo Go's general manager, said the firm would become ""the world's first commercially profitable"" autonomous-driving platform.
Pony.ai is confident about the sector's prospects as well. In a 160 square kilometers designated zone in Beijing's E-Town, a national-level economic-technological development area, the company operates nearly 100 robotaxis.
Compared to years ago, the rides are much smoother with no abrupt braking, and the vehicles run in a similar way to other taxi services.
Pony.ai aims to increase its single-city robotaxi fleet tenfold by 2025 or 2026, said the company's vice-president, Zhang, in an interview with Xinhua.
""We've now come to the stage where it is possible to reduce costs on a larger scale of commercialization,"" he said. ""As long as the robotaxi fleet reaches above 1,000 in one city, we will be able to break even in operation (terms).""
Pony.ai is teaming up with Japanese carmaker Toyota to roll out new-generation vehicles. They will have pre-installed autonomous driving technology, making production more efficient.
""Five or six years ago, most people doubted whether autonomous driving could take root in China. There are no such doubts now,"" Zhang said.
Attracting financing
Investor interest is also fueling the sector's progress.
Pony.ai has secured more than $1.4 billion of financing from both domestic and foreign investors since 2017. The company was valued at $8.5 billion as of October last year.
The investment environment for the industry has been improving since last year, despite fluctuations in previous years, according to the company.
WeRide, based in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, plans to offer 6.45 million American depositary shares at a price range of $15.50 to $18.50 in its upcoming initial public offering, according to a company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in August.
The company reported revenue of 401.8 million yuan in 2023. For the first six months of this year, its revenue was 150.3 million yuan, according to the filing.
WeRide generates most of its revenue from sales of its Level 4 autonomous driving vehicles, ""primarily including robobuses, robotaxis and robosweepers, and related sensor suites; and … the provision of L4 autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance system services, including the provision of L4 operational and technical support services as well as ADAS research and development services"", the filing said.
The Society of Automotive Engineers International defines six levels of automation from Level 0 to Level 5. Level 4 means the vehicle can operate itself in most circumstances, while L5, also known as full driving automation, requires no human participation.
All of China's robotaxi companies are working on Level 4 vehicles.
World-leading growth
Global consulting firm McKinsey& Company has forecast that China will become the world's largest market for self-driving vehicles, with revenue from such vehicles and mobility services exceeding $500 billion by 2030.
""We've seen an acceleration in China. There's certainly now a rapid pace of permits being issued,"" said Boston Consulting Group managing director Augustin Wegscheider. ""The US has been a lot more gradual.""
Alphabet's Waymo is the only United States firm operating unmanned robotaxis that collects fares.
The company has about 700 cars operating in San Francisco and Los Angeles in California, Phoenix in Arizona, and Austin, Texas, but not all of them are in service at all times.
Cruise, backed by General Motors, restarted testing in April after one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian last year. Cruise said it operates in three cities, with safety its core mission.
""There's a clear contrast between US and China"" with robotaxi developers facing far more scrutiny and higher hurdles in the US, former Waymo CEO John Krafcik said in an interview with Reuters.
China will operate the world's largest robotaxi fleet of about 12 million self-driving vehicles by 2040, followed by the US with around 7 million, according to a report by research company BloombergNEF.
Li Hengyu, vice-president of Pony.ai and head of its robotruck business unit, said: ""The central and local governments in China rank first in the world in terms of their openness and understanding of autonomous driving.""
China has also been stepping up efforts to integrate vehicles, roads, and cloud computing, which is a crucial step in growing smart vehicles into smart cities.
In July, five ministries, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Transport, issued a notice to identify 20 cities or city clusters, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as pilot areas for the technology.
