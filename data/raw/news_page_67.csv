"Building neutrino telescope 3,500 meters under sea",2024-01-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0110/c90000-20120366.html,"Home>>
		
Building neutrino telescope 3,500 meters under sea
 (Xinhua) 16:57, January 10, 2024
SHANGHAI, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are working for an ambitious goal: building a powerful telescope at 3,500 meters underwater to detect neutrinos, which can help uncover long-standing mysteries such as the origin of cosmic rays.
One of the most abundant subatomic particles, neutrinos rarely interact with matter and can escape from dense celestial environments, unlike photons or electrons. So, neutrinos are better carriers to preserve the secrets of stars, black holes, and even the whole universe, but they are hard to detect.
The underwater telescope, dubbed the Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT), innovatively observes the cosmos by ""looking down"" instead of ""looking up"" at the sky, said Xu Donglian, the telescope's chief scientist from the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute under the Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
He explained that the TRIDENT utilizes the entire Earth as a shield when capturing high-energy neutrinos penetrating from the other side of the globe and achieves detections without a dead angle through Earth rotation.
According to a related paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy last October, the location of the TRIDENT is on an abyssal plain near the equator in China's sea area. About 4 km in diameter, it will cover an area of some 12 square km and has a design life of 20 years.
The telescope under construction will comprise 1,200 cables, which are anchored vertically on the seabed like giant seaweed, each about 700 meters long and 70 to 110 meters apart from each other, Xu said, adding that every cable has an array of about 20 glass balls, each twice the diameter of a football.
""The function of the glass balls is to detect light signals emitted by the reaction of neutrinos with seawater, so as to deduce the nature of neutrinos,"" Xu said. He explained that the particles travel through the universe like ghosts, and can only be observed indirectly when they pass through transparent mediums like glaciers and water.
A similar foreign neutrino detector is the IceCube Neutrino Observatory deployed near the South Pole. Compared with this glacier facility, the TRIDENT in the deep sea will perform much better as clean water with fewer impurities is better for observation.
However, building such a gigantic telescope in water is extremely difficult. As planned, the TRIDENT will be built in two phases. Starting at the end of 2022, the phase I construction will be completed in 2026. A tiny detector with 10 cables could capture neutrinos in the Earth's atmosphere by then.
The ultimate TRIDENT will be built around 2030 and can monitor seawater, that reacts with high-energy neutrinos, with a volume reaching about 7.5 cubic km. It is expected to become the world's most advanced neutrino telescope, Xu said.
As expected, the TRIDENT will capture steady neutrino sources from NGC 1068, a galaxy in the constellation Cetus, within a year of operation. The telescope is also expected to find the answer to the century-long mystery: where the cosmic rays that have been discovered for more than 100 years come from.
China has deployed multiwavelength telescopes, gravitational wave observatories, and an underground neutrino observatory in Jiangmen, and the new underwater neutrino telescope will massively improve the country's observation network in multi-messenger astronomy, said Jing Yipeng, head of the TRIDENT project.

"""Lobster eyes"" in sky, a major breakthrough in China's space science technology",2024-01-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0110/c90000-20120356.html,"Home>>
		
""Lobster eyes"" in sky, a major breakthrough in China's space science technology
 (Xinhua) 16:50, January 10, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's newly launched X-ray astronomical satellite Einstein Probe (EP) has adopted a cutting-edge technology inspired by the functioning of lobster's eyes, marking a breakthrough for China in the field of space science.
The EP has been built by an international collaborative effort led by China. The European Space Agency and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany jointly participated in the development of the project. The French Space Agency provided VHF (very high frequency) antennas for the EP.
Shaped like a double-pistiled lotus flower with 12 petals blooming in space, the EP is designed to detect outbursts in the universe at X-ray wavelengths. Each ""petal"" is a special X-ray telescope. On each ""petal"" there are 36 microporous imagers, each containing nearly one million square holes thinner than a single strand of hair.
Yuan Weimin, the principal investigator of the EP, said that making an X-ray telescope capable of focusing and wide-field imaging is very tricky.
""That's because X-ray photons have very short wavelengths and high energies. They are extremely penetrating and easily interact with atoms, making it difficult to focus them through refraction or reflection like visible light,"" said Yuan, who is also a researcher at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC).
""If you throw a stone into the water, the stone is too heavy and will sink to the bottom, but if you throw the stone against the water at a very small angle, the stone can bounce off the surface. Similarly, if an X-ray forms a very small angle with a reflective surface, then it is possible for the X-ray to form a reflection. This reflection can then be used to focus and create an image,"" Yuan said.
In this regard, scientists have taken inspiration from the unique eye structure of lobsters, first proposed by American astronomer Roger Angel.
Biologists discovered early on that the lobster's eye is different from that of other animals. Lobster eyes are made up of numerous tiny square tubes, which point to the same spherical center. This structure allows light from all directions to reflect in the tubes and converge on the retina. This gives the lobster a large field of view. Scientists simulated the lobster eye to create a telescope that detects X-rays in space.
Through cooperation with other organizations, the X-ray Imaging Laboratory of NAOC began the research and development work on lobster-eye X-ray imaging technology in 2010.
""After years of efforts, we finally made a technological breakthrough,"" said Zhang Chen, assistant to EP's principal investigator.
The team carried out the validation testing of the technology on the telescope Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) -- a pathfinder of the EP instrument -- which was launched in July 2022. The tests revealed the world's first batch of large-field X-ray snapshots of the sky captured by the LEIA.
According to Zhang, the previous X-ray telescopes only had a field of view roughly the size of the Moon as seen from Earth, while the field of view of the EP could be as large as about 10,000 Moons.
For the first time, large field-of-view whole-sky monitoring and X-ray focusing and imaging have both been realized at the same time, which allows for efficient monitoring of the X-ray changes of celestial bodies, Zhang added.
Moreover, the EP also pioneers in installing CMOS sensors, which can process with good spectral resolutions and fast speed. ""We have realized the application of CMOS sensors to X-ray astronomical observations in space. It is an innovation in X-ray astronomy detection technology,"" said Ling Zhixing, a scientist of the NAOC.
The EP, launched on Tuesday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province, once again bolstered the country's fleet of space science satellites in the vast expanse of space, which includes the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, the Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope, and the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory.
""While Europe, the United States and Japan have been developing space science for more than half a century, space science in China is still in its initial stage of development. However, we have made rapid progress over the past 20 years and have entered the international forefront in certain fields,"" Yuan added.
The lobster-eye telescope technology will revolutionize monitoring of the X-ray sky, and shows the strong scientific potential of the Einstein Probe mission, said Paul O'Brien, head of Astrophysics, School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester.

China launched a cutting-edge orbital telescope on Tuesday afternoon to try to capture traces of fleeting phenomena and give scientists more knowledge about black holes.
The Einstein Probe, a space-based X-ray telescope, was launched by a Long March 2C carrier rocket that lifted off at 3:03 pm from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in Southwest China's Sichuan province, and then placed in a low-Earth orbit.
It is the latest space science satellite developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, following the Mozi quantum science satellite, the Wukong dark matter particle explorer, the Insight Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope and several other spacecraft.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences' National Astronomical Observatories said the Einstein Probe is dedicated to time-domain high-energy astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy. The satellite has two payloads: the Wide-field X-ray Telescope and the Follow-up X-ray Telescope.
Its primary goals are to discover and characterize cosmic X-ray transients, particularly faint, distant and rare X-ray transients, in large numbers; discover and characterize X-ray outbursts from otherwise normally dormant black holes; and search for X-ray sources associated with gravitational-wave events and precisely locate them.
The observatories said the mission will address some of the key questions in astrophysics and cosmology, such as the prevalence of massive black holes in the universe and how they formed and evolved, the astrophysical origins and underlying processes of gravitational wave events, and the progenitors and processes of supernovas.
The European Space Agency and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany have participated in the project.
The ESA provided support for the testing and calibrating of the detectors and optical elements of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope, and also helped develop and test the mirror assembly and electron diverter of the Follow-up X-ray Telescope.
Its ground stations will be used to help download data from the spacecraft throughout the mission, the European agency said.
The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics contributed some components and test facilities to the project.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- The first U.S. private moon landing mission suffered an anomaly following its launch from the U.S. state of Florida early Monday.
A new rocket developed by U.S. space launch company United Launch Alliance lifted off at 02:18 a.m. Eastern Time (0718 GMT) Monday from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.
The launch vehicle dispatched Peregrine, the lunar lander developed by the American private company Astrobotic Technology, on its mission to the moon.
Shortly after separating from the spacecraft, Peregrine experienced a propulsion issue.
""After successful propulsion systems activation, Peregrine entered a safe operational state. Unfortunately, an anomaly then occurred, which prevented Astrobotic from achieving a stable sun-pointing orientation,"" the company said in a release.
According to NASA, the privately designed and developed spacecraft uses novel, industry-developed technology, some of which has never flown in space.
NASA is working with Astrobotic to determine the impact of the agency's five science investigations aboard Peregrine.
The five NASA science and research payloads aboard the lander will help the agency better understand planetary processes and evolution, search for evidence of water and other resources, and support long-term, sustainable human exploration, according to NASA.
Peregrine was the first American commercial lunar lander to launch on a mission to the moon.

Chinese researchers publish single cell spatio-temporal map of human limb development,2024-01-09,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0109/c90000-20119640.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers publish single cell spatio-temporal map of human limb development
 (Xinhua) 09:15, January 09, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have published a single cell spatio-temporal map of human limb development, shedding light on the cell evolution path and the determination process of cell spatial position in fetal limbs.
Human limbs emerge during the fourth post-conception week as mesenchymal buds, and would develop into fully formed limbs over the subsequent months. This process is orchestrated by numerous temporally and spatially restricted gene expression programs.
Despite decades of work with model organisms that have defined the fundamental mechanisms underlying vertebrate limb development, an in-depth characterization of this process in humans has yet to be performed.
A research team led by Zhang Hongbo, a professor at the Zhongshan School of Medicine at Sun Yat-sen University, innovatively used single cell transcriptome technology and single cell spatial transcriptome technology, making it possible to explore the cell evolution process.
The researchers sampled embryos successively from the beginning of the fifth post-conception week to the ninth post-conception week, and obtained more than 100,000 cells, each with about 2,000 genes. Through calculation and analysis, the team took the lead in creating a fine single cell map of human limb development including all cell types.
They then obtained the characteristics of each cell, discovered key genes, and located these genes to the path of cell evolution through DEAPLOG, an independently developed tool to perform differential expression analysis for cell clusters and other conditions.
Using this map, they can track the cell types produced at specific times and regions directly, identify entirely new cell types, and characterize the key genes activated by different kinds of cells, according to Zhang.
The study has been published in the journal Nature.

HONG KONG, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) announced on Monday that its research team, collaborating with the University of Oxford, recently uncovered a novel molecular mechanism that leads to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
According to researchers from CUHK, ALS is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that impacts the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness, loss of coordination and ultimately respiratory failure. To date, ALS remains incurable.
To identify ALS therapeutic targets, the research team led by Edwin Chan Ho-yin, a professor from the School of Life Sciences at CUHK, studied the underlying mechanisms of gene transcriptional control in ALS.
The team demonstrated that the function of a transcriptional factor YY1 is perturbed in ALS patient spinal motor neurons, which subsequently induces a pathway and consequently leads to neuronal cell death. This offers additional mechanistic insights into ALS pathogenesis.
Chan said that elucidating the underlying disease mechanisms will not only allow researchers to better understand ALS pathogenesis but, more importantly, will also direct the development of new drug candidates against this devastating neurodegenerative condition.
The research findings have been published in the scientific journal Nature Communications.

Chinese, U.S. scientists develop revolutionary graphene semiconductor
 (Xinhua) 15:26, January 08, 2024
TIANJIN, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- A collaborative team of Chinese and U.S. scientists have created a viable semiconductor with an on-off switch made of graphene, a carbon material far superior to silicon in terms of its electronic potential.
Graphene, a two-dimensional material made up of just a single layer of carbon atoms, is currently considered to be the most promising electronic material in this field.
However, graphene's zero bandgap structure, resulting in no energy difference when electrons in semiconductors jump between low and high energy zones, previously prevented it from being used to represent 1's and 0's in the electronic computing system.
The researchers from Tianjin University and Georgia Institute of Technology have successfully managed to open the bandgap by producing a graphene on single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC) substrates with a bandgap of 0.6 eV.
In addition, room temperature mobilities of the graphene developed by the two research teams is 10 times greater than that of silicon, according to the study published recently in the journal Nature.
Therefore, it is chemically, mechanically and thermally robust and can be synthesized with conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques, said the researchers.
Moore's Law, stating that computing power doubles every two years, has been challenged by a slowing pace in recent times. This slower pace is due to the extreme difficulties experienced in trying to reduce the size of silicon-based chips to less than two nanometers.
The two-dimensional graphene semiconductor could open up a new path for high-performance electronic devices beyond traditional silicon-based tech, heralding a fundamental change in electronics, said Ma Lei, the paper's corresponding author from Tianjin University.

GUANGZHOU, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese and German collaborative team developed a soft tiny robot with a spring-like structure that can sense, grasp and move.
The biocompatible machine capable of manipulating in a single cell offered a potential strategy in precision medicine, such as microsurgery and targeted drug delivery, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.
The researchers from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden, and Chemnitz University of Technology, fabricated the magnetic spring system, an extremely sensitive one that can deform at a micron scale driven by minuscule strain.
The robot was inspired by some cells and microorganisms that use biological springs to perform actions such as sensing, predation, and driving.
""The system in a nanoscale size shows a sensitivity equivalent to one-thousandth of the gravity of a single cell,"" said Xu Haifeng from the SIAT, the corresponding and first author of the paper.
The spring-like robot can be customized into any shape and used as a sperm motility sensor, tweezer for cell manipulation, and self-driven miniature machine.
