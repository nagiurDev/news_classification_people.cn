UN-Habitat, Chinese University report offers lessons on alleviating urban water challenges
 (Xinhua) 11:11, February 29, 2024
NAIROBI, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Developing nations should increase knowledge-sharing and partnerships with rapidly growing economies like China to alleviate water challenges in their urban areas amid rapid urbanization, according to a joint report released Tuesday during the ongoing Sixth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6) in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.
The report, jointly released by UN-Habitat and China's Tongji University, notes that many developing countries, especially those in Africa, are increasingly becoming water scarce due to the crisis of climate change and poor waste management.
Titled ""Sustaining urban water supply under climate change: Lessons from selected rapidly growing cities in Southern Africa and China,"" the report presents evidence on the impacts of climate change and rapid urbanization on water supply in four Southern African cities, namely Bulawayo (Zimbabwe) Gaborone (Botswana), Lusaka (Zambia) and Windhoek (Namibia) and offers solutions from Shanghai in China.
According to the report, over the last century, global water use has grown more than twice as fast as the global population. Combined with more volatile and uncertain supplies, this will exacerbate conditions in water-stressed areas and create water stress in currently water-rich regions.
The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 estimates that by 2050, some 685 million people will live in more than 570 cities and could face a decline in freshwater availability of at least 10 percent as a result of climate change.
As the leading author, Li Fengting of Tongji University and a fellow of the African Academy of Sciences, said that Shanghai's high population and rapid economic development constitute a strain on the water supply system.
""To maintain quality water supply and meet the needs of the population, the city has developed strategically in terms of infrastructure, management and policies in the past decades. Shanghai adopted, for the most part, advanced treatment processes based on ozonation and biologically activated carbon adsorption to deal with emerging pollutants,"" Li said.
Mutinta Munyati, Human Settlements officer at the UN-Habitat Regional Office for Africa, said sound use of data and science in guiding the planning and management of water supplies in China is a lesson African cities should borrow and complement them with enabling policies and enforcement.
Munyati observed that the rapid urbanization of Africa is affecting the capacity of cities to effectively respond to their water demand. And with the urban water demand growing exponentially at a time when climate change is exacerbating the situation, Africa is facing great challenges, she added.
UN-Habitat Regional Office for Africa Director Oumar Sylla said the report reviews the effectiveness of practical responses and solutions that are helping or could help these cities avert an imminent crisis of water supply.
""UN-Habitat therefore released the publication with Tongji University to help city councils, residents and water utilities learn from each other the strategies or approaches being used to tackle shared problems, thus facilitating the dissemination of best practices,"" Sylla said, adding that it also help central governments better appreciate real challenges faced by their cities and see how best to support the councils and utilities to tackle them.

U.S. private lunar lander continues to generate solar power on Moon
 (Xinhua) 11:02, February 29, 2024
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. company Intuitive Machines' first lunar lander Odysseus continued to generate solar power on the Moon, the company said Wednesday morning.
The solar power allowed flight controllers to continue gathering data from the south pole region on the Moon in furtherance of the IM-1 Mission objectives, said the company.
Flight controllers were analyzing new solar charging data and using the additional time to maximize tasks that would further the exploration, according to the company.
The company said on Tuesday the lander's battery may continue up to an additional 10 to 20 hours.
Intuitive Machines and NASA will have a briefing on the mission at the Johnson Space Center in Houston later Wednesday.
The uncrewed lander landed at the lunar South Pole last Thursday, marking the first American spacecraft to land on the lunar surface in more than 50 years.
Although the Odysseus touched down on lunar surface, analysis of data by flight engineers showed the six-legged spacecraft tripped over its own feet during its final descent. The spacecraft was believed to have caught one of its landing feet on the uneven lunar surface, and came to rest sideways.
Flight controllers were working on final determination of battery life on the lander, according to the company.
Odysseus carries NASA science and other commercial payloads to the moon.
The last U.S. moon landing mission was made in December 1972, when Apollo 17 touched down on the lunar surface for the final mission of the Apollo Program.

Greater international cooperation is needed to formulate unified global 6G technology standards â€” and any attempt to form small groups to limit China's influence in next-generation wireless technology will only harm the interests of the global telecommunications industry, experts said on Wednesday.
The comments came after a group of 10 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, announced on Monday that they have endorsed a set of principles to underpin the development of secure and resilient 6G networks.
The move came as the research and development of 6G enters a crucial time window to identify critical technologies and formulate key standards.
Dong Yifan, an assistant research fellow at the Institute of European Studies at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said this is the latest example of how US-led developed countries want to unite with their allies for a bigger say in formulating standards of 6G.
""They have lost their edge in 5G and (now) they want to regain their strength in 6G, which has turned into a key battleground for innovation and industrial transformation,"" Dong said.
""This is a typical US practice of forming a small group to contain China's weight in the international telecom arena, which will, in fact, slow down the development of the entire global telecommunications technology, given China's unparalleled advantage in the telecom industry.""
China has built the world's largest 5G network, which boasted more than 800 million mobile subscribers at the end of 2023, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
China also accounts for 42 percent of the global declared patents that are essential to 5G technology standards, the largest share in the world, the ministry added.
China Galaxy Securities said in a research note that in the telecom industry, countries with core advantages in the previous-generation wireless technology are more likely to gain advantages in next-generation technology, thereby achieving further technological leadership and promoting healthy industry development.
In sharp contrast to the US government's closed mindset, China's top industry regulator has highlighted that 6G requires consensus and close cooperation from all parties involved in the global industry, academia, research and applications.
Zhang Yunming, vice-minister of industry and information technology, said in a 6G telecom conference in December that more efforts are needed to deepen international cooperation to promote the formulation of unified 6G global standards.
Several Chinese as well as foreign telecom and smartphone companies have participated in China's 6G technical trials and tests in 2023, as 6G is moving from a concept to a crucial stage of potential technological breakthroughs, said Wang Zhiqin, head of the IMT-2030 (6G) Promotion Group, a government-affiliated flagship platform for promoting 6G and international cooperation in the country.
Wang said Shanghai Nokia Bell, Ericsson, China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, Huawei, ZTE, Vivo and Inspur have participated in China's 6G technical trials and tests in 2023.
China's 6G development adheres to the principle of open cooperation, strengthens international exchanges and has inked cooperation agreements with partners in South Korea, Europe and India, she said.
In June, the International Telecommunication Union approved a 6G vision framework, a foundational document for global 6G work, pressing the start button for renewed research and development across the world.
China Unicom is working hard to explore key potential technologies for 6G. The company expects to complete technical research and explore early application scenarios for 6G technology by 2025. The commercial launch of 6G in China is expected to begin from 2030, according to China Unicom.
Earlier this month, China Mobile, the world's largest telecom carrier by mobile subscribers, successfully launched the world's first satellite to test 6G architecture, marking a milestone in its efforts to explore integrated space and ground communication technology.
The low-earth orbit test satellite is the world's first to employ 6G design architecture, and was jointly developed by China Mobile and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Innovation Academy for Microsatellites.
Yang Guang, senior chief analyst at the global market research company Omdia, said: ""China believes that mobile networks are important infrastructure that need to be built ahead of schedule. Once the road is ready, cars will come naturally. The underlying condition is that Chinese operators are all state-owned enterprises and need to bear considerable social responsibility.""
But European and US telecom operators are private enterprises, and their first consideration is financial performance and their current objective is primarily to reduce costs, Yang said.

China develops brain implant enabling patient to control computer cursor movement,2024-02-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0228/c90000-20138569.html,"Home>>
		
China develops brain implant enabling patient to control computer cursor movement
 (Xinhua) 16:41, February 28, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Reflected in the intense gaze of a 35-year-old man with tetraplegia, a red ball responds to the man's thoughts and moves slowly across a screen toward a blue ball target, eventually approaching and overlapping it.
This is not a scene from a science fiction movie, but the result of a recent breakthrough China has made in the brain-machine interface field.
A team led by professor Hong Bo at Tsinghua University, in collaboration with a team led by professor Jia Wang at the Beijing Tiantan Hospital under Capital Medical University, was recently successful in helping the patient use his mind to control cursor movement on a screen.
The patient has had an injury in the C3-C4 cervical spinal segments from a car accident five years ago, resulting in the complete loss of self-care abilities. With the informed consent of the patient and his family, Jia's team last December performed a minimally invasive, wireless brain-machine interface implantation surgery using an implantable Neural Electronic Opportunity (NEO) device.
""To protect the patient's nerve cells from damage, we placed the electrodes outside the dura mater responsible for motor and sensory functions around the central sulcus of the brain during surgery,"" Jia said.
Through multiple comparisons and verifications made using advanced techniques such as intraoperative navigation, neurophysiological monitoring and mixed reality imaging, the team ensured the precise positioning of the electrodes, as well as clear and stable electrical signals in the brain. The patient was discharged 10 days after the surgery, according to Jia.
The NEO device utilizes near-field wireless power supply and signal transmission, meaning the implant is battery-free. The research team guided the patient through wireless brain-machine interface-assisted rehabilitation remotely.
After two months of careful training, the patient's motor skills recovered the extent that he was able to complete tasks such as fetching a bottle of water using an air-filled glove driven by brain waves, and he also accomplished thought-controlled cursor movement on a computer screen in a normal household environment.
""The 'chasing' of the red ball by the blue ball, seemingly a simple movement, signifies the interaction between the patient and electronic devices through the brain-machine interface, paving the way for more profound functionalities in the future,"" Jia said.
This achievement has been attributed to the precise implantation of the electrodes, and to the efficient transmission and accurate decoding of brain signals -- the result of the strong cooperation between the two teams.
Hong said that the team is continually optimizing brain-machine interface decoding algorithms. It is planning to help patients achieve control in actions such as flipping through an e-book or clicking a cursor using their minds, aiming to enhance interactive patient-device capabilities.
The successful implantation of the minimally invasive, wireless brain-machine interface and the first successful brain-controlled cursor movement are expected to provide a new direction for the rehabilitation of patients with tetraplegia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurological disorders, offering new possibilities to many people hoping to restore their physiological functions.
It is understood that the minimally invasive, wireless brain-machine interface project was initiated by Tsinghua University in 2016, followed by the manufacturing of a prototype device in 2019 and the commencement of animal experiments in 2020. At the end of 2021, Beijing Tiantan Hospital joined the project, participating in the design of clinical scenarios, planning clinical technical routes and designing surgical implantation methods.

Scientists develop new ""artificial leaf""
 (Xinhua) 15:42, February 28, 2024
SHENYANG, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists, along with their international counterparts, have developed a brand-new type of ""artificial leaf,"" a liquid metal-embraced photoactive film. It harnesses solar energy to produce hydrogen through direct water splitting, paving the way for scalable production.
The research team led by Prof. Liu Gang from the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, recently published their research in Nature Communications, an international academic journal.
The film, similar to a natural leaf, converts solar energy directly into a chemical fuel, holding great promise in direct solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion. This development is particularly promising under the context of the carbon-neutral initiative, according to the research team.
To fabricate these robust photoactive films, scientists developed a new particle-implanting technique that embeds semiconductor photo-absorbers in the liquid metal. This method draws inspiration from the fact that photosystems II and I, which drive photosynthesis in leaves and are embedded within the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
Under visible light irradiation, its photocatalytic activity for water splitting to produce hydrogen is 2.9 times that of traditional films. Furthermore, it can work continuously for over a hundred hours without attenuation.
""An added benefit of such films is that a wide range of low-melting-point metals and semiconductors can be used, and all materials used can be easily recycled via ultra-sonication in hot water,"" said Liu. ""All in all, this new technique promises a low-cost scalable processing route for solar energy conversion devices and applications.""

China develops robot for cultural relics protection,2024-02-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0228/c90000-20138399.html,"Home>>
		
China develops robot for cultural relics protection
 (Xinhua) 14:41, February 28, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- China's strides in space technology are now enriching the preservation of cultural relics, as spacecraft engineers have repurposed a robot originally designed for orbital missions to protect tomb artifacts.
The China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) recently announced the development of such a robot. Combined with electron beam irradiation technology, it can be used as an intelligent mobile system to eradicate bacteria that thrive on ancient murals in small tombs.
Equipped with a robotic arm mounted on a mobile wheeled chassis, this device can scan scenes of tomb walls and domes.
Similar to the radiation disinfection technology used in medical treatment, the electron beams can eliminate harmful bacteria that cause murals to fade or chip over time.
The project was initiated by the Dunhuang Academy, an institute for the protection and research of the World cultural heritage of Dunhuang Grottoes in China. It has accumulated rich experience in cave painting conservation over the past decades. From 2020 to 2022, the academy has taken the lead in on-site protection of national tomb murals.
""The tomb mural preservation poses a great challenge,"" said Yu Zongren, head of the academy's conservation institute.
Being buried deep underground for extended periods exposes tomb murals to highly humid environments, fostering the proliferation of microorganisms that accelerate their deterioration. Furthermore, given the generally confined space within tombs, any negligence in cleaning and protection work can result in additional damage to these invaluable relics.
The conventional disinfection approach involves the use of chemical agents, which, unfortunately, may pose health risks to the people involved as well as affect the murals.
As immovable cultural relics, murals need on-site protection, so using traditional biocide agents is not a sustainable option, Yu noted.
In response to the demand for on-site protection of tomb murals, researchers from the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences have undertaken the development of an intelligent mobile irradiation sterilization device. They proposed the requirement of ""maintaining a small and precise size while prioritizing safety,"" and collaborated with engineers from the CAST to develop the robot.
Despite rich experience in developing robotic arms for large space capsules, the engineers have never created a robot specifically for tomb artwork clearing before.
""We had dedicated much of our efforts to reducing size and enhancing the flexibility of the robot, making it more suitable for tomb applications,"" said Xu Jianping, head of the engineering team.
Laser sensors, installed on the remotely operated robot, can detect and avoid obstacles, ensuring a safe distance between the robot and the murals.
According to Xu, these technologies had been used on China's spacecraft.
Although most of the engineers had never seen mural artworks before, they take pride in using space technology for the protection of centuries-old cultural relics, Xu noted.
The robot was showcased for the first time at a domestic exhibition on cultural relic protection last September. The research team plans to conduct more experiments before putting it into service.

"Young talents key to science, tech innovation",2024-02-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0228/c90000-20138229.html,"Home>>
		
Young talents key to science, tech innovation
By Lin Rupeng (China Daily) 09:40, February 28, 2024

China has been advocating the need for developing new productive forces in order to promote innovation and high-quality development. Scientific research is an innovative, complex and uncertain activity that requires large amounts of resource input.
To be sure, young science and technology talents are the driving force of research and innovation. And without continuous human, material and financial resources, it is difficult to achieve breakthroughs in the field of science and technology.
Young talents need more support
First, despite the above fact, young science and technology talents are in a disadvantaged position in resource competitions for a lack of sustained support. For example, in recent years, due to the rapid increase in the number of applicants, the average funding rate for the National Natural Science Foundation's Young Scientists Fund has decreased.
The support and coverage of the basic research funds for central universities for young science and technology talents need to be further improved. And while there are few opportunities to take the lead in major, key projects and research platforms, the opportunities for young talents to take on major responsibilities are also few.
Second, there is a need to improve the academic environment for young science and technology talents. Some young talents have to do a large amount of non-research and teaching-related work, which consumes a lot of their time and energy, leaving them with less time to engage in genuine research, making it difficult for them to produce original, high-quality results.
Additionally, the allowance or salary, and resource allocation for young talents who have not obtained certain titles are relatively low. As a result, some young talents end up spending a lot of their precious time and energy in the pursuit of these titles, such as networking with and unnecessarily ""paying respect to their seniors"", making it difficult for them to focus on research.
Third, there is not enough administrative capacity for the development of young talents. To conduct serious and focused research, young talents need to engage in a great amount of preparatory work including applying for funds, procuring equipment and adding to laboratory paraphernalia. Each of these procedures requires support from the employing institutions, which is apparently in severe shortage.
Fourth, a comprehensive evaluation mechanism that encourages young talents to take up challenging research is yet to be established. For example, an increasing number of universities are implementing a pre-employment or tenured employment system for young researchers. If a young talent doesn't have enough published papers or projects, he or she may fail to get promoted as an associate professor and cannot renew contracts.
Finally, most young talents still struggle to make ends meet and thus cannot fully concentrate on research. Although young talents can meet their basic living needs from the salaries they get, only ""high-end talents"" who have obtained certain titles or published papers are paid decent salaries. The rest still face significant livelihood and other pressure â€” for example in buying or renting a house and paying for their children's education.
A problem-solving approach to boost capability of talents
To address these problems, it is necessary to focus on national strategic needs, adopt a problem-solving approach, and build a comprehensive, systematic institutional system to boost the independent capability of young talents.
In the new era, the focus should be on attracting talents from all over the world and systematically mobilizing them to build a strong country and achieve national rejuvenation.
Amid the increasingly fierce global competition in the field of science and technology, the flow of intellectual capital has accelerated. So to win the international talent competition, it is necessary to adopt a more open approach to attracting and using overseas talents, and to set up an overseas talent introduction system to meet the needs of the country.
Besides, the focus should be on building a strategic independent talent training system to boost the independent and controllable innovation capability of talents. In this regard, it is necessary to establish a mechanism for discovering young talents using big data, artificial intelligence and other information technology tools, and prepare a comprehensive list of potential talents based on their education background, work experience, teaching and research achievements, competency, development potential, teamwork and leadership.
The idea is to give young talents the option of choosing their research direction or path, providing them with adequate resource support, and helping them participate in global scientific and technological competitions to test and cultivate their research and innovation capability.
This may require the further deepening of reforms and implementing new concepts, policies and measures for talents, including boosting long-term support for young science and technology talents, granting higher amounts for research projects at all levels, offering sustained support for young talents, implementing a ""lump sum"" funding management model for certain projects, and improving the ""leading by competition"" system for research projects.
It is also necessary to provide one-stop services for young science and technology talents. The document, issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology and other departments in 2022, to reduce the burden on young scientific researchers proposed to solve the prominent problems faced by young researchers by, among other things, increasing the opportunities for emerging talents, widening the channels for growth, conducting fewer and honest evaluations, and easing their administrative burdens. This will stimulate young talents' innovative potential and allow them to focus their attention on research.
As for universities and research institutions, they should loosen the reins on young talents, and provide them with the needed services and support including start-up funding to redress their grievances and meet their genuine needs.
Improving the evaluation and incentive system for young talents is also necessary. The evaluation process for young talents engaged in applied research should focus on their research and development capabilities, and industrial application of their research results. To retain talents, for instance, measures should be taken to provide them with a more relaxed research environment.
In order to ensure young talents realize their full potential, the authorities need to build a mechanism that values innovations and outstanding research work through actions such as promotions and salary increments, so as to allow young talents in the early stages of their careers to not worry about livelihood issues and concentrate on their research, better tap their potential and serve the country.

China to drill into subglacial lake in Antarctica,2024-02-28,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0228/c90000-20138228.html,"Home>>
		
China to drill into subglacial lake in Antarctica
 (Xinhua) 09:40, February 28, 2024
SHANGHAI, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's scientific expedition team plans to drill into a subglacial lake buried over 3,600 meters deep beneath the ice cap in Antarctica, a scientist said Tuesday.
The Qilin Subglacial Lake, which was named by China in 2022, is located in the Princess Elizabeth Land in the East Antarctic inland ice sheet, 120 km from China's Taishan station, according to Jiang Su, a researcher at the Polar Research Institute of China.
China has made some early-stage preparations for the scientific drilling of the subglacial lake. During the country's ongoing 40th Antarctic expedition, its expedition team members entered the lake area for the first time and carried out investigations on the selection of drilling sites.
""The Qilin Subglacial Lake, the second-largest buried lake discovered so far in Antarctica, has a developing history of at least 3 million years of isolation from the outside world, thus making it an ideal place to explore subglacial lakes and subglacial life,"" Jiang said.
The researcher gave no specific timetable for the drilling.
Before launching the drilling, the Polar Research Institute of China will first work with several research institutes in the country to make breakthroughs in key technologies such as clean and retrievable drilling, in-situ probing and clean sampling, on-site processing of microbiological samples in cryogenic environments, and monitoring of microbiological contamination in the drilling process.
Since 2015, China's fixed-wing aircraft for polar flight Snow Eagle 601 has conducted several aerial surveys of the Princess Elizabeth Land area. Based on airborne geophysical data, the subglacial lake is estimated to have a surface area of 370 square kilometers with a water depth of up to 200 meters.
Long covered by the ice sheet, the Antarctic subglacial lakes have unique high-pressure, low-temperature, low-nutrient and dark environmental conditions that provide unique information on biological evolution, climate change as well as the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet.
Scientific drilling is the only means of obtaining physical samples from subglacial lakes. Since 2012, the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia have carried out drilling into and taken samples from three other subglacial lakes in Antarctica.

"U.S. lunar lander to lose control, end mission in advance",2024-02-27,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0227/c90000-20138008.html,"Home>>
		
U.S. lunar lander to lose control, end mission in advance
 (Xinhua) 16:53, February 27, 2024
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. company Intuitive Machines' first lunar lander Odysseus will lose control and end its mission earlier than expected on Tuesday morning, the company said on Monday.
The lander will lose communication with flight controllers in Huston due to its solar panels off work by early morning Tuesday. This will cut the mission short for two to three days from a week expected by NASA and other customers, according to U.S. media reports.
The uncrewed lander landed at the lunar South Pole last Thursday, marking the first American spacecraft to land on the lunar surface in more than 50 years.
Although the Odysseus touched down on the lunar surface, analysis of data by flight engineers showed the six-legged spacecraft tripped over its own feet during its final descent, said Intuitive Machines CEO Stephen Altemus. The spacecraft was believed to have caught one of its landing feet on the uneven lunar surface and came to rest sideways.
""Flight controllers intend to collect data until the lander's solar panels are no longer exposed to light. Based on Earth and Moon positioning, we believe flight controllers will continue to communicate with Odysseus until Tuesday morning,"" said the company.
After understanding the end-to-end communication requirements, Odysseus sent images from the lunar surface of its vertical descent to its Malapert A landing site, representing the furthest south any vehicle has been able to land on the Moon and establish communication with ground controllers, according to the company.
Odysseus carries NASA science and other commercial payloads to the Moon.
The last U.S. moon landing mission was made in December 1972, when Apollo 17 touched down on the lunar surface for the final mission of the Apollo Program.

Beijing has granted permits to several robotaxi operators, including Baidu Inc and Pony.ai, allowing them to offer driverless vehicle services at Beijing Daxing International Airport, a key step indicating that the city has become the world's first capital to run autonomous passenger vehicles between urban areas and the airport.
Industry experts said the move marks a milestone in China's efforts to develop an intelligent transportation system, and will further bolster the commercial application of self-driving technology.
The approval, granted by the head office of Beijing High-Level Automated Driving Demonstration Area, allows these companies to provide self-driving vehicle services on 40-kilometer expressways connecting the international airport with Yizhuang in Beijing's Daxing district, as well as in some designated areas within the airport.
The permits come with the precondition that a safety inspector will sit behind the steering wheel and take manual control in case of an emergency.
The Beijing municipal government has unveiled plans to expand the scope of demonstration zones for high-level autonomous driving this year and promote the orderly launch of self-driving services in key areas such as airports, railway stations and urban roads.
""The approval is of great significance in further accelerating the commercialization of autonomous driving technology across the nation,"" said Zhang Xiang, a researcher at the Jiangxi New Energy Technology Institute, adding that other first-tier cities are likely to follow Beijing and allow the commercial operation of driverless vehicles at their airports in the future.
Zhang also called for more efforts to strengthen the construction of intelligent transportation infrastructure, such as 5G-enabled vehicle-to-everything, or V2X system, which supports communication between a vehicle and any entity that may affect or may be affected by the vehicle, in order to improve traffic efficiency and minimize accident risks.
Chen Zhuo, general manager of Baidu's self-driving business unit, said the company is concentrating on expanding its commercial robotaxi fleet.
Chen said Baidu's fully autonomous vehicles are currently operating in several cities including Beijing, Chongqing, Wuhan in Hubei province and Shenzhen in Guangdong province. The company plans to expand its fleet size and operation area, and build the world's largest fully driverless ride-hailing zone, he added.
Baidu's Apollo Go service has accumulated more than 4.1 million ride orders as of Sept 30. In the third quarter of last year, Apollo Go provided 821,000 rides, up 73 percent year-on-year. It has obtained more than 5,000 autonomous driving patents, with the total testing mileage of its self-driving vehicles exceeding 90 million kilometers.
A report released by global consultancy IHS Markit said the market size of China's self-driving taxi services is expected to surpass 1.3 trillion yuan ($180.6 billion) by 2030, accounting for 60 percent of the ride-hailing market nationwide.
China has introduced a series of policies to promote the development and commercialization of self-driving technology in recent years.
According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the country supports the commercial application of Level 3 and above autonomous driving systems. Level 3, or L3, means conditional automation, which allows a vehicle to drive by itself without human override under certain conditions.
Lyu Jinghong, an analyst of intelligent mobility at research company BloombergNEF, said the permits to operate robotaxi services between Daxing international airport and Yizhuang will further boost the testing and application scenarios of self-driving cars, especially on routes between transportation hubs and urban roads.
According to BloombergNEF's Electric Vehicle Outlook, China will operate the world's largest robotaxi fleet with about 12 million self-driving vehicles by 2040, followed by the United States with around 7 million such vehicles.
