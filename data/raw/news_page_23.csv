CHENGDU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- In a world experiencing rapid warming, effectively cooling our homes during sweltering summer months with reduced energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for meeting carbon reduction targets.
A team of Chinese researchers has crafted an innovative biomass-derived material using DNA, the genetic blueprint of life. This aerogel demonstrates a remarkable ability to reduce ambient temperatures by 16 degrees Celsius on sunny days, even under intense solar radiation.
The researchers combined DNA and gelatin into an ordered layered aerogel structure that converts absorbed ultraviolet light into visible light to surpass 100 percent solar reflectance, yielding exceptional radiative cooling.
The adoption of biopolymer-based radiative cooling material helps mitigate environmental pollution, according to the study published on Friday in the journal Science.
Moreover, these aerogels, efficiently fabricated on a large scale through water welding, demonstrate remarkable reparability, recyclability and biodegradability.
This aerogel material is poised to revolutionize the energy efficiency of urban architecture as an outer protective layer, said the paper's corresponding author Zhao Haibo from Sichuan University.
The simulation outcomes of the study have demonstrated a substantial reduction in annual energy expenditure in cooling for buildings across all modeled cities.
The novel aerogel holds promise for significantly reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption and paves the way for innovative and sustainable radiative cooling materials in the future, Zhao said.
China has committed to the dual carbon goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.

SHANGHAI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- As global scrutiny on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) intensifies, China has emphasized the critical need to develop this transformative technology in a way that is safe, reliable, inherently controllable and equitable.
In a declaration unveiled at the ongoing World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC), China underscored the importance of ethical and responsible AI development while advocating for the use of AI to bolster the capabilities of developing nations.
The development of AI technologies faces a series of new challenges in areas such as law, security, employment and moral ethics, said Chinese Premier Li Qiang while addressing the opening ceremony of the WAIC.
""The risks associated with AI range from data leaks, privacy and copyright infringements to disinformation and ethical issues like bias and discrimination,"" said Zhou Bowen, director of Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, in a keynote speech at the WAIC. ""There is also growing concern about its potential disruption to employment,"" Zhou added.
""While perspectives on AI may vary, one consensus is clear: we must ensure that AI is always subject to human oversight to achieve safe and constructive outcomes, and achieving this goal demands a collaborative approach from nations worldwide,"" said Yin Hejun, Chinese minister of science and technology.
China's proposal for global AI governance has been widely endorsed by WAIC attendees from across the world. They agreed on the pressing need to bolster international collaboration to effectively mitigate the potential risks posed by this groundbreaking technological progress.
The best approach to strike a balance between the pace of AI innovation and the need for responsible development is to ""work together globally,"" ensuring that these remarkable new capabilities are deployed responsibly, noted Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys.
Addressing the main forum on AI governance at the WAIC, Chinese vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu voiced strong opposition to attempts to monopolize AI resources, unilaterally dictate the formulation of rules, or create exclusionary alliances. He also denounced any malicious interference in the initiatives of other countries.
George Chen, an analyst at the Asia Group, a consultancy firm headquartered in Washington D.C., said that it is understandable for Washington to seek a significant advantage in its competitive stance against Beijing.
Chen, however, stressed the critical need for a global consensus to ""prevent AI from being weaponized,"" and cautioned that without such an agreement, ""the consequence can be unthinkable.""
China's advocacy for AI governance has placed a special focus on ensuring that developing nations do not lag behind in the global AI landscape. The effort includes initiatives such as the Global AI Governance Initiative launched by the country, and a resolution unanimously adopted at the 78th UN General Assembly to enhance international cooperation on AI capacity building.
""Every nation, irrespective of its size, power, wealth, or social structure, holds an inherent right to the equitable advancement and application of AI,"" said Ma. ""It is particularly crucial to increase the representation and influence of developing countries.""
""There is a gap between what you see in the Global South and in developed countries,"" said Jose Roberto, deputy consul-general of Brazil in Shanghai.
""After WAIC, we are creating an agenda of visits to AI institutions in Shanghai and in Beijing,"" Roberto added. ""I'm very excited for the collaboration.""

Chinese researchers develop novel method to produce crystals
 (Xinhua) 13:52, July 06, 2024
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have created a novel method to produce crystals to greatly improve the controllability of their structures, according to a research article published in Science on Friday.
Crystals are indispensable key materials in modern computers, communications, aviation and laser technology. The new method of crystal production is expected to enhance the computing power of chips and serve a new generation of electronic integrated circuits and photonic integrated circuits.
The traditional method of producing large-size crystals is usually to layer atoms ""bottom-up"" on the surface of small crystal particles. This method is limited by the necessity for strict screening of the type and arrangement of atoms to successfully accumulate and form crystals.
""When the number of atoms increases, the atomic arrangement gradually becomes uncontrolled, and impurities and defects are gradually accumulated, affecting both purity and quality of the crystal"", said Liu Kaihui, a professor at the School of Physics of Peking University.
They developed a new method to accurately control the atomic arrangement, enabling the crystal growth rate to speed up to 50 layers per minute, with the number of layers reaching up to 15,000.
The atomic arrangement of each layer is completely parallel and precisely controllable, which effectively avoids the accumulation of defects in crystal growth and improves the controllability of the structure.
The researchers have applied this new method to produce seven types of two-dimensional crystals.
""The monolayer thickness of the two-dimensional crystals is only 0.7 nanometers,"" said Liu. ""When they are used in the transistors of integrated circuits, the integration of the chips can be significantly improved.""
""And the density of transistors can be greatly increased on a fingernail-sized chip to provide more computing power,"" said Liu.
Such crystals can also be used for infrared frequency conversion of light, which is expected to promote the application of ultra-thin optical chips.

China will employ a raft of well-focused policy steps to foster a more enabling climate for the development of the digital economy, the State Council, the country's Cabinet, said on Friday.
Topping the agenda are priorities like improving data infrastructure and relevant institutional systems, and promoting market-oriented allocation of data resources.
Given the far-reaching impact of the digital economy, emphasis should be placed on comprehensively integrating these technologies with the real economy, so as to provide a solid underpinning for economic and social development, according to the State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Qiang.
China's total data output reached 32.85 zettabytes in 2023, up more than 22 percent year-on-year, while the added value of core digital economy industries accounted for 10 percent of GDP, according to the National Data Administration.
On Tuesday, during the Global Digital Economy Conference 2024, Liu Liehong, head of the administration, said that China is set to prioritize relevant institutional reforms this year, aiming to unleash the potential of the country's vast data resources and transform them into a new competitive advantage.
The administration plans to roll out eight institutional documents, focusing on data property rights, data circulation, revenue distribution, security governance, public data development and utilization, enterprise data development and utilization, high-quality development of the digital economy, and data infrastructure construction, Liu said.
The rapid development of China's digital industries came on the back of robust digital infrastructure. Recent statistics from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology showed that the country had built 3.837 million 5G base stations by the end of May, accounting for 60 percent of the global total.
Friday's meeting also announced that efforts will be made to enhance the innovation capabilities of platform companies and promote the sustained and healthy development of the platform economy.
The platform economy has emerged as a vital force both in facilitating connectivity between the digital and real economies and in driving the development of the real economy, according to a report by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.
The market value of China's platform economy surged from 4.97 trillion yuan ($683.90 billion) in 2015 to 33.43 trillion yuan in 2022, with a compound annual growth rate of 32.92 percent. Furthermore, by the end of 2022, the number of Chinese platform unicorns — enterprises valued at over $1 billion — reached 254, marking an increase of 190 companies compared to 2015.

Major records of China's space station spacewalks,2024-07-05,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0705/c90000-20190050.html,"Home>>
		
Major records of China's space station spacewalks
 (Xinhua) 13:01, July 05, 2024
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Photos of Shenzhou-18 crew member Li Cong wearing a white spacesuit while performing a spacewalk on Wednesday have attracted wide media coverage. Although extravehicular activities (EVAs) have become routine for Chinese space station taikonauts over the past three years, it is still an exhilarating experience for readers to see the young space flyer against the magnificent backdrop of Earth.
The recent spacewalk is Li's first, and it also marks the 16th at the Chinese space station since the first crew entered the enormous orbiting spacecraft Tiangong in 2021. According to data released by the China Manned Space Agency on Thursday, a total of 17 space station taikonauts have conducted spacewalks so far.
Here's a look at some records about the spacewalks during the seven crew missions in the past three years.
The first space station spacewalk, which lasted about seven hours, was conducted by the Shenzhou-12 taikonauts Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo on July 4, 2021. Before constructing the Tiangong space station, China had conducted only one spacewalk during the three-day Shenzhou-7 spaceflight in 2008.
The Shenzhou-13 crew, like its predecessors, also conducted two spacewalks during its six-month journey in orbit. But it made history by including the first female Chinese spacewalker Wang Yaping. The taikonaut with a ponytail and soft-spoken voice is also known as the ""space teacher"" after giving a live video lecture to students during her first space mission in 2013.
Dubbed ""the busiest space crew"" by Chinese netizens, the Shenzhou-14 completed three spacewalks. Their first one was particularly remarkable as they became the first crew to exit from the Wentian lab module instead of the core module, as previous crews did. Additionally, just 16 days later, they made their second spacewalk, setting a record for the shortest duration between two EVAs.
The Shenzhou-15 crew performed four spacewalks in their six-month mission since the all-men trio was launched into space in November 2022, setting a domestic record for the most spacewalks by a single crew.
Compared to previous crews, the Shenzhou-16 comprised a diverse trio of male taikonauts from different career backgrounds, including an aircraft pilot, a flight engineer and a payload specialist. During its five-month stay in space, the crew only performed one EVA, during which the crew commander, Jing Haipeng, also a four-time space flyer, finally realized his dream of conducting a spacewalk.
The Shenzhou-17 crew conducted two EVAs, with the second marking a milestone as it was the first time Chinese spacewalkers completed maintenance tasks.
The longest spacewalk was conducted by the Shenzhou-18 crew, who was launched to Tiangong in late April. Commander Ye Guangfu and crew member Li Guangsu spent about 8.5 hours working outside the space station on May 28, longer than any previous Chinese spacewalk.
According to the Chinese space agency, the Shenzhou-18 trio has completed one-third of their six-month space journey and is scheduled to carry out a large number of in-orbit scientific experiments and technological tests.
The youngest-ever crew for the orbiting Chinese space station may have the opportunity to conduct additional spacewalks, achieving even more remarkable milestones in history.

China sets exemplary model for world in high-speed rail technologies,2024-07-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0704/c90000-20189627.html,"Home>>
		
China sets exemplary model for world in high-speed rail technologies
By Li Xinping (People's Daily) 16:33, July 04, 2024
Today, China's Fuxing bullet train has become the world's fastest commercially operated train with the most diverse operating scenarios. By the end of 2023, Fuxing bullet trains had operated 2.34 billion kilometers safely and transported a total of 2.2 billion passenger trips.
From the initiation of the train's development in 2013 to its impressive debut in 2017, the Fuxing bullet train epitomizes China's innovative prowess.
In 2004, faced with the country's surging demand for a railway speed-up, China began to track high-speed rail technologies from around the world and successively introduced technologies from Japan, France, Canada, and Germany.

Three years later, the Hexie high-speed train officially went into service, and subsequently, a series of products were developed and put into mass production.
With the remarkable performance of the Hexie series, why was there a need to develop the Fuxing bullet trains?
The total mileage of high-speed railways in China is unparalleled in the world, and no county has such a complex operating environment.
""Some imported train models inevitably face challenges in adapting to the local conditions and require further innovation,"" said Ye Yangsheng, chief engineer of China Railway.
Every upgrade or modification on foreign technology platforms inevitably involves software updates, and sometimes even requires the assistance of foreign experts, Ye explained.
Although China mastered the technologies of the Hexie series, and many of the technologies were developed and improved through independent innovation, due to the use of foreign technology platforms and adoption of foreign standards, further development was constrained, said former chief engineer of China Railway Corporation He Huawu. Therefore, it was imperative to develop high-speed trains with Chinese standards.
""A high-speed train traveling at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour includes over 40,000 parts, covering various technical fields such as mechanics, metallurgy, materials, power electronics, chemical engineering, and information control,"" said Wang Jun, chief scientist of China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC).
Besides, with China's super large railway network, complex geographical and climatic conditions, and long-distance and continuous high-speed operation, the independent development of high-speed trains faced unprecedented challenges, Wang added.
To reduce noise, more than 3,000 tests were conducted on different materials and structures for sound insulation. As a result, the Fuxing bullet train is able to run at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour with a minimum noise level of 65 decibels in the train compartments.
To reduce vehicle resistance and energy consumption, over 40 different solutions were analyzed through simulation and wind tunnel tests. As a result, aerodynamic resistance was reduced by 14 percent, and energy consumption per passenger per 100 kilometers was cut by 20 percent.
To achieve optimal harmonic control for the entire vehicle, the research and development team went through numerous cycles of design, analysis, testing, and optimization. This process ultimately led to the development of an innovative control module that has reached world-class standards.

During the independent innovation of the Fuxing high-speed train, the research and development team has made breakthroughs in core control technologies such as traction, braking, and networking, as well as key technologies in wheel, axle, and gearbox design and manufacturing.
Among the 254 important standards adopted by the train, 84 percent are Chinese. The overall design of the train, as well as key technologies such as the train body and bogie, were independently developed, and the software was entirely self-developed, possessing complete independent intellectual property rights.
After undergoing over 10,000 simulations, ground tests, and line trials, the Chinese-standard high-speed train Fuxing obtained its model certificate and manufacturing license in 2017. In June of that year, the Fuxing bullet train made its debut.
Three months later, the train started commercial operation with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, and in December 2019, it also achieved a speed of 350 kilometers per hour on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway, operating in autonomous driving mode.
In June 2021, the Fuxing train, powered by internal combustion and electric power, extended its services to Lhasa, Xizang autonomous region, marking that the train has reached 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China.
From research and development, manufacturing to operational services, more than 100 core enterprises and over 2,100 associated enterprises are involved in designing and producing components for the high-speed trains.
The Fuxing bullet train has stimulated the growth of the entire rail transportation industry. Statistics show that the scale of China's rail transportation equipment industry reached approximately 480 billion yuan ($66.05 billion) in 2022, and is expected to hit 600 billion yuan by 2025.
The Fuxing high-speed train has also ventured beyond the borders, becoming a golden signboard of China internationally.
In December 2021, the China-Laos Railway commenced operations, marking the first time for the Fuxing bullet train to go outside of China. In October 2023, a high-speed train with a maximum speed of 350 kilometers per hour, developed based on the Fuxing platform, was put into service on Indonesia's Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway. It was the first time for an overseas project to fully use Chinese railway systems, technology and industrial components.
By the end of 2023, China had led the development and revision of 65 international standards under the International Organization for Standardization, International Electrotechnical Commission, and International Union of Railways (UIC).
Additionally, it had participated in 249 international standard development and revision projects. The formulation of all 11 system-level UIC international standards in the field of high-speed rail was led by China.

CRRC releases world's first report on carbon footprint of pure electric locomotives,2024-07-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0704/c90000-20189610.html,"Home>>
		
CRRC releases world's first report on carbon footprint of pure electric locomotives
By Li Xinping (People's Daily) 16:07, July 04, 2024
Chinese state-owned and publicly traded rolling stock manufacturer China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) on June 28 launched seven new energy locomotives, which come in three power configurations - hybrid powered by both diesel and electricity, power battery only and hydrogen fuel cell.
The series of locomotives feature low emission, low noise and high efficiency. They offer an effective solution to the high fuel consumption, high emission and high noise issues faced by old-fashioned diesel-powered locomotives.

Besides, CRRC released the world's first report on the carbon footprint of pure electric locomotives, which was reviewed by authoritative international organizations and awarded the ISO 14067 carbon footprint verification.
The report accurately calculates the trajectories of carbon dioxide emissions of new energy locomotives throughout their entire lifecycle - from raw iron ore to being recycled after 30 years of service, using a combination of real-world scenarios and modeling techniques, said Wang Feifei, deputy head of the green and low-carbon development group of the CRRC development transformation office.
The report measures carbon emissions in the manufacturing of every screw, nut, as well as major components such as the bodies, wheelsets, and bogies, the acquisition of raw materials, and general assembly.
According to the information obtained, the calculation involved over 97,000 data points, all derived from real-world scenarios, providing an accurate reflection of the products' manufacturing process. For emission factors that were difficult to directly obtain, background data from internationally authoritative databases were used.
The final verification showed that the carbon footprint of a 1,000 kW hybrid locomotive powered by both diesel and electricity is 7.4 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilometer, and that of a 1,000 kW pure electric locomotive is 7.92 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilometer.
An analysis of carbon emissions at various stages of locomotive production reveals that the operational phase has the most significant impact on a product's carbon footprint during the entire lifecycle.
Over a 30-year operational period, a pure electric locomotive with a 1,000-ton capacity, running on green electricity at 40 percent of standard operational speed, can reduce its carbon footprint by 94.2 percent compared to traditional locomotives, cutting carbon emissions by 4,076 tons. For a hybrid locomotive using both diesel and electricity under the same conditions, the reductions would be 61.7 percent and 2,735 tons, respectively.
It is learned that key components of the new energy locomotive series adopt lightweight designs. The traction motor's weight has been reduced by 22.5 percent, and that of the bogie by 6.7 percent. Steel structures in the driver's cab have been reduced by 40 percent, and those of the underframe by 70 percent. This has effectively lowered carbon emissions in raw material acquisition, as well as component production and transportation.

A 1,000 kW new energy locomotive is assembled in a workshop of CRRC Ziyang Co., Ltd. in southwest China's Sichuan province. (Photo from the public account of CRRC on WeChat)
""Moreover, we maximized the use of green electricity in the manufacturing process, with green power accounting for over 20 percent of our electricity consumption. This enabled us to achieve about a 52 percent reduction in carbon footprint during manufacturing and maintenance phases compared to the models being replaced,"" Wang said.
""In the future, as manufacturing companies further expand their photovoltaic power generation, this percentage will continue to increase,"" Wang added.
In addition to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the new energy locomotive series also excel in reducing pollutant emissions.
According to statistics, the diesel-power battery hybrid locomotive can achieve a 45 percent reduction in nitrogen oxides, a 73 percent reduction in hydrocarbons, and an 83 percent reduction in carbon monoxide emissions.
With a 45 percent reduction in pollutants, each locomotive can reduce harmful substance emissions by 4 tons and carbon emissions by 374 tons annually.
Adopting an optimal hybrid power control technology, the hybrid locomotive can ensure that the diesel engine always operates at its most economical speed. When pulling a 3,000-ton load on a straight track with a full tank of fuel, this locomotive can travel over 1,100 kilometers - 1.7 times the range of traditional diesel-powered locomotives - with a fuel efficiency improvement of over 45 percent.
The pure electric locomotive launched this time is compatible with various types of charging piles, with charging power exceeding 870 kW. The shortest charging time is less than 40 minutes, and the locomotive can operate in a wide temperature range from minus 40 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius.
For the hydrogen fuel cell locomotive, refueling takes only 10 to 15 minutes, which effectively ensures operational capability and range. Its energy utilization efficiency is over 80 percent higher compared to traditional diesel-powered locomotives.
""This series of new energy locomotives will generate huge and diverse demands for new energy products, and drive the development of upstream industries such as basic materials and key components,"" said Tian Jun, chief engineer of the National Railway Administration and director of the administration's equipment supervision and management department.
