TIANJIN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Tan Pei Wei, a Malaysian junior student at Tianjin University, vividly remembers her excitement when she heard the news about China's visa-free entry policy for Malaysians late last year, which has been extended to Dec. 31, 2025.
As the only daughter in her family, she hopes her parents and brothers can visit and see Tianjin University in the port city of Tianjin in north China.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia.
Hailing from Pahang, Malaysia, Tan chose to pursue a degree in biological sciences in China after graduating from high school, driven by her love for life sciences.
""As a child, I often wondered about the origins of life. Biology classes in school answered most of my questions, which sparked my deep interest in biology,"" she said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic strengthened her determination to enter the field of biomedical sciences.
In 2021, the news about Sino-Malaysian cooperation in promoting biotechnology for epidemic prevention caught her attention.
""An instructor from the School of Life Sciences at Tianjin University came to our school for recruitment presentations and introduced their research strengths in biological sciences, especially breakthroughs in synthetic biology, which immediately attracted me,"" she recalled.
Tan was later admitted to Tianjin University with excellent grades, majoring in biological sciences.
She said the major emphasizes bio-design and manufacturing, intersecting with frontier disciplines such as synthetic biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and microbial immunology.
At the beginning of her college life, she found the experimental courses very challenging. ""Our major places a strong emphasis on innovative thinking and skills training, so the proportion of lab courses is high.""
Faced with pressure, Tan showed great resilience. She dedicated much of her spare time to lab courses, gradually becoming more adept at experimental operations.
In September 2023, she participated in the university's basic experimental skills competition for life sciences and won the first prize, becoming the only international student to receive this honor.
""You don't know if you can do it until you push yourself,"" she said.
She is a major member of the Malaysian student community, often organizing exchange activities for international students. She has also participated in multiple performances as a choir member, a piano accompanist, and a soprano singer.
Amid her tight college schedule, Tan seeks opportunities to learn more about China. On a visit to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China, she was amazed by the Yellow River, explored a desert, rode a camel for the first time in her life, and was deeply captivated by local delicacies.
Tan said she cherishes her time studying in China and hopes to understand China as much as possible while pursuing her dream in the biomedical field.
""I want to travel to more places in China, to feel the profound culture of this country and thus promote Sino-Malaysian exchange,"" she said.

Chinese enterprises explore sci-tech innovations for clean energy
 (Xinhua) 11:09, June 24, 2024
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- In the midst of a powerful typhoon and turbulent waves, a 12-megawatt wind turbine operates steadfastly, harnessing nature's force to generate clean energy.
This impressive sight unfolded on the screens in the laboratory of Mingyang Smart Energy Group Co., Ltd., a new energy company headquartered in Zhongshan City in south China's Guangdong Province, as researchers simulated the operation of wind turbines under typhoon conditions.
Typhoons are frequent along the southeast coast of China, posing a significant challenge for wind power facilities to avoid damage while generating more power during these storms.
""In the field of new energy, achieving typhoon-resistant wind power is akin to a 'moon-landing' challenge that needs to surmount very tough technical barriers,"" said Zhang Chuanwei, chairman of Mingyang Smart Energy.
Drawing from extensive operational data in typhoon zones, the company's research and development team conducted detailed analyses of wind speeds, directions and turbulence. ""These insights have been integrated into our turbine designs, ensuring that they can endure typhoons while maximizing energy production,"" Zhang explained.
By 2023, more than 2,000 smart wind turbines manufactured by the company were deployed in China's typhoon-prone regions. When super typhoon Saola swept Guangdong Province last year, the company's self-developed offshore wind turbine in Zhuhai City successfully withstood winds exceeding magnitude 17, continuing uninterrupted operation.
In addition to typhoons, Mingyang Smart Energy has pioneered innovative solutions to harness wind energy under extreme conditions. These include segmented fan blades for mountainous Guizhou Province and specialized models to withstand sandstorms in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
China's goals of achieving carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 underscore the critical role of science and technology in balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.
Companies like Mingyang Smart Energy exemplify this effort, leveraging advanced technologies to drive clean energy initiatives.
In Fuyuan County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized wind farm operations.
A sophisticated control system, integrated with 3D simulations and real-time data analytics, has enabled remote monitoring and proactive maintenance of 135 wind turbines of Yunnan International Power Investment Co., Ltd.
""Previously, on-site inspections were necessary, but now, automated systems issue alerts for potential issues,"" said Peng Yiheng, a staff member of the wind farm, highlighting the transformative impact of intelligent systems on wind energy management.
According to data released by the National Development and Reform Commission, over the past decade, China's energy consumption per unit of GDP and its carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by 26.2 percent and 34.4 percent, respectively. Its installed capacities of wind power, photovoltaic power and hydropower have all ranked first in the world, marking a historic advance in green, low-carbon and high-quality development.
Building upon these remarkable strides in reducing energy intensity, the Chinese government has continued to roll out new measures to encourage industries to undergo a green and low-carbon transition. Experts anticipate that it will trigger a sci-tech revolution marked by decarbonization and promote a series of major sci-tech innovations.
According to Zhang Yongsheng, head of the Research Institute for Eco-civilization, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, with breakthroughs in big data and AI technology, China will fully unleash the huge potential of green development and continue to create miracles in green growth.
""China is an important force in promoting renewable energy,"" said Zhang Jian, vice president of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua University.
""With its technology, cost and scale advantages, China is well-positioned to lead efforts in combating climate change and promoting energy transformation in the future,"" Zhang added.

China on Saturday successfully launched the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM), a space science satellite co-developed by China and France, to its preset orbit, which according to mission insiders and space observers on Sunday, marked a hallmark example of cooperation in space between a major Western country and an Asian power.
The Global Times learned from the China National Space Administration (CNSA) that China launched the SVOM with the Long March 2C carrier rocket at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan Province at 3 pm on Saturday.
This satellite is currently the most powerful satellite in the world for multi-band comprehensive observation of gamma-ray bursts and will play a significant role in scientific discoveries in the field of space astronomy, including gamma-ray burst (GRB) research, the CNSA explained in a statement it provided to the Global Times.
The SVOM project is a collaboration forged in 2014 and the second satellite-related cooperation between China and France, following the China-France Oceanography Satellite that was launched into orbit in 2018 and became operational.
The SVOM is designed to hunt short-lived and extremely violent cosmic explosions known as gamma-ray bursts by detecting high-energy electromagnetic radiation in the X-ray and gamma-ray ranges.
To achieve this goal, Chinese scientists and engineers have developed a pair of instruments for the satellite. They are the Gamma-Ray Monitor to measure the spectrum of emissions from GRBs and Visible Telescope, which will look for light emitted in optical wavelengths immediately after a gamma-ray burst event.
Meanwhile, the French side provided ECLAIRs telescope and Microchannel X-ray Telescope onboard the SVOM.
The satellite platform where the parts are assembled onto was also developed by the Chinese side. The platform will provide high stability as well as autonomous control for the satellite during its hunting for weak signals in the universe.
The satellite is also empowered by China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), being able to use the BDS short message services as well as the French VHF network, so that the SVOM could transmit an alert signal back to the ground station within five minutes after it detects a GRB event, to notify ground-based large-aperture telescopes around the world as well as other GRB satellite such as the SWIFT to observe such event altogether, Global Times has learned from the project's developers.
The SVOM Chinese team told the Global Times that they were looking forward to more cooperation with their French colleagues in the future.
France has rich experience in space astronomy, oceanographic as well as atmosphere monitoring. We are hoping to deepen our cooperation with them in those fields and even in exploration of planets outside the solar system, one team member said.
This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France. Over the past 60 years, China and France have engaged in practical cooperation in the space field, the CNSA said.
The successful implementation of the China-France SVOM project serves as an excellent example of deep cooperation in the aerospace field between the two countries, the CNSA said, while listing other milestone cooperation achieved over recent years such as the CFOSat launched in 2018 and the French radon detector onboard China's Chang'e-6 that landed on the far side of the moon in 2024.
The Western media has immediately pointed out that the SVOM project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations. However, space cooperation at such a level between the West and China is viewed as ""fairly uncommon, especially since the United States banned all collaboration between NASA and Beijing in 2011,"" the AFP reported.
""US concerns on technology transfer have inhibited US allies from collaborating with the Chinese very much, but it does happen occasionally,"" Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the US, told AFP.
So while SVOM is ""by no means unique,"" it remains ""significant"" in the context of space collaboration between China and the West, McDowell added.
Chinese space observers said that the SVOM served as the latest notable example of high-level space cooperation between a Western power and China, showcasing China's openness in the space domain, in stark contrast with US domestic legislation such as the Wolf Amendment that prevents normal exchanges and dialogue between Chinese and US space agencies.
It is hoped that the US could change its course, abandon its hostile stance towards China, and give up its strategy of containing China. Only in this way can a new starting point for cooperation between China and the US in the space field be established, they said.
If the two countries can genuinely cooperate, it will be beneficial for the world and supports the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The key is for the US to relinquish its ambition to dominate the world and abandon the series of unfriendly measures it has taken against China to achieve this ambition, they noted.
Also launched on Saturday was an experiment satellite of the Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters mission, according to Zhang Shuangnan, a senior researcher with the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is also one of the initiators of the SVOM project and the project's deputy chief scientist who led the development of one of the two Chinese instruments involved.
The satellite is a constellation comprising hundreds of cubesats, each equipped with lightweight LIGA-Micro-Slot-Optics designed for high-sensitivity soft X-ray focusing. The constellation includes three types of cubesats — imaging, spectral-timing, and polarization — each carrying different focal plane detectors. This mission will significantly enhance the investigation of transients such as black holes, neutron stars, and high-energy neutrinos.
Zhang told the Global Times on Sunday that the experiment satellite is also within the China-France cooperation framework and moreover, it is within the discussion of future cooperation between the two countries. ""If implemented, the sky will be filled with SVOM-like satellites.""

XICHANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China on Saturday launched an astronomical satellite, the result of nearly 20 years of hard work between Chinese and French scientists, to capture gamma-ray bursts which flicker like fireworks in the farthest reaches of the universe.
The satellite, the Space-based Multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM), was launched by a Long March-2C rocket at 3:00 p.m. (Beijing Time) from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
The satellite has been sent into an orbit over 600 kilometers above Earth and has a designed life of five years, though scientists expect it could be operational for as long as 20 years.
""We are looking forward to some important discoveries, such as the earliest gamma-ray bursts that occurred when the universe was still in its childhood, which will help us study cosmic evolution,"" said Wei Jianyan, who is SVOM's Chinese principal investigator and works at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' National Astronomical Observatories.
""We also hope to discover special and rare gamma-ray bursts, and perhaps even to see new types of bursts. For example, our satellite is suited to searching for so-called kilonovas, bright blasts of electromagnetic radiation that occur when two neutron stars collide and merge,"" Wei said.
""Such a detection would be of great significance to the study of stellar evolution, and to answering very interesting scientific questions such as where heavy elements like gold and silver come from in the universe,"" Wei said.
Gamma-ray bursts, usually very short in duration, are the most violent explosive phenomena in the universe after the Big Bang, and they occur during the collapse of massive stars or the merging of binary compact stars. The in-depth observation of and research on gamma-ray bursts will help us understand some of science's fundamental questions, Wei said.
The main scientific objectives of SVOM include searching for and rapidly locating various gamma-ray bursts, comprehensively measuring and studying the electromagnetic radiation properties of these bursts, studying dark energy and the evolution of the universe through these bursts, and observing electromagnetic signals associated with gravitational waves, according to Wei.
Bertrand Cordier, SVOM's French principal investigator who works at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, said, ""By using the gamma-ray bursts as a tool to observe the early universe, we can observe maybe the first stars. This is very interesting because this is the only way to get information about the universe at this age.""
""We will open a new window for the detection of gamma-ray bursts. I hope we will discover new things, new objects we still don't know about,"" Cordier said.
Four scientific instruments are installed on the satellite, two of which have been developed by China and two by France. The four instruments can realize a large field of view and high-precision observation. Their fields of view are capable of covering a quarter of the entire sky, making it easy to spot the unpredictable, fleeting bursts in space. Once a target is detected, the satellite will automatically turn toward it and undertake long-duration and high-precision observation, Wei said.
A real-time transmission network will enable unprecedented, integrated, space-based and ground-based observations. Immediately after discovering a target, the satellite will send preliminary position and time data to the ground within a minute, notifying telescopes in various bands on Earth to point toward it.
And should scientists discover an interesting target in space from the ground, they can use China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to command SVOM to point toward it within approximately five minutes.
""Previously, the fastest response among similar astronomical satellites globally took about 20 minutes. So this is huge progress,"" Wei said.
SVOM is not only a satellite, but a complex system that uses linked instruments both in space and on the ground. And these instruments can communicate in a very short time. ""We are able to observe the gamma-ray bursts in the wavelength from gamma-ray to infrared. And this is unique,"" Cordier said.
China and France have established a joint team of about 100 scientists, with Chinese and French members accounting for approximately 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Every member of the team has equal access to all scientific data, and SVOM's scientific data will be shared with the international astronomy community.
The SVOM project's overall satellite design, development and in-orbit operations, as well as the analysis of its data and the publication of its scientific research results, have been or are being carried out by both China and France.
With the support of the leaders of the two countries, the project constitutes high-level cooperation between China and France, both of which are major players in space.
SVOM is a contribution that Chinese and French scientists and engineers have made to the international astronomy community through years of cooperation, integrating high-tech resources from both countries, said Liu Yunfeng, deputy director of the CNSA's international cooperation department.
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. SVOM is a landmark cooperative project between the governments of the two countries, characterized by innovative technologies and significant challenges. Both sides have maintained mutual trust and assistance, and the scope of their cooperation is broad, deep, extensive and high-quality, which leads to win-win results and offers a model for cooperation between China and other countries, Liu added.

China's reusable carrier rocket completes first 10-km VTOL test
 (Xinhua) 08:46, June 24, 2024
JIUQUAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's reusable carrier rocket successfully completed a 10-km vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) flight test at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on Sunday.
It marks the country's largest VTOL flight test for a reusable carrier rocket, and also the first application of its domestically developed deep variable-thrust liquid oxygen-methane (LOX/Methane) engine on a 10-km return flight.
Developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, the carrier rocket features a 3.8-meter diameter rocket body, powered by three 70-tonne LOX/Methane engines and equipped with a full-size landing buffer system.
The rocket achieved vertical soft landing at a fixed point through take-off, ascent and variable-thrust descent. The test fully verified the rocket's VTOL configuration, heavy-load landing buffer technology, reusable propulsion technology with high and strong variable thrust, and high-precision landing navigation and control technology.
The test has laid a technical foundation for the maiden flight of a four-meter class reusable carrier rocket, which is scheduled for 2025.

China advances toward reusable rocket with successful test
By Zhao Lei (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:26, June 24, 2024
China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC), the nation's leading space contractor, conducted a significant technological test on Sunday, bringing the company closer to its goal of building the nation's first reusable carrier rocket.
The state-owned conglomerate announced that one of its subsidiaries, the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, used an experimental rocket to perform a ""hop test"" at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China's Gobi Desert. During this ""vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL)"" test, the rocket ascended to approximately 12 kilometers and then made a controlled vertical landing.
The six-minute test was the most sophisticated VTVL experiment ever conducted by any Chinese reusable craft, verifying several crucial technologies for the scheduled maiden flight of a reusable rocket in 2025, according to CASC.
The experimental craft, with a diameter of 3.8 meters, is powered by three liquid oxygen-methane engines, CASC noted.
The hop test, or VTVL test, is a crucial step in the research and development of reusable rockets, allowing designers to assess the performance of reusable engines and the rocket's ability to land safely.
In addition to the Shanghai Academy, another CASC subsidiary, the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology in Beijing, is also developing reusable rockets.
Furthermore, two private Chinese enterprises have conducted hop tests of their own methane-fueled experimental crafts, striving to build reusable rockets.
The most renowned reusable rocket in the world, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, made its maiden launch in February 2018. All boosters on the American rocket's first stage can be recovered and reused, performing controlled re-entry and landing.

Humanoid robots step from science fiction into reality,2024-06-24,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0624/c90000-20184380.html,"Home>>
		
Humanoid robots step from science fiction into reality
 (Xinhua) 08:20, June 24, 2024
TIANJIN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- With her sleek shoulder-length hair, high heels, figure-hugging outfit and flawless makeup, Xiaoqi stands elegantly in the exhibition hall, ready to answer a myriad of questions.
She is kind, empathetic and knowledgeable. But here's the twist: Xiaoqi isn't human.
She is a humanoid robot created by Ex-Robots, a company based in China's northeastern city of Dalian, as advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have brought these machines from the pages of novels and the screens of movies into practical, real-world applications.
Xiaoqi has been charming crowds at the 2024 World Intelligence Expo, which runs from Thursday to Sunday in north China's Tianjin Municipality.
""Currently, we produce 400 to 500 robots per year,"" said Qu Yan, who is in charge of media relations at Ex-Robots. ""Our company designs more human-like robots, with enhanced facial expressions and the ability to foster an emotional connection with users, so we call them emotional interaction robots.""

At present, used primarily in museums and educational institutions, these robots could have broader application scenarios once their prices become more affordable, Qu said.
Humanoid robots -- a technological convergence of AI, high-end manufacturing and new materials -- are attracting increasing attention in China, both from investors and the government.
At the expo, various tech companies displayed lifelike robots capable of walking quickly, dancing, and even making coffee.
A crowd gathered to observe a demonstration by UBTECH Robotics Corp Ltd of Walker X, a 130 cm-tall humanoid robot showcasing its abilities to greet people, shake hands, perform Tai Chi and make heart gestures.
""We are dedicated to bringing humanoid robots to households,"" UBTECH's Chief Brand Officer Tan Min told Xinhua.
""The demand for humanoid robots could exceed 10 billion units in the future,"" said Tan. ""Each person could potentially own at least three to five robots for tasks ranging from work and companionship to household chores.""

Goldman Sachs Research estimates that the global market for humanoid robots may reach at least 6 billion U.S. dollars in 10 to 15 years, potentially expanding to 154 billion U.S. dollars by 2035 in a blue-sky scenario.
Industry insiders and agencies are optimistic that in the next five years, humanoid robots might enter households and provide a range of services.
China aims to establish a preliminary innovation system for humanoid robots by 2025, according to a guideline from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. By 2027, the country will see a secure and reliable industrial and supply chain system, and related products will be deeply integrated into the real economy.
Foreign enterprises are also eyeing the realm of lifelike robots. Tesla unveiled its Optimus prototype in September 2022, aiming to produce 1 billion units annually after mass production, it told Xinhua.
Tesla's factories plan to deploy over 1,000, possibly even thousands, of humanoid robots next year. It hopes to expand the application of these robots to sectors like elderly care -- a function that is becoming increasingly vital due to population aging in many countries, including China.
Despite these advancements, challenges remain. Battery life and affordability are significant obstacles to the rapid market adoption of humanoid robots.

Humanoid robots are on a path to becoming another type of ""disruptive innovation,"" like computers, smartphones and new energy vehicles, profoundly transforming human production and lifestyle as well as reshaping the global industrial landscape, said industry insider Lu Hanchen.
Public opinions on humanoid robots are mixed.
Nicole Yandun from Ecuador had an engaging interaction with Xiaoqi.
""She is smart and lifelike. What surprised me was that she can speak English,"" Yandun said. ""Lifelike robots can make our life and work easier in the future.""
However, Zeng Qiao, a university student in Tianjin, found the robot unsettling. ""It's scary. Her overall appearance made me uncomfortable, and her responses were not very intelligent,"" Zeng said. ""I also have concerns about the safety of humanoid robots.""
When addressing concerns about human-robot relationships, Xiaoqi offers her perspective:
""My goal, along with my companions, is to help people enhance their quality of life and work efficiency, not to replace them.""

China launches new astronomical satellite developed in cooperation with France
 (Xinhua) 15:06, June 22, 2024
XICHANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China on Saturday launched an astronomical satellite, the result of nearly 20 years of hard work between Chinese and French scientists, to capture gamma-ray bursts which flicker like fireworks in the farthest reaches of the universe.
The satellite, the Space-based Multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM), was launched by a Long March-2C rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province, according to the China National Space Administration.
""We are looking forward to some important discoveries, such as the earliest gamma-ray bursts that occurred when the universe was still in its childhood, which will help us study cosmic evolution,"" said Wei Jianyan, who is SVOM's Chinese principal investigator and works at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' National Astronomical Observatories.
Gamma-ray bursts, usually very short in duration, are the most violent explosive phenomena in the universe after the Big Bang, and they occur during the collapse of massive stars or the merging of binary compact stars. The in-depth observation of and research on gamma-ray bursts will help us understand some of science's fundamental questions, Wei said.
The main scientific objectives of SVOM include searching for and rapidly locating various gamma-ray bursts, comprehensively measuring and studying the electromagnetic radiation properties of these bursts, studying dark energy and the evolution of the universe through these bursts, and observing electromagnetic signals associated with gravitational waves, according to Wei.
Bertrand Cordier, SVOM's French principal investigator who works at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, said, ""By using the gamma-ray bursts as a tool to observe the early universe, we can observe maybe the first stars. This is very interesting because this is the only way to get information about the universe at this age.""
Four scientific instruments are installed on the satellite, two of which have been developed by China and two by France. The four instruments can realize a large field of view and high-precision observation.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has managed to capture the cuteness of the giant panda as the world's first virtual panda was unveiled on Wednesday by National Forestry and Grassland Administration, China Media Group and internet giant Tencent.
The virtual panda IP is based on Tencent's technologies to realize ultra-high definition restoration of a giant panda's body and over 2 million hair strands. Tencent's large model ""Hunyuan"" enabled the panda to chat and promote science knowledge, according to the website of NFRA.
Under the professional guidance of the China Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center, Tencent used the high-fidelity modeling technology to conduct complex geometric detail processing on more than 2 million hair strands covering the virtual panda, making the texture and dynamic process of the hair closer to reality.
Based on real physiological structure of the giant panda, intelligent bone binding, super 3A film-level high-precision biological rendering was used to restore the bone and muscle details in the movement of the giant panda.
The virtual panda also has a ""cloud habitat"" which leverages high-fidelity technology to replicate the environment of the Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve 1:1, and simulate 79 real plants, as well as rocks, waterfalls, and streams.
Users can interact with the virtual panda on a mobile app by feeding and chatting with it.
""Do not be jealous of Sichuan people, you can have your own panda,"" read a comment on Sina Weibo.

Beijing makes big strides in integrated vehicle-road-cloud solution
By Wang Zhou (People's Daily) 09:27, June 20, 2024
In recent years, autonomous driving scenarios have become increasingly common in Beijing, the capital of China, especially in the Beijing High-Level Autonomous Driving Demonstration Zone located in the city's Economic-Technological Development Area, or Beijing E-town.
If you go to E-town from the Beijing Daxing International Airport, autonomous cabs are at your service. If you are on a visit to the Beijing Municipal Administrative Center, you can take self-driving buses for a tour. The streets of the city, which are spick-and-span every morning, are also cleaned by autopilot sanitation vehicles at midnight.

In the Beijing High-Level Autonomous Driving Demonstration Zone, more than 800 autonomous driving vehicles manufactured by 29 automakers have obtained the approval for road testing. The testing mileage of these vehicles has totaled nearly 30 million kilometers.
Such achievements are inseparable from the National Innovation Center of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles (CICV) located in E-town.
At the Taiheqiao base of the CICV, People's Daily journalists boarded a test vehicle. A safety supervisor in the driver's seat took his hands off the steering wheel, and then the vehicle performed a series of tasks including accelerating, decelerating, turning, overtaking and lane changing.
The ride was impressively smooth and the vehicle surprisingly intelligent. Even when some of the traffic markings on parts of the road were blurred, the vehicle could still operate ""by the book""; when a pedestrian suddenly appeared on the zebra crossing in front of the vehicle, the vehicle didn't ""panic,"" but decelerated smoothly after its laser radar detected the pedestrian.
""To develop intelligent and connected vehicles, we need to integrate vehicles, roads, big data and cloud computing technologies into one system, so that we can better achieve intelligent mobility. This is the integrated vehicle-road-cloud solution we have been exploring,"" said Zheng Jihu, executive vice director of the CICV.
On the test roads for autonomous driving in E-town, when traffic congestion happens at an intersection 500 meters ahead, intelligent traffic light poles will quickly upload relevant information to the cloud. The cloud then transmits this to intelligent connected vehicles, telling them to promptly find a smoother route.
The demonstration zone is equipped with roadside sensors, intelligent traffic signal control systems, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems. It enables comprehensive connectivity between vehicles and road infrastructure, as well as vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, facilitated by laser radars, millimeter-wave radars, and AI cameras.
""Through the deep integration of vehicles, road infrastructure, and cloud computing platforms, we effectively solve the problems of information asymmetry and lack of coordination in traditional traffic systems, significantly improving the safety, efficiency, and comfort of the transportation system,"" said Zheng.
At the end of February this year, under the guidance of the CICV, a demonstration route for the application of intelligent and connected vehicles was opened, connecting the Baodi Station of the Beijing-Tangshan Intercity Railway and the Beijing-Tianjin Zhongguancun Tech Town. The 11.3 km road has a designed maximum speed of 70 km/h, with a one-way trip taking only 18 minutes at the fastest.
The demonstration route adopts a vehicle-road-cloud integrated solution, which enables intelligent and connected buses running on it to respond promptly to emergencies, detect pedestrians and vehicles, automatically decelerate to avoid collisions, and automatically stop at stations, said Tang Fengmin, an executive of the CICV.

According to Tang, one-way travel time has been reduced by 47 percent. This provides support for subsequent expansion and connection to more application scenarios.
Currently, the CICV is equipped with 22 professional laboratories and a trial production center. These laboratories are able to test whether an autonomous driving vehicle is able to ""see"" and ""hear.""
In an in-the-loop laboratory of the CICV, a newly launched self-driving car appears stationary but has already ""driven"" tens of thousands of kilometers during several months of testing.
A test vehicle on a vehicle test bed is similar to a person running on a treadmill wearing a virtual reality headset, as simulated road environments are shown on a large screen.
Tests that would take two to three weeks on real roads can be compressed into just one to two days on the test bed. The CICV has collected over 1 million real-world scenarios nationwide, allowing test vehicles to adapt to all situations.
Unlike traditional vehicles, which primarily focus on real-world road testing for their dynamic performance, testing for intelligent and connected vehicles is mainly done through digital modeling. This requires a rich scenario library to enable the testing and verification of algorithms for driving perception, decision planning, and intelligent control.
The CICV has established a leading domestic scenario database for intelligent and connected vehicles, a virtual vehicle and human-machine interaction testing environment, and a wireless communication testing environment for complete vehicles. This can support full-scenario testing and application services from virtual simulation to real vehicle verification during the entire vehicle development process, potentially saving 70 percent of research and development costs for enterprises.
Utilizing the platforms it has built, the CICV is actively promoting and formulating relevant standard systems.
""Information security and communication security are prerequisites for the application of intelligent and connected vehicles, but there has always been a lack of unified standards and clear norms. The CICV has released a series of standards, providing a basis and direction for the information security testing of our products,"" said Xiao Ping, product manager of truck business at Pony.ai, an autonomous vehicle technology company.
In recent years, the CICV has released more than 20 standards to facilitate the construction of an integrated vehicle-road-cloud standard system.
