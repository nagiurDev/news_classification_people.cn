Homegrown reusable rocket one step closer
By Zhao Lei (China Daily) 08:34, January 23, 2024

A prototype of the ZQ 3 reusable carrier rocket undergoes a test at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China's Gobi Desert on Friday. CHINA DAILY
A recent test by LandSpace, a leading private space launch company in China, has moved the company closer to its goal of building the nation's first reusable carrier rocket, according to industry observers.
The Beijing-headquartered LandSpace, which shot the world's first methane-propelled rocket into orbit last year, carried out its first ""hop test"" — in which a rocket lifts off to a certain altitude and then makes a controlled vertical landing — at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China's Gobi Desert on Friday.
During the one-minute ""vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL)"" test, the experimental rocket reached a height of approximately 350 meters and then descended to softly land on a designated point with a descent speed of 0.75 meters per second and an accuracy of about 2.4 meters, according to the company.
The rocket's liftoff weight for the test was 50.3 metric tons, and it can contain more propellants in subsequent tests to a maximum overall weight of 68 tons, designers said.
Powered by a modified 80-ton-thrust TQ 12 methane engine, the experimental vehicle is 18.3 meters tall with a diameter of 3.35 meters, and is made of stainless steel.
""The rocket landed steadily and accurately, and remained in good condition. The flight was a complete success,"" LandSpace announced after the test, noting it laid a solid technical foundation for the maiden launch of its ZQ 3 reusable rocket.
Yang Yuguang, a senior space industry observer and vice-chair of the International Astronautical Federation's Space Transportation Committee, said on Monday that LandSpace's VTVL test was ""significant"" because it was a major step toward the completion of the ZQ 3 model, which has been designed to be made of stainless steel.
""Through the test flight, designers could verify the recovery plans of the ZQ 3's first core stage and the performance of the rocket's methane engine, flight control, landing guidance and touchdown buffer systems, and also could test procedures for a reusable rocket's launch, telemetry, recovery as well as maintenance.
""So far, two private Chinese enterprises have conducted VTVL tests of their own methane-fueled rockets, and I am sure they will be joined by more of their peers,"" he said.
Wang Yanan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the use of stainless steel bodies and methane engines has become a shared path for space companies to build reusable, environmentally friendly rockets, which will be pillars of human space exploration in the years to come.
He said the test by LandSpace testified to the company's ability to develop and operate sophisticated rocket technologies previously dominated by foreign companies.
""Private companies around the world are at the forefront of technological innovation in the space industry. We have witnessed the rapid advances made by the Chinese private sector in terms of rocket and satellite technologies, and their achievements will surely strengthen the country's competitiveness and capability in the global space industry,"" he said.
LandSpace said that based on Friday's success, the company will use the same experimental rocket to make test flights reaching a height of 10 kilometers in the near future, further verifying key technologies for the ZQ 3.
If everything goes according to plan, the first ZQ 3 will be assembled and make its debut flight in 2025.
According to the rocket maker, the ZQ 3 will be 76.6 meters tall and 4.5 meters wide, and will weigh nearly 660 metric tons when fully fueled.
With a liftoff thrust of 900 tons, it will be able to transport spacecraft with a combined weight of 21.3 tons into a low-Earth orbit.
The first stage of ZQ 3 is designed to be reused more than 20 times, said LandSpace.

Shenzhou-16 taikonauts meet press after return from space
 (Xinhua) 14:30, January 20, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- The three taikonauts from China's Shenzhou-16 crewed mission made their first public appearance in Beijing on Friday, 80 days subsequent to their return from space.
The Shenzhou-16 spaceship was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on May 30, 2023, carrying three crew members: Jing Haipeng, Zhu Yangzhu, and Gui Haichao. They stayed in orbit for 154 days, during which they conducted one extravehicular activity and delivered the fourth live class from the Tiangong space station.
Wearing four badges of honor from his successful spaceflights on his chest, commander Jing said his crew, for the first time, comprised a diverse trio of taikonauts from different career backgrounds, including aircraft pilot, flight engineer, and payload specialist.
""Professional handles professional affairs,"" said the senior pilot, adding that the division of work was clear-cut, each one being charged with specific tasks.
The Shenzhou-16 mission marked Jing's fourth journey into space, making him the most experienced taikonaut.
Flight engineer Zhu was responsible for the maintenance and repair of the space station platform. He said the greatest challenge was to ensure ""zero mistakes in daily operations"" during the five-month mission.
""We successfully completed the mission and ensured the safe, stable, efficient, and long-term operation of the space station,"" Zhu told the media.
Payload specialist Gui was the first civilian taikonaut to fly in space. ""Having the opportunity to participate in a multitude of cutting-edge research projects in space was an extraordinary experience, and I take great pride in it,"" Gui shared his feelings.
The spectacled university professor said he would incorporate the accomplishments attained throughout the space mission into his future scientific research endeavors, classroom instruction, and talent cultivation.
The three crew members were in good health. After the medical quarantine and recuperative care, they will undergo a health assessment before returning to normal training.

Rocket technology propels China's new-generation bobsled,2024-01-20,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0120/c90000-20124612.html,"Home>>
		
Rocket technology propels China's new-generation bobsled
 (Xinhua) 10:33, January 20, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology houses a dedicated workshop to manufacture rocket fairings and return capsules for bringing taikonauts back to Earth. However, it has now expanded its assembly line to include a new product - the bobsled.
Renowned for its awe-inspiring velocity and precision, the bobsled race is poised to become even swifter and fiercer as a novel sled crafted with Chinese rocket technology takes on the high-speed sporting slopes.
In collaboration with homegrown luxury auto brand Hongqi, the academy has recently presented the latest sled they co-created to the national bobsled team.
It marks a new milestone in their collaborative efforts to develop the third generation of the domestic bobsled. In January 2021, they unveiled the first version of a self-made sled. Subsequently, in September 2021, five months before the Beijing Winter Olympics, they delivered the second generation to the Chinese sports authorities.
As one of the fastest sports, bobsledding is a team event in which two to four people race down an ice track riding a specially designed sled, with the winning team completing the route in the shortest time. A bobsled in the race can achieve a speed ranging from 135 to 165 km per hour. The event has been a part of the Winter Games since its first edition in 1924.
However, China did not set up a national bobsled squad until 2016. In October 2019, researchers at the academy, China's leading rocket manufacturer, were tasked with designing the first homegrown racing bobsled.
Noting the critical nature of the equipment in the sport, they had hoped to take advantage of rocket material and aerospace engineering to make the Chinese team more competitive.
But none of the engineers had ever seen an actual sled.
""Constructing a previously unseen product within a year presented us with an immense challenge,"" lead researcher Zhou Yu recalled. ""Before this task, our knowledge of bobsledding was limited to mere glimpses from online imagery. However, the design and manufacturing process remained elusive.""
In the early stage of the project, there were only a few players and no racing track in China. Furthermore, the bobsleds purchased by the national team had been sent overseas due to training requirements, leaving no race sled available for research reference within China.
Zhou's team started with only a technical manual and two old models purchased from abroad, which they were not allowed to disassemble.
After weeks of study, they found that the rocketry aerodynamics and structural design could be adapted to help the sled's body minimize air resistance.
They chose carbon fiber composite, a lightweight material used in the rocket nose cones, as the sled's surface material.
In integrating rocket tech with the architecture of sports facilities, rocket scientists prioritized speed and safety. At the same time, car experts focused on comfort, making the sled tailored to suit the physique and customs of Chinese athletes.
According to the designers, the speed of the China-made sled exceeded 160 km per hour in tests, making it among the fastest in the world.
The third generation delivered a better performance on ice. Mao Kezhu, a senior engineer at the academy, said the new version adopts blended wing body architecture and design, further reducing air resistance by 13 percent compared to the previous generations, which can massively enhance the performance of athletes.
The academy now can produce up to 105 sleds per year.
""I would be very proud if Chinese athletes can ride the homegrown bobsleds, speeding down the ice track and obtaining good scores at the Winter Olympic Games,"" Zhou said.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The lunar lander developed by American private company Astrobotic Technology, dubbed Peregrine, has completed its controlled re-entry to Earth over open water in the South Pacific, the company confirmed on Friday.
The lander blasted off on United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket from Florida on Jan. 8. Shortly after separating from the spacecraft, Peregrine experienced a propulsion issue.
The propulsion issue ultimately prevented the lander from softly landing on the moon.
As expected, Astrobotic lost telemetry with the Peregrine spacecraft at around 3:50 p.m. Thursday Eastern Time, according to the company.
""While this indicates the vehicle completed its controlled re-entry over open water in the South Pacific at 4:04 p.m., we await independent confirmation from government entities,"" said the company in a release.
The company earlier revealed the plan of Peregrine's re-entering Earth's atmosphere and burning up. It would be the best approach to safely and responsibly conclude the mission.
The mission was planned to be the first time an American company sent a spacecraft to the moon, and the first time the United States returned to the lunar surface in more than 50 years.

Huawei and Xiaomi, for example, are developing new cars that offer ""an entire digital ecosystem,"" Dudenhoeffer said. ""This is much more than having a smart car,"" he said.
In a report released recently, Dudenhoeffer predicted that Chinese car manufacturers will become global market leaders in the automotive business in around 10 years, with BYD surpassing Toyota.
It is because the Chinese market ""has been growing very dynamically"" in the new energy vehicle (NEV) segment, Dudenhoeffer wrote in the report.

BYD increased its global sales by 309 percent in the last three years to more than 3 million units in 2023 and was ""clearly the market leader"" for NEVs, according to the report. Chinese start-up Li Auto saw an even faster growth of 318 percent last year, but it was still ""considerably smaller"" than BYD, with 376,000 new cars sold in 2023.
""China is the breeding ground for new car manufacturers that will play a central role in the electromobility segment of the automotive industry,"" Dudenhoeffer said, noting that the largest plant of U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla, measured by production figures, is currently located in China.

Interview: Int'l collaboration needed to keep earth habitable, says climate scientist
 (Xinhua) 13:26, January 19, 2024
DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- International collaboration is needed to manage the whole planet and keep it a habitable place, and China has a very important role in it, a leading scientist on global sustainability has said.
""The only way to solve the climate crisis is through collective action, we need global universal action, and that requires trust,"" said Johan Rockstroem, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and professor in Earth System Science at the University of Potsdam in an interview with Xinhua on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here on Tuesday.
The expert said climate change, together with geopolitical crisis and other pressing issues, still top the risk list at the forum this year.
Noting that the sharp rise in temperature in 2023 resulted in extreme events and ""the challenge is even larger than the immediate impacts,"" Rockstroem warned that the planet is approaching a tipping point, marked by the average temperature exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 level.
The World Meteorological Organization on Jan. 12 officially confirmed 2023 as the warmest year since records began, edging closer toward the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels set by the Paris Agreement.
In Rockstroem's view, to ""have a manageable climate future"" hinges on a singular approach: the gradual elimination of fossil fuels and a concerted effort to preserve nature, ensuring the planet remains resilient, healthy, and able to absorb and buffer.
He called for global governance to address the threats to the planet and concerted action across all planetary boundaries.
In 2009, Rockstroem and other 28 scientists proposed the concept of ""planetary boundaries,"" outlining limits to the impacts of human activities on the Earth system. The concept has since gained prominence in international policy discussions, not least at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.
More cooperation and more global governance collaboration across all the nine planetary boundaries would help jointly address the challenge of climate change, the expert said.
With regard to international collaboration, China plays a very important role in tackling climate change, Rockstroem said.
""China is a leader on the transition towards the solar and wind, and also a leader towards electric mobility, basically moving away from fossil fuel-based transport,"" he said. ""China also has a very mature agenda on ecological red lines, recognizing the value of keeping nature intact for security.""
Rockstroem said that the scientific community increasingly sees that China is playing a leadership role in finding pathways toward a modern, sustainable pathway for a large economy.
Speaking of economic growth and climate sustainability, Rockstroem said, ""More and more evidence shows that transitioning towards sustainability is the only pathway in the longer term for economic development.""

Initial phase of world's first commercial undersea data center maintains stable operation,2024-01-19,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0119/c90000-20124209.html,"Home>>
		
Initial phase of world's first commercial undersea data center maintains stable operation
 (People's Daily Online) 09:27, January 19, 2024
The first phase of the world's first commercial undersea data center has maintained stable operation since it was completed in Lingshui Li Autonomous County, south China's Hainan Province on Dec. 31, 2023.
A data center module weighing 1,300 tonnes for the undersea data center was previously installed successfully on the seabed at a depth of 35 meters off the shores of the county.

File photo shows a module of the undersea data center in Lingshui Li Autonomous County, south China's Hainan Province.
The undersea facility uses seawater to cool down the heat during its operation, saving energy, freshwater and land resources, said Pu Ding, general manager of the center's Hainan demonstration development project.
Pu added that the center also has the advantage of higher computing power density and strong computing power.
The sealed data center module ensures a dust-free and oxygen-free environment, providing further protection for electronic components and reducing the occurrence of malfunctions, according to Pu.
""The first batch of modules of the undersea data center was launched in December 2022. They are currently running stably. Compared with servers of the same volume, servers in the modules achieve an overall energy efficiency improvement of 40 to 60 percent, with the advantages of strong computing capability, low energy consumption, high security and low latency,"" Pu said.
The undersea data center will feature 100 modules. Compared to a traditional land-based data center of the same scale, once fully operational, it’s expected to save 122 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, 68,000 square meters of land, and 105,000 tonnes of freshwater per year.
Pu said that the modules have a design lifespan of 25 years. ""In the R&D and design process of the undersea data center, we fully considered the external impacts under extreme conditions, such as typhoons and earthquakes, and rolled out corresponding contingency plans,"" Pu said.
""A data center module operates as a 'supercomputer.' It can process over 4 million high-definition photos in a mere 30 seconds, a capacity equivalent to 60,000 traditional computers,"" said Li Jiawen, deputy general manager of Shenzhen HiCloud Data Center Technology Co., Ltd., the technical provider of the undersea data project.
""The construction of the Hainan Free Trade Port (FTP) has created a huge demand for offshore data centers.

Chinese, European scientists join hands to explore universe's mystery
 (Xinhua) 14:59, January 18, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- A new astronomical satellite, jointly developed by Chinese and European scientists, has been sent into space to explore the mysterious explosive phenomena and study the little-known side of the universe.
The Einstein Probe (EP), launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province on Jan. 9, is an international cooperative mission led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), involving the European Space Agency (ESA), the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Germany and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French space agency.
The probe is equipped with a wide-field X-ray telescope (WXT) consisting of 12 modules and a set of two units of follow-up X-ray telescope (FXT).
ESA and MPE contributed the key components of the FXT. ESA is participating in the EP project as a mission of opportunity and has provided support for testing and calibrating the X-ray detectors and the optics of WXT. ESA's ground stations will be used to help download the data, while the French space agency provided a VHF (very high frequency) ground receiving network for the real-time and fast downlink of scientific data, according to the project consortium.
In return, ESA and MPE will get access to 10 percent of the scientific data, and CNES will get 5 percent. The Chinese and European parties have also established a joint team of scientists, which will jointly carry out data analysis and scientific research after the launch.
""International cooperation has provided more opportunities for all parties involved to explore space, and at the same time, it is a process of mutual learning, and mutual benefits can be achieved,"" said Yuan Weimin, principal investigator of EP.
""I would like to congratulate our colleagues at CAS on the successful launch of an innovative mission that is set to make great strides in the field of X-ray astronomy,"" said Professor Carole Mundell, ESA's director of science. ""At ESA, we value international collaboration to advance science and deepen our understanding of the cosmos. I wish the Einstein Probe team a very successful mission.""
""EP will achieve a breakthrough in science through its powerful and novel instrumentation, which requires the combination of European and Chinese expertise. We look forward to the many new discoveries enabled by this successful collaboration,"" said Kirpal Nandra, director of MPE.
Cooperation between Chinese and European space scientists can be traced back nearly 20 years. China's Double Star space mission collaborated with ESA's Cluster mission in 2005 to achieve six-point coordinated measurements of the Earth's magnetosphere for the first time in human history. The joint international team was awarded the Laurels Team Achievement Award by the International Academy of Astronautics in 2010.
With the continuous development of China's space technology and science, an increasing number of countries are participating in China's space program.
International cooperation with scientists from countries such as Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Britain and Germany has been carried out in a series of China's space science missions including the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, the Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope, China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite and the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory.
The China-Europe joint space mission, Solar Wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (SMILE), is scheduled to enter space in 2025, according to Wang Chi, director of the National Space Science Center (NSSC) under CAS.
SMILE is a collaborative science mission between the CAS and ESA to build a deeper understanding of the Sun-Earth link by observing the dynamic interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere.
The SMILE mission is a very ambitious cooperation program executed with equal contributions from both entities. It demonstrates the close links between ESA and the NSSC/CAS, said Karl Bergquist, administrator of European and external relations of ESA.
""Space science in China has developed extremely fast in the last 10 years and is now at par with all the leading space powers,"" Bergquist said.
""Cooperation is very beneficial per se, and in particular when European and Chinese scientists study and work on the same topics, cooperating on mission development will reduce costs and push the scientific boundaries further,"" Bergquist added.

China's Nanchang carves out remarkable development path with LED technology,2024-01-18,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0118/c90000-20123717.html,"Home>>
		
China's Nanchang carves out remarkable development path with LED technology
By Zhu Lei (People's Daily) 10:45, January 18, 2024
About one out of every three smartphones worldwide utilizes silicon substrate-based LED for its phone flash. Similarly, for every three flashlights in the world, there is one with such technology.
In fact, many cities in China have extensively adopted silicon substrate-based LED chips for road and tunnel lighting.

Silicon substrate-based LED has become one of the three major technology pathways in the global LED industry. Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi province, is exactly where this technology started.
LED stands for light-emitting diode, which is a third-generation semiconductor light source. As an energy-saving and environmentally friendly cold light source, it is a fundamental component of the electronic information industry and has a wide range of applications.
At the beginning of this century, the common substrates for blue LED chips were sapphire or silicon carbide, and the two technical routes have been industrialized. However, the dominance of these technologies was largely held by developers outside China.
""At that time, we aimed at the unpopular technology direction of growing gallium nitride-based materials on silicon substrates,"" said Jiang Fengyi, a professor from Nanchang University. According to him, this was a path that had been almost abandoned by foreign developers.
In the production of LEDs, the growth of upstream materials to a large extent decides the LED color, brightness, lifespan, and other indicators. To produce LED chips, it is necessary to grow a gallium nitride light-emitting film on a substrate.
However, there are serious thermal and lattice mismatches between silicon and gallium nitride materials. Researchers around the world had not yet found an ideal solution despite years of efforts.
On Nov. 27, 2003, Jiang and his team embarked on a challenging exploration. In 2004, after more than 4,000 trial and error attempts, Jiang's team became the first in the world to overcome this key technical difficulty.

""This will be a brand new arena,"" said Wang Min, who worked together with Jiang. Wang keenly sensed the potential transformative impact this technology could bring to the industry.
Since then, Wang and Jiang co-founded tech firm LatticePower to promote the industrialization of silicon substrate-based blue LEDs. In October 2007, LatticePower officially settled in the Nanchang National High-tech Industrial Development Zone.
After years of development, in 2012, the company successfully achieved mass production of high-power LED chips on silicon substrates, which was praised as an annual news event by the International SSL Alliance.
In order to better open up the market, Wang decided to go for vertical integration - packaging LatticePower's own LEDs. In 2014, a ceramic packaging line was officially launched, enabling the mass production of its own ""light bulbs.""
Since then, LatticePower's LED products have made great strides with higher cost-effectiveness, eventually capturing around 30 percent of the global mobile lighting market. LatticePower Semiconductor Corporation, a subsidiary of LatticePower, boasts a monthly production capacity of up to 100 million units.
In the product showcase area of LatticePower, there are nearly 100 types of products on display, including large LED high-definition screens, streetlights, and smartphone flashlights. Today, LatticePower has grown into a leading semiconductor optoelectronic device manufacturer, offering products that span the entire industrial chain to customers worldwide.

In addition to the packaging line, LatticePower is continuously expanding its industrial ecosystem. With strong government support, it has attracted well-known venture capital funds such as GSR United Capital to establish sub-funds in Nanchang, successively incubated Lattice Lighting and Lattice Grand Technology, and introduced companies such as ShineOn and Kingsoon to promote the ecosystem of the silicon substrate-based LED industry.
Relying on silicon substrate-based LED technology, Nanchang has carved out a path of independent innovation in the global LED industry. Today, the technology continues to produce world-class innovative achievements such as yellow and red LEDs.
Driven by such innovation and the support of relevant government policies, Nanchang has established a complete LED industry chain, becoming the largest production base for high-power LED light sources in China.
In 2019, a 1-billion-yuan ($140.58 million) fund was established to amplify the application advantages of silicon substrate-based LED technology, which attracted a number of leading domestic LED companies such as Shenzhen MTC, Xiamen Changelight, and Hongli Zhihui Group. In 2022, the LED industry in Nanchang achieved a revenue of 21.2 billion yuan.
According to the plan, the city will focus on the manufacturing and packaging of LED chips to build itself into a ""light valley."" In particular, the Nanchang National High-tech Industrial Development Zone will concentrate on building a complete LED industry chain cluster with a focus on silicon substrate-based LEDs, and the Nanchang Economic and Technological Development Zone will prioritize the development of basic materials, chip packaging, and terminal applications. Besides, other districts and counties will focus on developing supporting links in the industrial chain. The goal is to expand Nanchang's LED industry scale to 50 billion yuan by 2026.

Dear taikonauts, your order on its way, keep an eye out for it! Carrying over 260 items of cargo that weighs about 5.6 tons, China's Tianzhou-7, currently the world's mightiest cargo spacecraft, is sailing toward the China Space Station after an awe-inspiring take-off from a Long March-7 carrier rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Site in South China's tropical island province of Hainan at 10:27 pm on Wednesday.
According to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), after a flight of 10 minutes, the Tianzhou-7 spacecraft entered its preset orbit, marking the full success of the launch mission.
The Wednesday launch mission also marked a first of the four China manned space program missions scheduled for 2024. According to a previous official release, China plans to launch the Shenzhou-18 and Shenzhou-19 crewed missions to the China Space Station in 2024, along with the two planned cargo runs to the Chinese permanent space outpost.
Orbiting Earth about 400 kilometers above the ground, the China Space Station, which is also known as Tiangong, meaning the heavenly palace, has three permanent parts — a core module and two science capsules — and is regularly connected to several visiting crew and cargo spaceships.
The Long March-7 rocket is a new generation medium-lift launch vehicle developed to meet the needs of launching cargo spacecraft for the China Space Station.
It has a low Earth orbit carrying capacity of 14 tons and is affectionately referred to as the ""space station cargo express."" Wednesday's launch marks the seventh joint venture of the Long March-7 rocket with the Tianzhou cargo spacecraft into space, the Global Times learned from the rocket developer China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT).
In the second half of 2024, the Long March-7 rocket will also launch the Tianzhou-8 cargo spacecraft, and will also launch other satellites using the expedition upper stage, according to the academy.
Zhou Ning, a member of the Long March-7 launching team with the CALT, said that the team has always strived for ""continuous optimization."" The comprehensive performance of the rocket's systems has been continuously enhanced, and the testing and launching cycle has been reduced from the initial 38 days to the current 25 days, according to Zhou.
The launch on Wednesday marked the 507th flight of the Long March rocket class.
The Tianzhou-7 cargo spacecraft is the seventh of its kind developed by the China Academy of Spacecraft Technology (CAST,) and it carries over 260 items of cargo weighing approximately 5.6 tons, Li Zhiyong, an engineer with the CAST, said on Wednesday.
The Tianzhou-7 cargo spacecraft is loaded with experimental payloads, custom cargo packages, and other large items, each weighing over 100 kilograms. These are used for the space station's in-orbit operation, space in-orbit scientific experiments, and taikonaut life support.
It includes 2,400 kilograms of living essentials for taikonauts including special goods for the upcoming Chinese New Year of the Dragon, fresh fruit, vegetables, and gift packages. The packaging design has been optimized for longer storage time and fresher contents.
Tianzhou-7 is an upgraded model of fully sealed cargo spacecraft, possessing the world's largest active cargo transportation capacity, the highest freight efficiency, and the most comprehensive in-orbit support capabilities, Li told the Global Times.
While ensuring a stable performance of the spacecraft, we have also carried out some system upgrades to the Tianzhou, such as enabling it to conduct an ultrafast rendezvous and docking with the China Space Station, the CAST expert explained.
After entering orbit, Tianzhou-7 will use a rapid rendezvous and docking approach, and dock at the rear port of the Tianhe space station core module to form a combined structure in only three hours, which is considerably shorter than the conventional 6.5 hours, he explained.
This optimized approach offers greater flexibility and a wider range of adaptability, further enhancing the cargo spacecraft's autonomous rendezvous and docking capabilities. This also enriches the modes of rendezvous and docking, further advancing the development of rendezvous and docking technology, Li hailed.
To support the continuous rollout of space experiments aboard the China Space Station, Tianzhou-7 mission will deliver new experimental payloads, experimental units and samples, experimental consumables, spare parts, and other application materials for in-orbit experiments, said Liu Wei, chief designer of the space application system for the Tianzhou-7 mission.
With the Tianzhou-7 mission, the space application system plans to send 16 standard cargo packages, one set of cell life support devices, and one set of 4 C microfluidic chips to the space station. In total, there will be 61 sets of products, weighing approximately 473 kilograms, to be sent to the Tiangong, according to Liu.
After these application materials are transported to the space station, they will be transferred to the experimental facilities onboard for conducting 33 scientific experiments in areas such as space life science, space materials science, microgravity, fluid physics, and combustion science, Liu noted.

WENCHANG, Hainan, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- China launched cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-7 on Wednesday night to deliver supplies for its orbiting Tiangong space station, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
The Long March-7 Y8 rocket, carrying Tianzhou-7, blasted off at 10:27 p.m. (Beijing Time) from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in the southern island province of Hainan, the CMSA said.
After about 10 minutes, Tianzhou-7 separated from the rocket and entered its designated orbit. Its solar panels soon unfolded. The agency declared the launch a complete success.
Wednesday's launch is the first mission of China's manned space project this year. It is also the 507th mission of the Long March rocket series.
The mission is the sixth flight of the space station cargo delivery system consisting of the Tianzhou cargo craft and the Long March-7 carrier rocket.
The cargo craft and launch vehicle were respectively developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) and the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, both of which are affiliated with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
Tianzhou-7 will take three hours for the rendezvous and docking with the space station. Previous Tianzhou missions regularly took about 6.5 hours in rendezvous and docking. The exception was the Tianzhou-5 mission, which only took about two hours.
Tianzhou-7 will adopt a new mode of rendezvous and docking yet to be verified in orbit, which is expected to give better play to the guidance, navigation, and control systems of the spacecraft, according to Li Zhiyong, a researcher at the CAST.
Tianzhou-7 is the seventh cargo craft developed by the CAST. ""As an improved fully-sealed cargo craft, it has the largest cargo transport capacity, the highest cargo-delivery efficiency, and the most complete in-orbit support capability in the world,"" said Li.
Tianzhou-7 carries more than 260 items of supplies, including those for the astronaut system, space station system, application tasks, and cargo spacecraft system, as well as other engineering goods, featuring a variety of cargo and large-sized items. The total weight of onboard materials reached about 5.6 tonnes.
Customized cargo packages for experiment payloads and other large-scale goods, each weighing over 100 kilograms, will be applied in the operation of the space station, space science experiments, and astronaut life support.
Tianzhou-7 also sends 2,400 kilograms of living supplies for the astronauts, including Lunar New Year goods and fresh fruits and vegetables. The packaging design has been optimized to ensure longer storage time and freshness.
The application system has loaded Tianzhou-7 with a total of 61 items weighing 473 kilograms, including experiment payloads, experiment units and samples, consumable items, and spare parts, to support continuous space experiments, according to Liu Wei, a researcher at the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The items also contain a set of life support devices to keep cell samples in good condition during this mission and a set of microfluidic chips with the temperature kept at 4 degrees Celsius, said Liu.
Those items will be transferred to the space station's experiment facility to carry out a total of 33 scientific experiments, such as the effect of space microgravity on human bone cells, the propellant fluid transport and stability under variable gravity, and the growth of nano precious metals in solution under microgravity. The experiments cover fields such as space life science, space material science, microgravity fluid physics, and combustion science, Liu added.
According to the plan, China will launch the Tianzhou-8 cargo spacecraft from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site this year. The site is the country's fourth launch site and the only one by the seaside.

BEIJING, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Beijing high-level autonomous driving demonstration area launched a road test of unmanned police patrol cars on Tuesday, the first of its kind in China.
Fifteen self-driving patrol cars, complete with flashing lights, hit the public roads in the autonomous driving demonstration area, performing round-the-clock police duties in coordination with officers from the Daxing Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau.
The duties being tested include patrolling, ensuring security for large-scale events, public announcements, issuing warnings and emergency rescue work.
""The unmanned patrol cars possess Level 4 autonomous driving technology. They can complete battery replacement in 30 seconds and have a driving range of 100 km,"" said Zhang Weiling, senior vice president of Neolix, developer of the patrol cars.
The vehicles feature a 360-degree multi-sensor fusion perception capability with a detection range of up to 120 meters. The powerful onboard computing platform can calculate and respond based on road conditions in real time, thus ensuring vehicle driving safety.
The unmanned vehicle team will patrol an area of 60 square km in the Beijing high-level autonomous driving demonstration area.
Since Beijing initiated the autonomous driving demonstration area in September 2020, it has built 160 square km of area equipped with intelligent connected roads and a dedicated smart city network.
A total of 28 vehicle testing companies are operating in the demonstration area. Over 800 vehicles are now engaged in testing and commercial exploration, with a cumulative test mileage exceeding 20 million km.
