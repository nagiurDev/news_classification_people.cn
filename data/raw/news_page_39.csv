Shenzhen completes construction of 362 supercharging stations, surpassing gas station count
 (Global Times) 15:20, May 06, 2024
Shenzhen, in South China’s Guangdong Province, has constructed 362 supercharging stations for new energy vehicles (NEVs) as of April 30, exceeding the number of traditional gas stations, according to the local development and reform commission. The number of charging ports in the city has also surpassed that of gas pumps, reflecting the positive trend in Shenzhen’s NEV market development and the effective operation of its charging infrastructure.
The increase in the number of supercharging stations has notably boosted the charging efficiency of NEVs. Statistics from the Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau of China Southern Power Grid show that in the first quarter, Shenzhen saw a surge in NEV charging, reaching 670 million kilowatt-hours, marking a 10.9 percent year-on-year increase, indicating a thriving market for NEVs in Shenzhen.
For a household NEV, it usually takes 7 to 8 hours to fully charge using a standard charging pile, 1 to 2 hours using a fast charging pile, whereas with a supercharging pile, it can reach 80 percent or more in just 10 minutes or even less, enabling a ""coffee break, fully charged and ready to go"" scenario, significantly enhancing the charging experience.
On June 29, 2023, Shenzhen debuted its first fully liquid-cooled supercharging demonstration station and officially launched the ""city of supercharging stations"" initiative. At present, the supercharging service network has been preliminarily established across the city, with most stations leveraging existing public charging infrastructure and strategically situated in major commercial centers, bus terminals, industrial parks, and other key locations.
Under a plan for NEV supercharging facilities, Shenzhen aims to establish a globally cutting-edge infrastructure and versatile service system for supercharging facilities by the end of 2024. The plan also emphasizes advancing the interactive mechanism for electricity demand allocation, hastening coordination among enterprises, technologies, scenarios, and beyond.
Data shows that by the end of 2023, the number of NEVs in Shenzhen has surpassed 970,000, with NEVs constituting over 60 percent of new car sales. By the end of 2025, the scale of NEVs in Shenzhen is expected to reach 1.3 million units.

Students and alumni of more than 100 Chinese universities celebrated this year's May 4th, known as Youth Day in China, by composing original songs using AI (artificial intelligence) technology.
Titled ""The 1st China AIMV 'May 4th Youth Music Festival' Co-creation,"" a non-profit music event was held online on Saturday night. The two-hour event mainly consisted of edited versions of some 120 songs about campus life and the spirit of youth.
Notably, the songs broadcast at the event were all made with AIGC (AI-generated content) tools such as the text-to-song generator Suno and the text-to-video model Sora, according to the event's co-organizer China AIGC Industry Alliance (AIGCxChina), a nationwide civil group of industry insiders.
The youth-themed AI music co-creation event collected songs from universities across the country from April 14 to 30, said Chen Duo, a AIGCxChina member who initiated and directed the event.
The song collection period was short as it only takes a little time to make a song and a corresponding MV (music video) for the song with the help of AI technology, Chen said.
""Therefore, the event enabled young students to get closer to today's AI tech, and provided them with a good opportunity to learn and make something themselves using AIGC tools - in a very short period of time,"" Chen told the Global Times on Sunday.
Chen added that more than 60 percent of the participants were new to AIGC technology. To help them get started quickly, the event organizers shared a package of AIGC tools that every one could download for free, and Chen personally did six free online lectures in late April to teach people to use the tools.
Producing a song with AI tech is much easier than most people think, Chen said. He recalled that at the beginning of the song collection period, many participants experienced some anxiety and uncertainty.
""They thought of AIGC as a complex cutting-edge technology and assumed it would be difficult to learn, so they participated in the event out of pure curiosity,"" Chen said. ""They were not sure whether they could handle the tools and complete a song by themselves in just a few days.""
Echoing Chen's words, Yang Ruxu, a Xiamen University (XMU) student majoring in piano performance, said that she had always considered AIGC tools to be very ""high-end"" and removed from ordinary people. During this music event however, she quickly got familiar with the tools and eventually contributed to three of the 10 songs that her university submitted.
“This event made me get closer to AI,” Yang told the Global Times.
Over 100 universities from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, Including XMU, submitted some 200 songs to the event organizers. The Saturday event broadcast 120 of them, attracting an audience of nearly 200,000 from home and abroad.
""I feel like the quality is high enough that it's not distracting by the fact that it's AI, so high that the audience is not at all distracted by the fact it's AI-generated"" commented Valentine, a Russian AI industry insider who lives in the US. ""All the videos that we've seen really show the amount of work that went into them, and I think we can really congratulate all the students for their hard work, playing the game without holding anything back,” praised French music enthusiast Etienne.
Chen hopes the event will inspire more young Chinese to explore AIGC creation. ""The original intention that we initiated this event is to promote the popularity of AIGC applications in China,"" he told the Global Times. ""I hope that young people, when faced with new concepts and technologies, will have the courage to face handle them.""
Although it is a novelty at present, AIGC tools are spreading rapidly and may become as common as Word and Excel in the near future, Chen predicted.

Chinese satellite detects over 100 solar white-light flares,2024-05-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0506/c90000-20165035.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese satellite detects over 100 solar white-light flares
 (Xinhua) 11:07, May 06, 2024
NANJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) -- dubbed Kuafu-1 in Chinese -- has detected more than 100 solar white-light flares since its launch in October 2022, according to the Purple Mountain Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Solar white-light flares are a type of flare that exhibits enhanced radiation in the visible light continuum spectrum. These flares typically have high energy and can have an impact on space weather, causing disruptions or interruptions in ground communication, as well as interfering with the normal operation of spacecraft.
Before the launch of ASO-S, the observation and reporting of solar white-light flares were limited to around 300 cases, which accounted for a relatively small proportion of the total number of flare eruptions.
The research team of the satellite has analyzed 205 high-energy flares that occurred between October 2022 and May 2023. Among them, 49 white-light flares were identified, resulting in a white-light flare occurrence rate of 24 percent, which is significantly higher than the previously observed data.
The observation data from ASO-S shows that white-light flares are not as rare as previously thought, said Gan Weiqun, the chief scientist of the KuaFu-1 mission and a researcher at the Purple Mountain Observatory.
The satellite team will continue to combine multi-wavelength observations from other satellites for comprehensive study of white-light flares to provide a theoretical basis for the country's space weather forecasting, Gan said.
ASO-S is a comprehensive solar observation satellite used for solar research. It was officially handed over to the Purple Mountain Observatory in September 2023.
Since its launch, the satellite has recorded approximately 600TB of raw solar observation data, providing a wealth of material for subsequent research.
The new study was published recently in the journals Solar Physics and The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- With the return on Tuesday of the Shenzhou-17 manned spacecraft, a new batch of scientific experimental samples from China's space station have arrived on Earth, including seeds for breeding experiments.
Forage seeds, including alfalfa and oats, provided by the Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, underwent 11 months of space radiation on the space radiation biology exposure equipment aboard the space station.
After basic checks at the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the seeds were sent to a research team from the Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences for experimental research.
The researchers have started seed germination experiments on the seeds and will further conduct ground-based breeding experiments to obtain excellent mutants and cultivate superior new forage varieties with higher yield, better quality and stronger resistance, said Yang Hongshan, the team's chief scientist.
The research results are expected to significantly enhance China's competitiveness in the field of agricultural science and technology, providing strong support for the sustainable development of agriculture in the country, Yang said.
The research team has successfully cultivated three new varieties of alfalfa and one new variety of oats through space-mutation breeding. These varieties have been widely promoted and applied in production.
