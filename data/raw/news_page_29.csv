Chinese, British scientists retrieve lost wheat genetic diversity, empowering modern breeding
 (Xinhua) 09:13, June 19, 2024
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A collaborative study led by scientists from China and Britain revealed that at least 60 percent of the genetic diversity found in a historic collection of wheat is unused, providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve modern wheat and achieve food security.
The study, jointly conducted by a research team from the Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the John Innes Centre in Britain, as well as other research organizations, was published in the latest issue of the academic journal Nature.
Wheat is one of the most important global food crops for humans. Faced with a series of challenges such as the continuous growth of global population, complex climate change and the gradual slowing down of the cultivation of new wheat varieties, scientists urgently need to find efficient and precise methods for wheat breeding to cultivate high-yield and high-quality new varieties, said Cheng Shifeng, the Chinese leading scientist in the study.
Cheng's team introduced from Britain a historic collection of wheat gathered in the 1920s and 1930s from 32 countries, which are no longer grown anywhere in the world. Experiments have been carried out across China, along with a comparative analysis of the nearly century-old wheat with modern wheat varieties.
By using cutting-edge technologies such as genomics, genetics, bio-informatics and molecular biology, scientists built a wheat genomic variation map, and revealed that modern wheat varieties have lost over 60 percent of their genetic diversity through long-term artificial selection.
""This missing 60 percent discovered in this study is full of beneficial genes that we need to feed people sustainably,"" said Simon Griffiths, group leader at the John Innes Centre.
""We can retrace a huge set of novel, functional and beneficial diversity that were lost in modern wheat varieties, and now have the opportunity to add them back into elites in the breeding programs,"" said Cheng.
In addition, the research team has discovered new genes and thousands of genetic variation sites in wheat for high yield, high calcium content, lodging resistance, efficient nitrogen use, resistance to blast and leaf spot diseases. They have developed genomics and genetics resources and new tools useful for wheat research and breeding.
""This study has huge potential for future genetic improvement of wheat, and can be used to cultivate new wheat varieties with high yield and quality, stress resistance and adaptability to climate change,"" said Li Jiayang, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
Qian Qian, another CAS academician, commented that the astounding discovery offers significant inspiration and guidance for wheat breeding, and providing valuable genetic information for the innovative use of germplasm resources.
""This study has opened up endless possibilities for utilizing ancient germplasm resources to improve modern wheat breeding. It has epoch-making significance for wheat breeding in China and even the world,"" said Chu Chengcai, a professor with the South China Agricultural University.

Chinese researchers find mental well-being key to healthy aging
 (Xinhua) 09:00, June 19, 2024
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have found that mental well-being is associated with healthy aging regardless of socioeconomic status and it plays an important role in promoting longevity and resilience in aging, the China Science Daily reported Tuesday.
The research team from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine analyzed the effects of mental health on various aging outcomes using publicly available genetic data from populations of European descent.
The analysis of multiple datasets, including one with up to 2.3 million people, showed that individuals with better mental well-being tended to experience healthier aging, characterized by increased resilience, higher self-rated health levels and greater longevity.
The researchers also found that income, education and occupation are all related to better mental health, with increased income having the strongest association. In addition, reducing sedentary lifestyles and smoking, along with increasing the intake of cheese and fruit, may contribute to better mental well-being and healthier aging.
The findings underscored the necessity of integrating mental health support into public health policy and aging research. The research team also noted that interventions to promote mental health may be a viable strategy to enhance healthy aging across different groups of people.
The study was published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.

On May 25, XPeng Aeroht, a leading player in the aerial mobility industry, let its flying car, the X2, fly over the Shenzhen central business district in Guangdong province for the first time, giving a sneak peek into the future of urban transportation.
The event was a milestone not only for XPeng Aeroht, an affiliate of Chinese smart carmaker Xpeng, but also for the burgeoning low-altitude economy in China.
Its X2, a two-seater electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, took off vertically from Shenzhen's talent park square, flying around the park at an altitude of 30 meters. The vehicle, designed and manufactured by XPeng Aeroht, operated entirely in autonomous mode, providing a bird's-eye view of Shenzhen's landmark buildings.
Before this public unveiling, the X2 had undergone nearly 6,000 test flights in various environments, including CBDs, coastal areas, deserts, and rivers, ensuring its reliability and safety in different conditions.
Shenzhen is committed to advancing new economic sectors, including the low-altitude economy and smart connected vehicles, the municipal government said in its 2024 transport work report.
This initiative aims to leverage ""small scene innovation"" to drive ""large industry development"", accelerating the establishment of a ""Sky City"" with integrated low-altitude management, panoramic applications, and industrial clustering.
Eyeing the big opportunity, XPeng Aeroht said it is currently focused on developing its first mass-production model, the ""Land Aircraft Carrier"", a modular flying car expected to revolutionize personal transportation.
The Land Aircraft Carrier comprises two main parts: a ground vehicle and a flying module. The ground vehicle can house the flying module for terrestrial travel and can seamlessly transition into a flying car, the company said.
""Pre-orders for the Land Aircraft Carrier are set to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024, with production and deliveries planned for the fourth quarter of 2025. The estimated price for this innovative vehicle is over 1 million yuan ($138,000),"" said Zhao Deli, founder and president of XPeng Aeroht.
XPeng Aeroht's daring mirrors a broader trend and enthusiasm for the low-altitude economy in China.
Though an official definition has yet to be agreed upon, the concept of a ""low-altitude economy"" is generally understood by economists as a range of business activities occurring within airspace up to 1,000 meters above ground.
It encompasses both manned and unmanned civilian aircraft operations. These activities include passenger transportation, air tourism, cargo delivery as well as the manufacturing, maintenance and integrated services associated with related equipment.
In March, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and three other ministerial-level departments unveiled an ambitious plan to form a trillion-yuan-level market in general aviation equipment.
The plan to integrate general aviation equipment comprehensively into people's jobs and daily lives by 2030 will give a strong boost to the development of the low-altitude economy, including eVTOL aircraft, experts said.
The plan aims to capitalize on advancements in unmanned, electric and intelligent technologies to propel the commercial application of new-generation general aviation equipment in urban air transportation, logistics distribution and emergency rescue operations.
China is seeking to lead in the development of green and intelligent general aviation aircraft, positioning itself at the forefront of global innovation.
Wu Peixin, an independent aviation industry analyst in Beijing, said this is the latest signal from the Chinese government that the country attaches great importance to the development of the low-altitude economy.
According to the plan, key initiatives include the establishment of joint laboratories, technology innovation centers and tech innovation service platforms in the general aviation sector. Additionally, efforts will be directed toward laying the groundwork for a robust regulatory and safety verification system, while demonstrating the tangible benefits of aviation emergency rescue and logistics distribution on a large scale.

A humanoid robot developed by a company in the Zhangjiang AI Robot Valley, Shanghai, has gained new capabilities. Apart from walking rapidly and avoiding obstacles, it is now able to wave its two robotic arms freely, recognize different scenes, and learn. The robot may perform many professions in the future.
""Previously, such technological upgrades would take at least three to five years. Now, with the training by AI large models, the robot has upgraded in just half a year,"" said Gu Jie, founder of Fourier Intelligence, the developer of the humanoid robot.
According to Gu, the rehabilitation robots developed by the company have been commissioned in more than 2,000 medical institutions.
Speaking of the changes in Zhangjiang, Gu, who has been running a business there for many years, said: ""More and more multinational companies and innovative companies are settling in Zhangjiang, making it easy for us to seek all kinds of talent, upstream and downstream companies, and application scenarios.""
In recent years, Shanghai, strengthening its efforts to build itself into a source of technological innovation, has followed a development pattern driven by both technological innovation and institutional innovation, accelerated its stride toward becoming a globally influential science and technology innovation center, and achieved a significant leap in its comprehensive scientific and technological strength as well as overall innovation efficiency.
Shanghai has made a series of major scientific and technological breakthroughs in domestically-produced large aircraft, domestically-built cruise ships, deep space exploration, and deep-sea endeavors. It has also achieved many ""firsts"" in somatic cell monkey cloning and single chromosome eukaryotic cells.
Shanghai continues to lead the nation with a high-value invention patent ownership of 50.2 per 10,000 people. The framework for building Shanghai into an international science and technology innovation center has basically been done, and Shanghai is now accelerating efforts to strengthen its functions.
The construction of upgrades to the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), a key sci-tech infrastructure to reveal the mysteries of the microscopic world, passed the national inspection and acceptance in Shanghai on May 15, which will greatly improve the experimental research capabilities of the light source.
""The SSRF is like a 'scientific research aircraft carrier', bringing together a group of top scholars and outstanding teams from home and abroad. At present, we are intensively conducting preliminary research on next-generation light source facilities to pursue brighter and stronger light beams,"" said Zhao Zhentang, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and director of the SSRF.

Recently, leading Chinese companies in the large model sector, including ByteDance, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud and Zhipu AI, have announced significant reductions in the prices of their generative artificial intelligence (AI) large models and related services.
Many of these companies have lowered their prices by more than 50 percent, and some products have even seen price reductions exceeding 90 percent.
""I often encounter problems when programming, and at such times, large models are a great source of inspiration. The price reduction of large models offers people more choices and lowers the threshold for usage, thus significantly improving work and learning efficiency,"" said Feng Yepeng, a computer science student at a university in Beijing.
Luo Yiran, who works in network operations in Wuhan, central China's Hubei province, said that the user experience of domestic large models has been continuously improving in recent years, meeting her practical needs such as seeking inspiration for planning and collecting background information.
In her opinion, it is a positive trend to reduce prices in a timely manner as application scenarios continue to expand.
In participating in this ""price reduction trend,"" large model service providers have their own considerations.
Some hope to explore more application scenarios.
Shen Dou, executive vice president of Baidu and chief of Baidu AI Cloud Group, said that the development of AI needs support from new development paradigms and new technological tools. By reducing the price of certain products and making some core large models free, Baidu is minimizing the cost of trial and error in its innovation, Shen explained.
""Price is just one factor that consumers consider when choosing large models. Compared to price, they consider the models' effectiveness, application scenarios, and successful cases more important. Through price reductions, we hope to quickly explore and replicate more potential application scenarios for large models,"" Shen said.
Besides, some companies hope to release market potential through price reductions.
Through its self-developed Tongyi AI model family, Alibaba Cloud has built a matrix of foundational models and industry-specific models. Senior expert Zhu Xunyao of Alibaba Cloud noted that the price reductions aim to make large models affordable for more ordinary users and small- and medium-sized enterprises, therefore accelerating the release of potential in the market of AI application.
Zhu said that for Alibaba Cloud, the cost for users to use large-scale models mainly lies in the computational resources consumed during model inference, which are significantly lower on the public cloud compared to private deployment.
""We have greatly reduced the cost of model inference based on a series of key technologies and products we have developed. The technological dividends, economies of scale, and cost advantages brought by the public cloud have boosted our confidence in lowering prices and seizing the market,"" Zhu said.

Behind the price reductions lie the efforts and hopes of many large model providers and even internet companies to empower work and life with AI.
Zhang Peng, CEO of Zhipu AI, believes that the development of AI technology has entered a new stage. However, he said, there is still a significant gap between the improvement of the technology curve and enabling more people to benefit from the powerful productivity of AI. There is still much work to be done in effectively utilizing the capabilities of large models to help people in their work, learning, and daily lives, he added.
Wang Peng, associate researcher with the Institute of Management of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, noted that with the continuous development and optimization of large model technology, the marginal time and resources required for model training are gradually decreasing.
In particular, algorithm improvements, computational efficiency enhancements, and declining hardware costs have made it possible to reduce the price of large models, Wang said.
From this perspective, the underlying reasons for the current wave of price reductions for large models in both domestic and international markets are generally similar. Major manufacturers aim to promote the popularization and application of AI technology through price reductions.
""On the one hand, price reductions make large model services more affordable, effectively expanding the market size and user base. On the other hand, significant price reductions in the short term will intensify market competition and prompt large model providers to continuously improve service quality to retain users,"" Wang said.
Over time, inefficient or underfunded businesses may be eliminated, while distinctive but difficult-to-scale businesses may be merged, Wang added.
Experts generally believe that the large model industry needs to explore diverse application scenarios, focus on data quality and privacy protection, diversify revenue sources, and improve user feedback mechanisms, so as to achieve healthier and more sustainable development.

BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhou-18 crew members on board China's orbiting space station recently conducted a number of space science experiments and tests, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
In video footage released by the CMSA, the three astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu tested the strength of manual performance in the Tianhe core module, including two-arm and single-arm push and pull strength tests and the two-arm rotational strength test.
By collecting data from various manual strength categories in different stages of the space flight, these tests will compare and analyze the difference of astronauts' operation strength in space and on Earth in an effort to better understand strength changes in microgravity environments.
In the field of space medicine, the crew members carried out tests concerning muscle adaptability. Using equipment such as a bicycle, treadmill and resistance exercise device, they completed tests on Achilles tendon stiffness, lower limb kinematics, plantar pressure and others. These tests will help establish a prediction model for exercise protective efficacy for muscle atrophy in weightlessness.
During their stay in orbit, the trio will carry out over 90 experiments and tests in the fields of space material science, space life science and space technology.
China launched the Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship on April 25, sending three astronauts to its orbiting Tiangong space station for a six-month mission.

China advances space mission with Europe amid ambitious exploration agenda
 (Xinhua) 15:21, June 17, 2024
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The development of in-orbit detectors for a joint China-Europe space mission has been completed, and they are poised for integration into a satellite platform located in Europe within the year, according to the mission's chief scientist.
The Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (SMILE) is a joint mission between the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the European Space Agency (ESA) that aims to deepen the understanding of the Sun-Earth connection by observing the dynamic interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere.
SMILE is scheduled for launch in 2025 from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, said Wang Chi, director of the National Space Science Center (NSSC) of CAS, at the first International Conference on Space Science and Technology, hosted by Beijing Institute of Technology, on Saturday.
At the meeting, Wang highlighted China's forward-looking agenda for its space exploration, emphasizing pioneering research into dark matter and gravitational waves in space, the search for habitable planets and signs of alien life, and the advancement of space-based biological and physical science.
Wang unveiled the Hongmeng project, also known as Discovering the Sky at the Longest Wavelengths (DSL), which is an innovative endeavor set to open a window on the Dark Ages of the universe using megahertz-level radio waves. The mission is designed to include one mother satellite and nine daughter satellites operating in a 300-kilometer circular lunar orbit, Wang said.
Also on the roadmap for China's deep-space exploration, the Earth 2.0 mission will see an array of telescopes sent into the Earth-Sun L2 orbit to explore habitable, Earth-like planets outside the solar system.
Wang also cited the Enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) project, which will launch payloads into a highly elliptical orbit to explore still-mysterious celestial bodies like black holes and neutron stars.
The eXTP project has already reached out to scientists from more than 20 countries, including Italy, Germany and France, with offers to cooperate.
China is also expected to launch satellites such as Taiji-2 into a solar orbit to form a constellation with Taiji-1, which was sent into space in 2019, and undertake space-based gravitational wave detection, according to Wang.
French space scientist Pierre-Yves Meslin outlined the progress of Detection of Outgassing RadoN (DORN), a scientific instrument developed by French scientists and carried by China's Chang'e-6 lander, and praised the successful cooperation between France and China.
A consortium of scientists from China, France and Russia also presented their latest findings and perspectives in the field of space science at the meeting.

Chinese researchers dedicated to restoring underwater ""grassland""
 (Xinhua) 09:06, June 17, 2024
JINAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Carrying an oxygen tank and wearing a diving suit, Zhang Peidong, a professor from the Ocean University of China (OUC), dived into a sea area off the city of Weihai in east China's Shandong Province, to take samples from the seabed and bring them back for testing.
""I've been diving for 16 years but I'm still excited every time I dive down as I can see an underwater 'grassland' thriving with fish, shellfish, sea cucumbers and other marine animals. The atmosphere full of life and vigor is pleasing,"" noted Zhang.
The underwater ""grassland"" is the seafloor covered with seagrass, also known as seagrass beds. It is the habitat and shelter of various marine life. However, due to the human activities and changes in natural environment, a large number of seagrass beds disappeared globally.
In 2008, Zhang, who just obtained his doctorate from the OUC, and Li Wentao, who was then pursuing a doctorate at the same university, came to Rongcheng Bay in Weihai, a representative area of seagrass beds in the country and found that the problem was quite worrying.
""The number of overwintering swans has plummeted in the local Swan Lake due to the significant decrease in seagrass, a major source of food for the birds,"" Li said.
The submarine ecological crisis drove the two men to adjust their research direction from aquaculture to the seabed ecological restoration, which received little attention at the time.
A Weihai-based company Mashan Group was also interested in the marine ecology protection and has since provided various support free of charge including workshops, office space, catering and accommodation, and manpower for the research team.
Wang Xiaodong, general manager of the company, said that most of the company's employees are the children of fishermen who are willing to do something for the restoration of seagrass beds.
After a long time of hard work, the research team developed an artificial cultivation technology of eelgrass seedling after figuring out the growth rules and the best timing to pick seeds.
The technology advancement shortens the eelgrass seeds germination stage from nearly three months in the natural environment to just 10 days.
Researchers have also developed several sets of equipment with independent intellectual property rights to improve the planting efficiency.
During the past 16 years, the research team has participated in more than 10 submarine ecological restoration projects in the country, restoring and maintaining more than 1,333 hectares of seagrass beds in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. The Mashan Group, due to its deep cooperation with the research team, has also grown into an important force in the marine ecological restoration projects in Shandong Province.
Currently, more than 40 percent of Swan Lake's seagrass beds have been restored, attracting an increasing number of swans to the area to spend winter. The seagrass bed restoration technology has also been applied in other provinces such as Hebei and Liaoning, boosting the local water quality and biodiversity.

Chinese researchers develop mini, injectable device for monitoring intracranial physiology
 (Xinhua) 08:59, June 17, 2024
WUHAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has created a mini injectable ultrasonic sensor for wireless monitoring of intracranial signals, thereby providing an option which goes beyond the limitations of current clinical instruments.
The study was recently published in the journal Nature.
Physiological data are indicators used to determine the physiological state of the human body, which can help doctors diagnose, treat and detect diseases. Obtaining accurate physiological data concerning the human body in a safe and stable manner has long been a major focus in the medical monitoring field.
The study noted that current wired clinical instruments that use percutaneous leads are susceptible to causing infection and potential surgical complications, while patient mobility is also affected.
Wireless implantable devices offer greater operational freedom but were previously subject to problems such as limited detection range, poor degradation and difficulty in terms of size reduction in the human body.
The research team, led by Prof. Zang Jianfeng from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, developed an injectable, bioresorbable and wireless metastructured hydrogel sensor for ultrasonic monitoring of intracranial signals.
According to the study, the sensors are cubes that are eight cubic millimeters in size, and they are made from biodegradable and stimulus-responsive hydrogels and periodically aligned air columns with a specific acoustic reflection spectrum.
Implanted into intracranial space with a puncture needle, the devices can deform in response to physiological environmental changes, resulting in peak frequency shifts of reflected ultrasound waves that can be wirelessly measured by an external ultrasound probe.
Various categories of physiological data such as intracranial pressure, temperature, pH levels and blood flow velocity can therefore be obtained.
Notably, the invention is made of biodegradable polymer materials, which will degrade in the body after about one month, without having to be removed, reducing both pain and the risk of infection.
In addition, the research team has put forward an innovative algorithm that can efficiently separate the coupling effects of pressure, temperature, pH levels and other factors by simultaneously analyzing the frequency change data of multiple sensors, so as to achieve comprehensive perception of complex physiological environments.
The research team noted that these devices provide huge advantages in reducing energy consumption and having no thermal effect. In the future, they can also be applied to other parts of the human body, promising to deliver a new technology pattern for clinical intelligent diagnosis and treatment.

It has an approximate length of 92.5 meters, a lift-off weight of some 2,189 tonnes, a lift-off thrust of about 2,678 tonnes, and a payload capacity for travel to an Earth-moon transfer orbit of no less than 27 tonnes.
Another rocket, a derivative of the Long-March-10 carrier rocket, does not have boosters and is capable of sending astronauts and cargo to China's space station, according to its developer, which operates under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
The non-booster rocket has a length of about 67 meters, a lift-off weight near 740 tonnes, a lift-off thrust of approximately 892 tonnes, and a payload capacity for transfer to a near-Earth orbit of no less than 14 tonnes.
During Friday's test, the propulsion system's engine started normally, operated stably and shut down on schedule, and all parameters tested were normal, CALVT said.
The propulsion system test is the most complicated and difficult ground test undertaken during the development of carrier rockets.
Friday's test was the largest propulsion system test that has been carried out to date in China's launch vehicle development, with three YF-100K engines ignited simultaneously and ground thrust reaching 382 tonnes.
Its completion means the Long March-10 carrier rocket has entered the fast track in its large-scale ground testing and development, CALVT said.
According to a subsequent development plan, the second first-stage propulsion system test for the Long March-10 carrier rocket will be carried out soon to verify other operating conditions.
