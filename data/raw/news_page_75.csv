Country aims to shine in space-based solar power tech to boost clean energy,2023-12-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1206/c90000-20106383.html,"Home>>
		
Country aims to shine in space-based solar power tech to boost clean energy

Amid global efforts to replace fossil fuels with clean energy, Chinese scientists and engineers are working on a bright idea — soaking up abundant energy from the sun and then beaming it back to Earth.
Multiple teams in China are currently focused on technologies needed for building and running a space-based solar power facility, which will allow the sun's energy to be captured nonstop, something that isn't possible from Earth, said Hou Xinbin, a senior researcher at the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing and a member of the Committee of Space Solar Power of the Chinese Society of Astronautics.
After collecting solar energy, the space facility will convert it into electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, and laser beams and send it wirelessly back to the Earth's surface. Receiving stations will then turn these electromagnetic waves and laser beams into electricity for distribution to power grids, according to Hou, who is also a member at the Permanent Committee on Space Solar Power of the International Academy of Astronautics.
""My colleagues at several domestic institutes and I have proposed a technology demonstration mission to the country's space community, and are hoping it will happen in the near future,"" Hou told China Daily in an exclusive interview last month in Beijing, on the sidelines of an international space industry forum.
""As a key step to verifying the feasibility of space-based solar power generation, we want to make and place into orbit a pair of satellites — a large one that will collect solar power and convert it to microwaves and laser beams, and a smaller one responsible for receiving laser beams. Meanwhile, a ground station will be in charge of receiving the microwaves. The two satellites will form an in-orbit testing system for wireless power transfer,"" he said.
According to the scientist, it is quite difficult to beam laser power to Earth, but it is easier to realize the task between satellites in orbit or between a satellite and a celestial body because of the vacuum.
""Realizing laser power transmissions is meaningful in terms of space programs. For instance, a solar power satellite with laser transmission capability can operate in a lunar polar orbit and provide power supply to exploration programs in polar regions on the moon,"" he said.
However, a host of technical issues must be solved before any commercially viable solar power project can take shape in space, Hou said.
The challenges include developing high-performance components with acceptable sizes and weights — these cannot be too big or too heavy — and integrating them into a satellite, and also ensuring that the power beams reach ground receiving stations with great accuracy, he said.
""In the long term, we need to figure out how to transport large, heavy parts to orbit and then assemble a colossal power station,"" he added.
Hou noted that there is an urgent need in China to develop new sources of clean energy, which are sustainable, affordable and secure, and can be widely used, as China has announced that it aims to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and realize carbon neutrality before 2060.
Pang Zhihao, an expert on space exploration technology and a renowned spaceflight writer, said that space-based solar power stations are a very attractive solution to energy shortages and pollution.
A space-based facility will be able to harness sunlight around the clock without being affected by factors such as the atmosphere and weather, potentially yielding eight times more power than solar panels at most locations on Earth, said Pang, who worked at the China Academy of Space Technology for decades.
In addition, the power generated in this manner will be free of pollution and limitless, he said, adding that this source of energy could also be used to power any spacecraft within its beaming range.
First proposed in 1968 by Peter Glaser, a Czech-American scientist and aerospace engineer, the concept of an orbital solar power plant has been a popular aspiration among spacefaring parties such as the United States, the European Space Agency and Japan, but technological and financial hurdles limited its development until recent years.
In May 2020, the US Naval Research Laboratory conducted its first test of solar power generation in a spacecraft.
In January 2023, the California Institute of Technology launched an experimental satellite called the Space Solar Power Demonstrator, which has successfully beamed detectable power to Earth.

Australian, Chinese researchers make breakthrough with superior surgical implants
 (Xinhua) 14:01, December 05, 2023
CANBERRA, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian and Chinese researchers have made a breakthrough in delivering superior knee and hip replacements.
In a study published on Tuesday, researchers from Flinders University in South Australia and the Shandong First Medical University revealed that their new orthopedic implant technology has a stronger ability to ward off infection and stimulate bone growth post-surgery.
The technology consists of Silver-Gallium (Ag-Ga) nano-amalgamated particles that are applied to the surface of medical devices where it ensures the slow release of silver and gallium ions.
During animal testing, the technology exhibited strong antimicrobial properties against bacterial strains, the study said.
Krasimir Vasilev, senior author of the study and director of the Biomedical Nanoengineering Laboratory at the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University, said in a media release that the breakthrough could address an urgent need to reduce implant-associated infections.
""The new material could be easily and controllably applied by spray-casting on many medical devices to protect them against infection, and also provide anti-inflammatory effect and stimulate bone growth,"" he said.
""Our latest testing indicates this combination of antibacterial protection and tissue integration properties can benefit many devices in the orthopedic, trauma, and also dental areas.""
According to the researchers, infection rates after orthopedic surgery range between 2 and 10 percent in developed countries and up to 15 percent in the developing world.
In addition to implantable devices, Vi-Khanh Truong from the Biomedical Nanoengineering Laboratory at Flinders University said the technology could also be applied to catheters and wound dressings.

Interview: ITER director-general values China's contribution, support to nuclear fusion research
 (Xinhua) 13:52, December 05, 2023
ST PAUL-LEZ-DURANCE, France, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- China has contributed significantly to the international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject ITER, reflecting the big progress in China's national fusion program, said ITER Director-General Pietro Barabaschi.
""I'm really very impressed. When I worked in ITER in the 1990s, China was not part of the project. I gained a lot of experience more recently and I also witnessed in my recent trip to China the level of development in fusion research in general,"" said Barabaschi in a recent interview with Xinhua.
ITER, or International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, aims at creating energy through a fusion process similar to that of the Sun. Built in southern France by seven ITER members -- China, the EU, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States, the facilities will be the world's largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment device and the largest experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor.
China officially joined the ITER program in 2006 as its seventh member. According to the agreement, China is responsible for about 9 percent of the project's construction and operation.
Till now, ""we have a long list of key components delivered by China. They are very important components in different parts of the project, from the power conversion, the magnet system to the feeders and so on,"" Barabaschi told Xinhua.
""China has a very strong contingent here, the largest presence among the non-Europeans, and very highly skilled personnel, said the director-general, adding that he appreciates ""the Chinese on-site work on key activities, mainly the assembly.""
In September 2019, a team led by China Nuclear Power Engineering was awarded the tokamak assembly contract 1 for the assembly of the cryostat and cryostat thermal shield; magnet feeders; the central solenoid, poloidal field and correction coil magnets; and cooling structures and instrumentation.
In May 2020, the 1,250-ton soup bowl-shaped cryostat base, the heaviest single piece of the ITER, was positioned with very high precision into the tokamak pit, marking the official start of the main equipment installation of the world's largest artificial sun.
""There is a strong interest from Chinese companies to participate in the assembly,"" noted Barabaschi. ""It is important for ITER, fusion, and China because these companies acquire a level of competence and know-how, which only ITER can provide.""
While working together with international programs, China made remarkable breakthroughs in its national program.
In April this year, the experimental advanced superconducting tokamak, or the Chinese ""artificial sun,"" located at the Institute of Plasma Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Hefei, capital of China's Anhui Province, achieved a steady-state high confinement plasma operation for 403 seconds, a key step toward the development of a fusion reactor.
In August, China's new-generation ""artificial sun"" HL-3 in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, operated in the high-confinement mode under a plasma current of 1 million amperes for the first time. The high-confinement mode in nuclear fusion with magnetic confinement (H mode) is an advanced operating mode that has been chosen as the standard operating mode for ITER.
""We get really a lot in good cooperation with Hefei, with Chengdu and with all the research infrastructure present in China,"" said the ITER director-general.
""China is doing something remarkable. The very strong commitment from the Chinese government is evident. I trust China will continue to support ITER, this is the message I always get,"" he added.
Leading the crucial project designed to advance fusion science and prepare the way for the fusion power plants of tomorrow, Barabaschi stressed that ITER ""has a value beyond the scientific part.""
""It's quite remarkable that we can continue to work together among the seven members in full harmony, particularly at this point of time with so many difficulties in the geopolitics,"" he said.
The ongoing assembly work is a joint work, and ""when we now move more and more in the assembly phase, we are looking more and more to milestones which are reasons for everybody to celebrate,"" he concluded.

Chinese astronauts kindle youth dream of space exploration
 (Xinhua) 09:57, December 05, 2023
HONG KONG, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of China's manned space program has concluded a six-day visit to Hong Kong and Macao, during which the Chinese astronauts inspired local young people to pursue a dream of space exploration in the interactions.
The delegation came to the two Special Administrative Regions (SARs) in southern China at the invitation of the SAR governments, 11 years after the last such visit.
During their stay from Nov. 28 to Dec. 3, the delegation visited a number of primary and secondary schools and two universities in Hong Kong, and held a special lecture in Macao, meeting with thousands of students in the two cities.
""The Chinese space station is like a home for the motherland in space,"" Shenzhou-14 astronaut Chen Dong said, who expects to see representatives from Hong Kong and Macao at the space station to make China's home in space more lively and happy.
Hong Kong middle school student Shum Tze-man was a bit carried away by the presence of the astronauts at a variety show held on Nov. 29. In her eyes, ""patriotism"" is the word to best characterize the space heroes.
""The motherland's space industry has grown from scratch and now become world leading. I'm proud of our nation and this makes me more obsessed with the starry sky,"" Shum said.
In 1992, China's manned space program was formally established and began to be implemented. In 2022, construction of the Chinese space station was fully completed.
John Lee, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said the delegation told the story of the development of China's manned space program, which made Hong Kong people to feel proud of the country's extraordinary achievements in aerospace technology.
""The reports of space experts involved a lot of professional knowledge in physics and astronomy, some of which were beyond my current learning scope, but it made me more eager to explore the universe,"" a student surnamed Li from Lingnan Middle School in Macao said.
""I am sure our young students treasured this opportunity a lot,"" Ho Iat Seng, chief executive of the Macao SAR, said the delegation's visit demonstrated the country's support for the science and technology education of young students in Macao, which is of great significance.
Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency, who led the delegation of China's manned space program, said that all sectors in Hong Kong and Macao have actively participated in the recruitment of the payload specialists as part of the country's fourth batch of reserve astronauts, as well as in the solicitation of scientific and application projects for the space station.
Lin expressed the hope that astronauts from Hong Kong and Macao will soon be seen stationed in the space station of the motherland, and the payloads designed by the science and education sectors of Hong Kong and Macao carry out experiments in the space station.

Tech reunites missing boy with family after 25 years,2023-12-05,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1205/c90000-20105972.html,"Home>>
		
Tech reunites missing boy with family after 25 years
By Yang Zekun (China Daily) 08:52, December 05, 2023
It took 25 long years, but on Friday, 52-year-old Xie Kefeng was finally reunited with his son, who had been snatched from his parents as an infant. The power of technology, specifically a facial comparison algorithm that takes age-related changes and family similarities into account, played a major role in bringing about the happy outcome.
In 1998, Xie and his wife lived in Xingtai, Hebei province, where they ran a small business. A few days before the Spring Festival that year, Xie's wife stepped out of home to buy groceries, leaving their three-month-old second son, Xie Qingshuai, on the bed with the door unlocked. When she returned a mere 10 minutes later, the child had disappeared.
The couple reported the incident to the police and mobilized relatives and friends for a search that extended to Beijing, Tianjin and Henan province, and then to other provinces and cities, but the child could not be found.
As there were no photographs of the baby, artists' impressions were used on the notices announcing the abduction. Xie Kefeng kept up his own search, spending almost all his savings in the process.
Though they tried to move on with their lives, the abduction hit the couple hard. The boy's mother slipped into depression, and remained on medication for almost 10 years. All the while the couple kept working and searching, hoping to provide their son with a better life if and when he returned. ""I always believed that he was still alive and I will eventually find him,"" said Xie Kefeng.
In late November this year, Xie Kefeng received a call from the police informing him that a facial comparison had led to Xie Qingshuai being found. A DNA comparison confirmed that it was indeed his long-lost son.
Two people had been involved in the abduction. One was dead, the other was taken into custody by the police. An intermediary who sold the baby was also apprehended.
Xie Qingshuai, who now works in Chengdu, Sichuan province, was reunited with his father, mother and older brother on Friday, and met his two sisters for the first-time. Unknown to his family, he had been sold to a couple who lived in Handan, another city in Hebei. After the man he knew as his father died, his wife remarried and moved away, leaving Xie Qingshuai to be brought up by his ""adoptive ""grandparents.
On Sunday, Beijing DeepGlint Technology Co, an artificial intelligence technology company, announced on its official Sina Weibo social media account that a facial comparison algorithm developed by it had played a vital role in the reunion.
In an accompanying video, the company explained that most abducted children are separated from their families at a young age, and their appearances undergo significant changes as time passes, posing a challenge to police investigations.
Based on the principle that facial features among relatives tend to be similar, the company's algorithm can identify highly relevant potential matches, significantly improving the efficiency of the search process.
The company said it used photos of both parents and the boy's older brother to help the facial comparison algorithm narrow the search down to five possibilities.
It said that Xie Qingshuai was the fourth abducted person it had helped the police locate in the past six months.
Shen Junliang, a father who was reunited with his abducted son in 2020 after 15 years of searching, said on Weibo on Saturday that facial recognition technology was of great assistance in the search for missing children — offering hope to many families.
The Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau said it wants to promote the use of technologies, including facial recognition technology, to combat child trafficking and help reunite abducted children with their biological parents.
In 2009, the ministry established a national DNA database to combat child abduction and trafficking. In May 2016, it established the Emergency Information Release Platform for Missing Children, known as the ""Reunion System"".
With a focus on the location where the child went missing, the system can disseminate related missing information to the public within a specific geographical range via 25 mobile applications and various new media channels.
By July last year, the ministry had established 5,000 free blood collection points nationwide, aiming to facilitate timely blood collection for families needing a DNA match.

MACAO, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- ""One, two, three!"" An email was sent into space at the Macao Science Center on Sunday, witnessed by nearly 200 local students.
The email was sent by Wang Yaping, a crew member for China's Shenzhou-13 space mission and the first woman astronaut who has entered China's space station, together with Wong Ging Pui, a senior high school student from Tong Nam Middle School in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) who attended Wang's space class online two years ago.
""Can astronauts surf on the internet and play video games? Can you watch TV? Can we send emails to you while you are in space?"" These were the questions Wong had the chance to ask Wang in December 2021 on behalf of Macao students when she was broadcasting a live lecture in space to students on Earth.
Now Wong was excited to meet Wang in person and experience how to send an email into space using the Beidou Navigation Satellite System.
""I made it!"" said Wong. He said Wang has inspired him by her own stories and personally encouraged him to keep studying hard.
""I hope to become a person like her whose life is meaningful to both the society and the country,"" he said.
Known for being a ""space teacher,"" Wang said she was very happy to be able to interact with the students face to face.
""I'm very glad to see how they have grown,"" she said, encouraging the young people to explore the unknown and break limits on the way to realizing their dreams.
Wang is a member of a delegation of China's manned space program on a six-day visit through Sunday to Hong Kong and Macao SARs at the invitation of the SAR governments.
While at the Macao Science Center, the delegation was briefed on popular science education plans for Macao students. The astronauts gave their thumbs up when learning that junior high school students in Macao have lessons on human exploration of the universe and China's space technology development.

Study sheds new light on mammalian middle ear evolution,2023-12-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1204/c90000-20105666.html,"Home>>
		
Study sheds new light on mammalian middle ear evolution
 (Xinhua) 15:12, December 04, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- A new study shows that the middle ear structure of modern mammals began to evolve as early as the Cretaceous period.
The mammalian middle ear is a classic example of progressive evolution. The middle ear of modern mammals has three auditory ossicles including malleus, incus and stapes, whereas in reptiles there is only one cylindrical bone.
Paleontologists believe that the two small auditory bones in the middle ear of mammals, the incus and the malleus, evolved from the quadrate bone and the mandibular joint bone of reptiles.
Since delicate auditory ossicles are difficult to preserve as fossils, the direct fossil evidence of middle ear evolution is very limited among mammal ancestors closely related to human evolution.
Researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered an eutherian fossil, dating back about 120 million years, in northeast China's Liaoning Province. This fossil represents a ""small mouse"" with a body length of about 12 centimeters.
After restoration, analysis and research, the scientists concluded that the fossil was a new species of early eutherian, and found that its middle ear bone morphology included the external tympanic bone, the malleus bone, the incus bone and the stapes. They named it Microtherulum oneirodes.
""The specific name, oneirodes, pays tribute to the dreamlike nature of this fossil's discovery, which fills a critical gap in our understanding of the middle ear evolution in mammals,"" said Wang Haibing, one of the researchers from the IVPP.
The middle ear of modern mammals is usually divided into six functional morphologies, and the Microtherulum oneirodes' is most closely related to the Microtype ear of modern mammals.
Modern mammals with Microtype ears are adapted to high-frequency hearing, which means early eutherians probably had more sensitive hearing than other mammals of the same period, particularly in terms of high-frequency auditory sensitivity.
The study was recently published in the journal Nature Communications.

NAIROBI, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Early in the morning, Kenya's largest referral hospital, Kenyatta National Hospital, nestled on the northern edge of the capital, Nairobi, bustles with individuals seeking advanced medical care.
This extensive health facility boasts a well-guarded sub-station equipped with automated gadgets manufactured in China to ensure stable electricity supply.
Peter Onyango, head of the hospital's electrical section, highlighted the significance of Sifang's Ring Main Unit (RMU) sourced from Beijing Sifang Automation Company. He said that the installation of Sifang's RMU has effectively eliminated power supply disruptions, notably enhancing the quality of care for patients with critical medical conditions.
Previously reliant on outdated and unreliable oil-operated equipment to manage electricity supply, the hospital faced potential risks to patients in intensive care wards during power outages.
""With Sifang's equipment, we can now remotely detect faults and promptly restore power, mitigating risks to patients in critical care wards,"" Onyango said.
The installation of RMUs has brought relief from power supply interruptions not only to Kenyatta National Hospital but also to numerous public and private facilities in Nairobi and neighboring districts.
Thw access to automated equipment has been made possible through the implementation of a World Bank-funded Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) by Kenya Power, the state-owned power utility.
Francis Maina, the project manager overseeing ADMS at Kenya Power, said that through a competitive bidding process, the Chinese company secured the tender to install RMUs, ensuring stabilized electricity supply at the country's primary referral hospital.
The partnership with Beijing Sifang has significantly contributed to the utility's digitization efforts, enhancing grid reliability while cutting down on fuel and maintenance costs for clients, Maina added.
Notably, at the upscale Panari Hotel, a mid-sized RMU supplied by Sifang has successfully maintained uninterrupted power distribution since its installation in 2022, effectively managing faults along transmission lines.
Outside the hotel, the company's load break switch, positioned atop a concrete pole, regulates electrical current flow in an area primarily occupied by high-end office blocks.
Suleiman Yusuf, the project supervisor at Beijing Sifang, stressed the stability achieved in power supply at client premises, attributing it to the company's flagship equipment, including RMUs, load break switches and autoreclosures.
Moreover, it established a laboratory at the Institute of Energy Studies and Research affiliated with Kenya Power in December 2020, aiming to impart knowledge to local technicians on the application of smart power distribution equipment.
Patrick Karimi, the institute's deputy director in charge of training and research, praised the significant reduction in workload for the operations and maintenance team at the power utility, as well as the quick response to outages ensured by Sifang's smart gadgets.
Kenya has grappled with frequent outages attributed to various factors such as an aging transmission network, staffing challenges at the state-owned power utility, extreme weather events, vandalism and wildlife interference with transmission lines.
Recent reports in local media indicated five nationwide and prolonged blackouts within the past three years. A nationwide power outage lasting over 20 hours in August sparked public outcry due to substantial economic losses.

Major news agencies focus on ethical use of new tech
By Qiu Quanlin (Chinadaily.com.cn) 09:00, December 04, 2023

Participants of the 5th World Media Summit visit on Saturday the GAC Technology Museum, which also houses the product exhibition center of the Guangzhou Automobile Group Co, in Guangzhou, Guangdong province. XINHUA
International news organizations have been urged to collaborate to develop standards around the use of new technologies, including general artificial intelligence, as they bring both risks and opportunities in a rapidly changing environment, according to stakeholders at a world news summit.
""It's very essential that news organizations collaborate to push for a framework that ensures intellectual property is protected,"" said Daisy Veerasingham, president and CEO of The Associated Press, while extending her wishes virtually to the opening of the 5th World Media Summit.
The opening ceremony of the summit, which is themed ""Boosting Global Confidence, Promoting Media Development"", was held on Sunday in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province.
The summit, which runs from Saturday to Friday in the cities of Guangzhou and Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, has gathered over 450 participants from 101 countries and regions, including representatives of 197 mainstream media outlets, think tanks, government agencies and diplomatic missions to China, and agencies of the United Nations and international organizations.
""Gatherings of the kind benefit all news organizations, so that we can work together to advance the power of factual journalism,"" Veerasingham said.
Echoing Veerasingham's remarks, Fabrice Fries, chairman and CEO of Agence France-Presse, said in a congratulatory video message that global media cooperation is crucial as media organizations look to innovate and grow in the face of many technological challenges.
Iqbal Surve, chairman of South Africa's Independent Media, envisioned the summit as a platform for practical cooperation agreements to materialize.
""The summit comes at an opportune time and I hope that media organizations will conclude the summit with tangible cooperation to share resources, technology and information,"" said Surve, while attending the summit.
Fu Hua, executive chairman of the summit and president of Xinhua News Agency, said that establishing a high-level dialogue and cooperation mechanism of leading international wire services within the framework of the summit will help promote mutual development.
""The global media industry is undergoing a significant transformation,"" Fu said, citing factors such as technological innovation that is reshaping the industry and the dissemination of fake news that is challenging journalistic ethics.
Fu made the remarks on Friday during a meeting with leaders of major international wire services, whose news products reach three-fourths of the global population, to discuss cooperation on tackling tough challenges facing media.
The meeting among leaders of Xinhua, Reuters, AP and AFP, which was held in Beijing, was the first of its kind.
Artificial intelligence and technologies such as the metaverse have had disruptive impact on news production, said Reuters Head of Agency Sue Brooks, while addressing the opening of the world summit on Sunday.
""In the near future, the way we create news may change completely, as well as how people consume news and the relationship between news brands and audiences,"" Brooks said.
Brooks said she believes that media in general should adapt to these changes as traditional media has been weakened by social media in the past decade.
""Boosting global confidence is indeed a task. We need to establish trust, and we believe that traditional news brands can continue to report facts at all costs,"" she added.
A consensus was also reached on Sunday, with attending representatives agreeing that global media should actively innovate while adhering to journalistic ethics and professional standards in the face of the rapid development of new technologies in the information age.
Global media organizations should use emerging technologies reasonably to disseminate real, objective, comprehensive and impartial news to audiences, resist fake news, oppose rumors and biases, and uphold media authority and credibility, according to the consensus.
