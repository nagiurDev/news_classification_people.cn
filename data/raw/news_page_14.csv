Scientific surveys valuable in safeguarding ecology on ""roof of the world""
 (Xinhua) 08:07, August 19, 2024
LHASA, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- China's ongoing second scientific expedition and research project on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau has produced a series of high-standard original findings, providing scientific support for the ecological security of the plateau, according to the expedition's top researcher.
To date, the scientific research has yielded significant progress, including results of studies on the changes and impacts of the plateau's water and glacier resources, carbon sink functions and potential, ecosystems, and biodiversity changes, said Yao Tandong, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the leader of the scientific expedition, at a press conference held in Lhasa on Sunday.
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, known as the ""roof of the world"" and Asia's ""water tower,"" is China's most crucial ecological security barrier and a strategic resource reserve, playing a vital role in water, ecological, climate and environmental security globally.
Since the scientific expedition was launched in August 2017, teams comprising more than 7,000 researchers have continuously conducted comprehensive surveys across 19 key areas.

CHANGES IN WATER RESOURCES
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is becoming warmer, wetter and greener, according to Yao.
""The glaciers and snow cover on the plateau are decreasing, while the vegetation is greening,"" he said. ""Such changes could lead to significant shifts in the Asian monsoon circulation, potentially increasing the frequency of extreme weather events in China.""
In recent years, the warming climate and increased humidity have led to significant imbalances on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, which have primarily manifested in the rapid reduction of solid water bodies such as glaciers and snow, alongside a widespread increase in liquid water bodies like lakes and rivers, resulting in a solid-liquid phase imbalance, Yao explained.
This scientific expedition and research project has revealed that the current total surface water storage of Asia's ""water tower"" exceeds 10 trillion cubic meters -- roughly equivalent to the total runoff of the Yellow River over 200 years.
Climate models predict that by the end of the 21st century, some regions could lose more than half of their glacier mass, with lake water levels potentially rising by over 10 meters, according to the conference.
While this phenomenon could enhance the overall water supply capacity, the risks of glacier collapses and glacial lake outburst floods are projected to be more than three times higher than current levels.
Yao also emphasized that the future water resources downstream of Asia's ""water tower"" require regionally differentiated strategies and comprehensive international coordination. ""It is essential to strengthen the construction of early warning systems for glacial collapses and glacial lake outbursts, and to implement more effective measures for sustainable water resource management.""

ECOSYSTEM, BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT
The expedition team has established a classification system for the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem based on the integration of remote-sensing technology and ground surveys, contributing greatly to the analysis of changes in the ecosystem and biodiversity of the plateau.
Researchers have completed a 1:500,000 grassland vegetation map, a 1:500,000 soil map of the plateau, and a distribution map of the alpine tree line spanning 2,400 kilometers across the Himalayas.
""These maps reveal the spatial pattern and dynamic changes of the ecosystem, and improve our assessment of ecosystem quality and its service functions,"" said Ouyang Zhiyun, a researcher at the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences under CAS.
The maps also support the formulation of biodiversity conservation strategies and the overall layout planning for national parks on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau.
The expedition team has also conducted extensive field investigations in vulnerable and critical areas on the plateau, leading to a series of new discoveries in biodiversity. It has published its findings of over 3,000 new species, including 205 new animal species, 388 new plant species and 2,593 new microbial species.
The local government in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region has designated over 600,000 square kilometers of its land as ecological conservation red lines, accounting for more than 50 percent of the region's total land area.
Xizang has 47 nature reserves of various types and levels, covering a total area of 412,200 square kilometers. Its area of ecologically functional land, including forests, grasslands, wetlands and water bodies, has increased to 1.08 million square kilometers.

CARBON SINK FUNCTION
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem absorbs approximately 120 to 140 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, accounting for 10 to 16 percent of China's total ecosystem carbon sink, according to findings released at the conference.
Given that the plateau currently emits 55 million tonnes of CO2 annually, its carbon surplus exceeds 65 million tonnes per year, Yao said.
Yao noted that the plateau's 1.4 million square kilometers of permafrost holds around 37 billion tonnes of organic carbon, accounting for over 60 percent of the plateau's total soil carbon stock.
""However, the potential thawing of deep permafrost due to future climate warming could pose a risk to its carbon sequestration capacity,"" he said.
The Global Observation-based System for Monitoring Greenhouse Gas (GONGGA) system, developed independently by the scientific research survey team, is an essential tool for estimating natural carbon sinks.
It integrates atmospheric transport modeling, CO2 concentration observations and CO2 emission inventories to accurately assess the carbon sink capacity of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem.
This system not only supports China's ""dual carbon"" goals with important scientific data, but also provides valuable Chinese data and methodologies for international carbon accounting and assessment.
""Going forward, the carbon sink function of the plateau can be enhanced by improving the quality of grassland and forest ecosystems,"" Yao said.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
From early June this year, a joint scientific expedition team consisting of researchers from the CAS Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research (ITP), along with scientists and drilling experts from Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, has conducted scientific investigations at Namtso Lake.
The team will carry out long core drilling in the lake to provide new scientific evidence for the study of climate and environmental changes on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau over the past million years.
According to Zhu Liping, leader of the joint scientific expedition team and a researcher at ITP, the drilling of the lake sediment core in Namtso Lake is the highest-altitude drilling project under the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program.
Rolf Kipfer, a professor of environmental physics and aquatic science from Switzerland, is focusing on studying the formation of sediments and their relationship to the lake during this scientific expedition.
""I will analyze the physical structure of the lake and its water quality,"" Kipfer said, adding that this cooperation is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
In 2009, Yao teamed up with Lonnie Thompson, a foreign academician at CAS, and Volker Mosbrugger, an academician at the German National Academy of Sciences, to launch the Third Pole Environment International Program.
With the aim of strengthening collaboration with international organizations, this initiative has helped enhance the international impact of the second Qinghai-Xizang Plateau scientific expedition and research project, and propel related research to the forefront of global scientific endeavors.

Shanghai to develop full-coverage communications network for low-altitude flights
 (Xinhua) 15:50, August 17, 2024
SHANGHAI, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 2026, Shanghai will have largely established a low-altitude communications network with continuous coverage throughout the region, facilitating the development of the low-altitude economy, a government guideline has said.
According to the guideline released by the Shanghai Communications Administration on Friday, the city will, over a period of three years, gradually achieve low-altitude coverage of an internet of intelligence based on 5G-A network -- an enhanced version of 5G.
Shanghai encourages telecommunications companies to provide a communications network with ultra-high bandwidth, ultra-low latency and massive connections for low-altitude flights, the guideline stated.
Moreover, Shanghai aims to promote innovative application of the low-altitude economy, including achieving scaled application of the low-altitude economy in aviation emergency rescue and logistics distribution by 2026. The city will establish regular low-altitude routes for purposes such as logistics distribution.
In terms of industries, Shanghai will expand emergency rescue applications like aviation firefighting, aviation rescue, public health and emergency telecommunications.
Focus will also be placed on aviation logistics distribution, low-altitude government affairs and urban governance, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL), urban air transportation applications, including business travel, air shuttles and private charters, aside from traditional applications such as geological exploration, agriculture and forestry protection, and aerial photography and surveying.

Chinese enterprises fight AI hackers with robotic guardians
 (Xinhua) 15:06, August 17, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- As the Chinese adage goes: ""apply the same tactics to the person who used them on you."" At a time when artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly looms behind cyberattacks, Chinese enterprises have started to employ generative AI technologies to build up defense against such AI threats.
Qi-Anxin Group, a leading Chinese cybersecurity company, released its large-scale model QAX-GPT in March, expecting it to assist in the development of security products, detection of threats and areas of vulnerability, and analysis of internet-related crimes.
This model boasts investigation and judgment abilities close to that of an intermediate-level security expert, while its efficiency in terms of alarms and judgments is more than 60 times that of manual efforts, said Qi Xiangdong, chairman of Qi-Anxin.
Since ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, took the world by storm in late 2022, tech giants and startups worldwide have been rushing to join the AI race by launching similar AI chatbots, as well as industrial applications based on large language models.
Experts believe that generative AI tools lower the barrier to entry for threat actors with limited programming abilities or technical skills and warn that hackers have started using generative AI tools to create malware, dark web and other tools to carry out cyberattacks.
Such AI tools, however, are a double-edged sword for network security. There are also cases where generative AI tools have been fashioned into a weapon to counter cyberattacks.
A lack of network security personnel and resources, leading to alarms being neglected or mishandled, is the biggest vulnerability facing network security, according to a survey by Qi-Anxin.
""To avoid affecting operations, 99 percent of alarms suggesting cybersecurity threats require expert analysis. However, the number of experts in any company is limited compared to the tremendous number of alarm instances. The comprehensive analysis system empowered by AI will therefore greatly boost security defense,"" said Qi.
Compared with a human expert, QAX-GPT learns much faster, gaining its expertise from a corpus of analysis, reports and articles related to cybersecurity, said Zhang Zhuo, vice president of Qi-Anxin.
""Challenges facing cybersecurity are scarcity of experts, human alarm fatigue and efficiency bottlenecks. The large-scale model enables us to transform from reproducing goods to reproducing expert experience,"" said Zhang.
China has been a major victim of hacking and cyberattacks. More than 42 million malware attacks were detected in China in 2020, according to a report released by the cybersecurity watchdog, the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China.

China's commercial space sector takes off amid tech innovation push,2024-08-17,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0817/c90883-20207023.html,"Home>>Foreign Affairs

China's commercial space sector takes off amid tech innovation push
 (Xinhua) 14:10, August 17, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- As China forges ahead with its high-quality development, new quality productive forces are taking the center stage. One of the key players, the commercial space sector, is experiencing rapid growth and making a mark on the global stage.
In December 2023, Beijing Interstellar Glory Space Technology, better known as iSPACE, conducted another successful test of its own reusable launcher, marking a step toward a fully functional, domestically manufactured reusable rocket for China's commercial spaceflight industry.
This private Chinese aerospace company is looking to catch up with the world's most advanced rocket technologies. ""There is still a long way ahead. But we're catching up fast,"" Anna Choi, vice manager of iSPACE, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
In 2019, the Chinese startup successfully launched its SQX-1 Y1 rocket, sending two satellites into a 300-km circular orbit. It was the first time a private Chinese company managed to put a satellite into orbit.
Its test on Dec. 10 last year verified the Hyperbola-2Y as a reusable liquid oxygen and methane carrier rocket -- the first of its kind in the country. It is part of an iSPACE plan to launch a reusable medium-lift rocket into orbit in late 2025.
Since its inception in 2016, the company's staff has expanded from less than 10 to more than 400 people.
Choi said both the company and the industry are growing at a fast pace, propelled by technological innovation and catalyzed by the government's supportive policies.
iSPACE is one of several Chinese enterprises active in the commercial aerospace industry in recent years. The country has experienced an explosion of commercial space companies since 2014, driven by the government's opening up of the sector to private capital.
According to media reports, in 2023 alone, the country's private commercial spaceflight companies managed more than 10 successful launches.
Like iSPACE, most of these enterprises are headquartered in Beijing, attracted by the capital's rich talent pool and supportive policies.
Beijing in February 2024 announced plans to establish a dedicated ""Rocket Street"" as a research and production hub for advancement of the commercial aerospace sector. Construction started last month at the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area (BDA), located in a southeastern suburb of Beijing.
""Through the 'Rocket Street' program, we hope to leverage the cluster advantage to facilitate the development of the sector,"" said a BDA official.
The capital city's endeavor to foster the commercial aerospace sector comes amid the country's efforts to develop new quality productive forces to help advance the world's second-largest economy up the global value chain. Developing commercial spaceflight was listed among the key areas for development in China's government work report this year.
These priorities, which also include bio-manufacturing, the low-attitude economy, quantum technology and life sciences, form part of the country's agenda to pursue sustainable growth through developing strategically important and future-oriented industries.
Reflecting the rising level of government support, Choi said the municipal government provided subsidies for the commercial aerospace industry to set up innovation centers focusing on developing reusable rockets. The government is also striving to encourage more private capital investment in this sector.
Besides Beijing, multiple other regions and cities in China have also announced plans to develop the commercial aerospace industry.
""This is a sector that requires pioneering courage. We are committed to innovation and confident for the catch-up and beyond,"" Choi said.

Chinese scientists establish brain-inspired network model to bridge AI, neuroscience
 (Xinhua) 10:17, August 17, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has established a novel brain-inspired network model based on internal complexity to address challenges faced by traditional models, such as high consumption of computing resources, according to the Institute of Automation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Friday.
One of the key objectives in the current development of the artificial intelligence (AI) is to build more general-purpose AI, enabling models to possess a broader and more general cognitive ability.
The current popular approach used by large models is to build larger, deeper, and wider neural networks based on the law of scale, which can be referred to as a method for achieving general intelligence based on ""external complexity,"" said Li Guoqi, a researcher from the Institute of Automation.
However, this approach faces challenges such as unsustainable consumption of computing resources and energy, as well as a lack of interpretability.
On the other hand, a human brain has about 100 billion neurons and nearly 1,000 trillion synaptic connections, with each neuron having a rich and diverse internal structure. But the power consumption of a human brain is only around 20 watts.
Inspired by the dynamics of brain neurons, the scientists, from the Institute of Automation and other research institutions such as Tsinghua University and Peking University, used an ""internal complexity"" approach to achieve general intelligence.
Their experiments verified the effectiveness and reliability of the internal complexity model in handling complex tasks, providing new methods and theoretical support for integrating the dynamic characteristics of neuroscience into AI, and also offering feasible solutions for optimizing and enhancing the practical performance of AI models.
The study was published recently in the journal Nature Computational Science.

BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- China's commitment to sustainable development has been bolstered by its strong green innovation, as evidenced by a recent report showing a 20 percent year-on-year increase in low-carbon patent applications, outpacing the global average.
Released by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), the patent report underscores China's pivotal role in propelling global green development. It reveals that in 2023, China's green and low-carbon invention patent applications soared to 101,000, accounting for more than half of the world's total.
The patent surge is particularly noticeable in the new-energy vehicle and solid-state battery sectors, which can be attributed to Chinese companies' investments in innovation.
Leading the charge is EV manufacturer NIO, which holds the industry's highest number of invention patents. In 2023, the Chinese company's total revenue reached 55.62 billion yuan (7.78 billion U.S. dollars), but it invested a staggering 13.43 billion yuan in technology research and development. As of June 2024, the decade-old automaker boasted a cumulative 9,000 global patent applications and grants.

Xiaomi, a newcomer to the EV industry, has also secured a significant number of patents. Known for its smart consumer electronics, Xiaomi has placed a strong emphasis on technological advancements. Before the launch of its high-tech sedan in March, the company announced the acquisition of 60 patents in motor electronic control and 65 in battery technology within just two years.
Cost-effectiveness used to be the primary competitive advantage of domestic companies like Xiaomi in market penetration. However, they have now shifted their focus to IP efforts, as they realized that prioritizing innovation is the only way to achieve sustainable development.
Many EV companies have collaborated with universities and research institutions to pursue breakthroughs in critical technologies, such as advanced materials and smart driving systems. Most of their patents are high-value ones, focusing on battery safety, performance optimization and cost control. When entering global markets, these companies established an extensive patent framework covering the entire industry chain, from component design and manufacturing to vehicle integration and intelligence, from charging facilities to service networks.

Besides the IP endeavors of enterprises, the country's IP regulators have also expedited patent review services for green and low-carbon technologies. The CNIPA has issued guidelines that prioritize patent examination for energy conservation and environmental protection applications.
According to Professor Song Hefa of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, prioritizing patent reviews and expediting the grant process provide a significant advantage to small enterprises and start-ups with limited financial resources. These entities can leverage their patent portfolios to attract investment opportunities.
""Shortening the review period enables these businesses to secure patent rights faster, which in turn can draw potential investors and expedite the realization and commercialization of their inventions,"" said Song.
The CNIPA has also offered analyses of global green and low-carbon technology patents annually to help enterprises gauge global innovation trends and chart the direction of their R&D investments.
Its Report on Statistical Analysis of Green and Low-Carbon Patents this year shows a record high year-on-year growth of published applications worldwide since 2017. Energy-storage patents dominated, with a 37.2 percent share and a 19.8 percent growth rate, while carbon capture, utilization and storage lagged at 6.7 percent. Among the clean energy sources, hydrogen energy showed the most rapid growth, emerging as a new innovation focus for many countries.
From 2016 to 2023, China maintained a growth trend in fields such as carbon reduction of fossil energy and energy saving, outperforming other major countries, according to the report.

China has set a national goal of reaching peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. It has been reinforced by a comprehensive approach to green and low-carbon development, which was emphasized in a resolution adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in July.
The green transition is not only a national priority but also an integral part of everyday life. The country's commitment to low-carbon development has fostered a consumer market that values green consumption behaviors.
A 2023 consumption trend report shows that 73.8 percent of Chinese consumers prioritize green and environmentally friendly products or brands, with post-90s consumers showing the highest acceptance of green products.
The low-carbon preference is creating more opportunities for innovators. Household appliance giant Gree has submitted approximately 3,500 patent applications related to energy conservation and emission reduction. It boasts a ""zero carbon source"" air-conditioning patented technology that combines photovoltaic and energy storage systems, which can effectively reduce carbon emissions by almost 86 percent.

Haier, another leading enterprise, has also made significant efforts in energy-saving research. It collaborated with Xi'an Jiaotong University to develop a patented air-conditioning technology that enhances performance while reducing power consumption.
This week, the Chinese authorities have unveiled a guideline aimed at accelerating the green transformation across all facets of economic and social development. A key emphasis of this blueprint is the reinforcement of the creation, protection and utilization of IP in green and low-carbon technologies, invigorating innovation throughout society.
Propelled by both policy support and market demand, China is poised to witness a greater growth in green patents, which will continue to boost its innovative and sustainable development.

LHASA, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- A Science and Technology Backyard (STB) focusing on dairy cows was inaugurated in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region on Thursday, initiating an innovative model for the dairy industry on the plateau.
China Agricultural University has been conducting a scientific assessment of cows and dairy farms at a farming center and a pasture in the regional capital of Lhasa since 2023, in a bid to adjust the feeding management to maximize the production potential of dairy cows.
The Ministry of Education officially approved the establishment of the Xizang Chengguan plateau dairy cow STB at the end of 2023. In March, scholars from China Agricultural University settled in the STB.
""Xizang has a high altitude and harsh climate, so dairy cows have a high incidence of cerebral edema and pulmonary edema, which affects their production performance,"" said Fang Qianhai with the university.
""In this regard, we have developed an early warning system for altitude sickness and innovatively designed a portable wearable oxygen mask for cows,"" Fang said.
The STB is a science and technology service platform established on the front line of production, such as rural areas and enterprises, that integrates agricultural science and technology innovation, demonstration and promotion, and talent training.

"Tech-cultivation makes life, work peachy in east China",2024-08-16,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0816/c90000-20206627.html,"Home>>
		
Tech-cultivation makes life, work peachy in east China
 (Xinhua) 09:40, August 16, 2024
NANJING, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- The application of modern agricultural technology in Yangshan Township, east China's Jiangsu Province, is breathing new life into the centuries-old cultivation traditions of this ""hometown of honey peaches.""
Yangshan Township of Wuxi City is often celebrated as one of China's four major peach-producing areas. Decades of selective breeding and cultivation have yielded over 30 distinct varieties of Yangshan peach, drawing many enthusiasts to head to the source to purchase or pick their own every year.
The peach trees in Sun Jianqin's orchard stand out from those typical in other places. In Sun's orchard, peach trees bred with new technology are three or four meters in height, much taller than normal. In addition, Sun's peach trees feature two large branches, which makes the fruits easy to pick. Normal peach trees have fruits scattered on three to four main branches among denser branches, which makes picking difficult to mechanize.
With a passion for machinery, Sun has tailored his peach farm to accommodate new varieties, streamlining the automation process. For example, the laborious task of climbing ladders to harvest was a significant inconvenience for workers. But on Sun's farm, the space between the rows of trees is larger, reaching 1.5 meters, to allow machines to pass through. Now, workers simply stand on a movable ""elevator platform,"" expediting and simplifying the picking process.
The new cultivation model in his 150-mu (about 10 hectares) orchard has helped boost yield potential by at least 20 percent. It is more cost-effective and efficient than traditional manual labor as well, according to Sun.
Almost every household in Yangshan is involved in peach cultivation, with an increasing number of farmers eager to harness the ""sweetness"" of science and technology.
In 2023, the output value of peaches in Yangshan was about 900 million yuan (about 126 million U.S. dollars), and the output value of the industrial chain of the peach industry exceeded 2 billion yuan. The per capita disposable income of farmers was 66,000 yuan during the period, up 4.9 percent year on year, according to the local government.
""In the past, most peach farmers planted peaches spontaneously on their own land, but they lacked guidance on how to improve the soil and how to dose pesticides and fertilizers. After introduction and training by the local government and institutes, more and more peach farmers are actively trying to adopt new technology to grow peaches,"" said Dai Huijun, a manager of the local agricultural industrial park.
Bolstered by the research institute, a suite of innovative planting technologies has been extensively disseminated, encompassing sensor-aided monitoring of peach tree growth, preemptive pest and disease alert systems, and soil-analytic irrigation protocols.
On the assembly line at Wuxi Taihu Yangshan Peach Tech Co., Ltd., peaches of varying sizes are meticulously arranged, with 3D vision technology facilitating the intelligent sorting of over 180 peaches per minute, categorizing them by attributes such as shape, weight and sweetness.
After sorting and packing, another important step is getting them to the consumers in one piece and on time.
In June, SF Express, a leading Chinese logistics firm, initiated the use of a fleet of novel, energy-efficient drones for direct transportation of peaches from the farms to regional logistics hubs. From these hubs, the peaches embark on journeys via cargo aircraft along long-haul routes, reaching customers in key markets such as Singapore and Dubai. Customers in neighboring provinces in China can receive their peaches within just half-day.
Earlier this year, China unveiled its ""No. 1 central document"" for 2024, outlining the priorities for comprehensively promoting rural revitalization this year. The document calls for efforts to strengthen the role of sci-tech development in promoting rural revitalization.
""With new technology, we can digitize and green the peach industry. Our aspiration is to cultivate superior quality peaches and elevate the prestige of the Yangshan peach brand,"" said Yao Guojin, deputy head of Yangshan Township.

Chinese platform facilitates technological innovation of enterprises
By Yu Weiliang, Fan Haotian (People's Daily) 09:32, August 16, 2024
High-quality development of enterprises relies heavily on technology and talent. In Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei province, a dedicated platform has been established to bridge the gap between enterprises and technological expertise.
In a laboratory of the School of Automation, China University of Geosciences in Wuhan, associate professor Zhang Jingjing was working with Yan Wenlin, head of R&D with Wuhan AI Technology Co., Ltd., to test a newly developed temperature and humidity sensor prototype. Connecting circuit boards to oscilloscopes and multimeters, they examined waveforms, and measured voltage and current.

Just three months ago, Zhang and Yan, whose offices are only two kilometers apart, had never met each other. What brought them together was the Hubei Sci-tech Innovation Supply Chain Platform (hereafter referred to as ""the Platform"").
The Platform was launched in 2023, with companies proposing research topics and universities and research institutes offering responses, creating an industrial innovation ecosystem that is demand-oriented and enterprise-centered.
It provides services for users across the province, such as contract signing and supply-demand matchmaking of technology, human resources, and financing.
Zhang, engaged in computer vision research, had long entertained the idea of empowering agriculture with artificial intelligence, but had not found the proper approach yet.
Wuhan AI Technology Co., Ltd. is a business startup committed to developing affordable sensors that can be used by aquaculture farmers. Before meeting Zhang, Yan had sought technological support from multiple agricultural universities and research institutions, only to be met with disappointment.

Yan attributed it to two reasons. ""First, researchers' focuses don't always align with the needs of companies; second, they don't have enough trust for small enterprises like us.""
Thanks to the Platform, enterprises can now easily find technological support just like they would shop online. ""The intelligent matching model on the Platform enables 'one-click matchmaking,' which can ensure quick and easy connections between supply and demand. Behind every piece of effective information is a technology manager who provides comprehensive services to both enterprises and research institutions. This allows for rapid communication and problem-solving,"" said Li Tianpei, general manager of Hubei Sci-tech Innovation Supply Chain Co., Ltd.
Learning about the Platform, Yan registered on it through a quick QR code scan and posted a request for creating a micro temperature and humidity sensor. Soon, Yan was recommended with multiple eligible technology suppliers.
Finally, Yan selected Zhang's team under the recommendation of a technology manager. In just a week, Zhang devised a detailed development plan for developing the sensor, rapidly completing the prototype design and moving on to the testing phase.
How can sci-tech achievements be turned into commercial products after aligning supply and demand?

Hubei has rolled out new policies to improve the incentive mechanism by taking Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (EDZ) as a pilot, in an effort to boost collaborations on the Platform.
An annual special fund of 200 million yuan ($27.85 million) has been set up to support the phased transformation and commercialization of sci-tech achievements. It also supports collaborative research among enterprises, universities, and research institutions, with the government providing enterprises with one-third of the actual investment. The maximum financial support for a single project is 1 million yuan.
In February this year, Wuhan Ganwei Technology Co., Ltd. posted on the Platform a demand for a highly integrated industrial-grade infrared optical gas sensor. Experts from the Optics Valley Laboratory (Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics) located in EDZ, also known as Optics Valley of China, soon took up the task. ""Initially, our projected budget was 1 million yuan, but the cost proposed by the experts was slightly higher,"" said Zhang Junlong, the company's general manager.
Thanks to a project it joined under the encouragement of EDZ, the company became eligible for a 1-million-yuan incentive fund, which allowed Zhang Junlong to focus on the collaboration with the laboratory.
As of now, the Platform has attracted over 34,000 active companies, which have released more than 16,000 demands. Over 4,500 collaborations have been facilitated.

Chinese eVTOL firm aims to offer affordable flights, in boost for low-altitude economy
By Tao Mingyang (Global Times) 08:35, August 16, 2024
Chinese start-up Autoflight Aviation Technology (Autoflight) said travel by its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft will be an affordable service, aiming to bring the emerging transportation mode closer to most people's lives.
Xie Jia, senior vice president of Autoflight, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the unit price of its eVTOL service between Shenzhen and Zhuhai in South China's Guangdong Province will be reduced to 6 yuan ($0.84) per kilometer per person.
""It is expected that after the commercial operation is scaled up, the cost of a single seat from Shenzhen to Zhuhai via our eVTOL aircraft, a distance of 50 kilometers, will be 300 yuan,"" he said, adding that the journey takes 20 minutes by aircraft compared to about 150 minutes by car.
In the first half of 2024, China's number of newly registered drones surpassed 600,000, up by 48 percent from the level at the end of 2023, official data showed, and over 14,000 enterprises have been granted an operation license for civil unmanned aerial vehicles at present.
Aside from diversifying people's transportation methods, unmanned aerial vehicles are now widely used in delivery services.
China Media Group (CMG) reported on Thursday that drones have been used in delivering university admission letters in Guangzhou this year. Also in April 2024, China-made civil drones commenced cargo delivery services on Mount Qomolangma at an altitude of 6,000 meters, which greatly shortened the previous eight-hour delivery time to 12 minutes.
China's 2024 Government Work Report listed fostering the low-altitude economy as an emerging industry and a new growth engine. The resolution adopted by the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also emphasized developing the low-altitude economy as part of efforts to modernize infrastructure.
China now has over 70,000 low-altitude economy enterprises nationwide, and the market size is expected to reach 2 trillion yuan in 2030, CMG reported.

An exhibition themed on the history of cooperation between the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) and the World Federation of Scientific Workers (WFSW) opened on Tuesday as part of the activities to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the cooperation between the two sides.
The WFSW is the first international organization that CAST joined. In 1964, the Peking Symposium, the first large-scale international academic conference held by China, took place, according to CAST.
Looking back at the history of cooperation between CAST and WFSW, their shared original aspiration and central theme have always been working together for science. Chinese scientists actively participated in the preparation and establishment of WFSW and related activities, promoting scientific and technological cooperation. To facilitate this, China hosted the 1964 Peking Symposium, inviting scholars from around the world to discuss the mission and development of science. Since the start of reform and opening up in 1978, CAST has continued to deepen cooperation with WFSW, committing to international scientific and technological exchanges, advocating trust and cooperation, and contributing to maintaining world peace, addressing global challenges, and promoting the sustainable development of human society, according to a statement from CAST sent to the Global Times.
So far, CAST and other Chinese scientific associations have joined 875 international organizations, and nearly 800 international academic conferences are held in China annually. These achievements and prospects in the field of science and technology demonstrate China's significant progress in opening up to the outside world.
Looking ahead, CAST stated that they are unfolding a new chapter in international scientific cooperation. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the 1964 Peking Symposium, providing an excellent opportunity to review the history of cooperation and create a better future. As part of this commemoration, CAST organized an exhibition themed on the history of cooperation between CAST and WFSW.
China will continue to adhere to a high level of openness to the world. In today's world, cooperation is the only way to achieve win-win results, especially in the field of technology, as science knows no borders, Shi Yigong, deputy president of CAST, said in a speech at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
In 1964, the WFSW and CAST jointly organized the Peking Symposium, successfully breaking through technological barriers and promoting international scientific exchanges. Today, as we gather here, we are not only commemorating this conference but also reflecting on the past and present, and opening up new pathways for our future cooperation and mutual benefit, Shi noted.
Many valuable materials that document the history of China's scientific cooperation with the world are displayed at the exhibition.
For example, the first picture in the first unit of the exhibition, ""The Vision of the World,"" comes from a report in the British journal Nature on the conference “Science and the Welfare of Mankind,” held in February 1946 in London. Related questions concerning the establishment of WFSW were discussed after the conference. Chinese meteorologist Tu Changwang and the late nuclear physicist Qian Sanqiang attended the conference, representing the Chinese science and technology community.

Co-chairman of WFSW, Jean-Paul Lainé, expressed his appreciation for the positive, fruitful, and sincere cooperation between CAST and WFSW over the past 60 years during the exhibition. He emphasized that this collaboration should serve as a model for cooperation between different scientific organizations worldwide.
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, China shared information about the virus with the world soon after the pandemic broke out. This is a typical example of the benefits of cooperation, Lainé told the Global Times.
Lainé emphasized the importance of cooperation and communication in addressing global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. He praised China for sharing information about the virus early on, which he believes is a testament to the benefits of working together.
However, Lainé also raised concerns about the threats facing such cooperation, particularly due to geopolitical tensions.
A report published in Nature in July revealed a decline in research collaborations between China and the US. ""This decline is a really bad signal. Regardless of the political climate, scientific communication should remain unaffected, as the purpose of science is to benefit people rather than governments,"" Lainé stressed.
CAST is the largest scientific organization in China, serving as a home for 120 million Chinese science and technology workers. It represents China in 380 international scientific organizations and maintains long-term cooperation with 136 scientific and engineering institutions in 49 countries, according to the association.

BEIJING, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers, in collaboration with counterparts from France, Germany and Ireland, have discovered that between 650 million and 280 million years ago, the Earth-Moon distance increased by approximately 20,000 km, and the length of a day extended by roughly 2.2 hours, the Science and Technology Daily reported Tuesday.
The Earth's rotation has been slowing over time due to tidal dissipation, but the rate of this deceleration has not been consistently established, according to a relevant research article published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
The researchers analyzed eight geological datasets to reconstruct the Earth's rotational history from 650 million to 240 million years ago. Their findings enabled them to test physical tidal models and identify a staircase pattern in the Earth's deceleration between 650 million and 280 million years ago.
Specifically, there are two periods with high Earth rotation deceleration -- from 650 to 500 million years ago and from 350 to 280 million years ago -- separated by an interval of stalled deceleration from 500 million to 350 million years ago.
These two periods roughly coincided with the Cambrian explosion and the largest mass extinction event in Earth's history, the article noted, adding that the two periods may have provided the necessary conditions for the evolution of early Marine ecosystems.
Modeling indicated that, except for the very recent time, tidal dissipation is the main driver for decelerating Earth's rotation, according to the research article.
The study has important theoretical significance for exploring the climate, environment and biological evolution of the Earth's rotation deceleration, said Ma Chao, a professor at the Chengdu University of Technology.
The team of researchers will further study the internal links between the Earth's rotation changes and natural phenomena such as the Earth's magnetic field, tidal actions and climate change in order to build a more comprehensive and accurate Earth system evolution model, Ma said.

"Feature: China's ""little photographer"" on far side of the moon",2024-08-14,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0814/c90000-20205647.html,"Home>>
		
Feature: China's ""little photographer"" on far side of the moon
 (Xinhua) 11:12, August 14, 2024
BEIJING, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- On the desolate surface of the moon, a shimmering spacecraft with a long robotic arm appears dazzling against the backdrop of the black sky, while the faint line of a rut is visible on the lunar soil.
When the China National Space Administration released this picture after China's Chang'e-6 probe collected the first samples from the far side of the moon in June, it went viral across Chinese social media platforms, arousing people's curiosity as to how the photo was taken. Chinese space engineers recently revealed the ""secret photographer.""
The ""photographer"" is not a person, but an autonomous, intelligent mini robot weighing less than five kilograms that was attached to the lander of the Chang'e-6 during the mission's journey to the moon, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), its developer.
After Chang'e-6 collected its lunar samples, the mini robot autonomously detached from the lander, moved to a suitable position, selected an ideal angle for the photograph, and then captured the image.
As the world's first autonomous intelligent robot to land on the far side of the moon, it is highly capable and has significantly enhanced autonomous intelligence despite its compact size, according to the CASC.
Equipped with artificial intelligence technologies based on neural networks, the robot can think and judge like a human, said Xing Yan, a researcher with the CASC. It can accomplish many tasks that are not possible with traditional methods, such as adjusting the camera angle, she said.
Traditional lunar photography missions require meticulous calculations to determine the relative distance, position and ideal timing for capturing images. However, on the Chang'e-6 mission, the robot did not need exact computations. Instead, it autonomously assessed and refined its approach based on the quality of the images it captured, thereby ensuring the optimal visual outcome.
To accumulate the necessary experience, it requires extensive learning in autonomous intelligence development. The researchers prepared a variety of lights to help the robot learn and adapt to the unique lighting conditions on the far side of the moon, where the light source is singular and the backdrop is the inky expanse of space, said Huang Huang, another researcher of the CASC.
She still remembers her online shopping spree, purchasing a variety of lights such as fishing lamps, camping lamps, stage lights, all in an effort to broaden the mini robot's exposure to diverse lighting conditions.
The researchers developed a feature model of the environment based on the lights. By immersing the robot in this setting, they facilitated its learning process, ultimately achieving intelligent photographic decision-making.
Besides having a clever mind, the mini robot also boasts a robust ""physique"" to cope with the complex environment on the far side of the moon.
In contrast to the moon's near side, which is relatively flat, the far side features a more complex terrain, characterized by more mountains, deep valleys and craters.
Researchers conducted numerous simulation experiments with the mini robot working on special types of terrain.
The research team had to repeatedly adjust the structure and technical details of the mini robot to meet the requirements for the Chang'e-6 mission. At times, the relentless string of setbacks cast doubt on their design principles, Xing said.
""However, no matter how challenging, exhausting or stressful the situation was, we managed to calm ourselves down and address the issues first,"" she said.
Despite its great technological complexity, the mini robot is cost-effective to produce. As the technology matures, the potential applications for the future are diverse.
It can be reconfigured into a variety of forms, such as a floor-sweeping robot, a household assistant, a companion robot and an educational robot. It is also capable of performing inspections in confined spaces like narrow caves or pipelines, Xing said.
As deep-space exploration targets extend further and further away, autonomous intelligence will become a key technology in China's deep-space exploration endeavors, said Li Yong with the CASC.
For many deep-space missions, current telemetry and control technologies fall short of coverage. The uncertainty of the terrain to be explored dictates that many activities must be independently carried out by the probe itself, he said.

Chinese humanoid robots enter factory for on-site training,2024-08-14,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0814/c90000-20205618.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese humanoid robots enter factory for on-site training
By Wang Yunna (People's Daily) 10:05, August 14, 2024
Recently, industrial humanoid robots developed by UBTECH Robotics Corp, a Chinese robot manufacturer based in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong province, were introduced to the assembly workshop of a factory of Chinese electric carmaker NIO in Hefei, east China's Anhui province. They were put to work alongside humans to inspect the quality of automobiles.
Making small steps, a humanoid robot came to the left side of a car and soon completed the quality inspection of the front and rear door locks. Pausing the movement, it extended its arm into the car body, rotated its wrist 180 degrees, and pulled down the seatbelt with its five fingers, completing the safety belt functionality check. The inspection results were uploaded to the factory's intelligent manufacturing management system as the robot performed its functions.

""Humanoid robots are now being used in actual car production settings, moving beyond experimental labs. By collecting data from the assembly line and understanding the company's production needs, they have undergone self-iteration and upgrades for formal deployment,"" said Jiao Jichao, vice president of UBTECH Robotics and executive dean of UBTECH Research Institute.
Industrial robots such as industrial manipulators and welding and painting robots are becoming increasingly common in production workshops. What makes humanoid robots different?
Humanoid robots are more intelligent than traditional industrial robots, which are limited to executing tasks with predetermined processes and often struggle to accomplish complex activities such as flexible assembly.
""Our company specializes in tasks that traditional industrial robots find difficult to accomplish,"" said Jiao.
Actions like walking, stopping, turning, and visual detection may seem simple, but they pose significant technical challenges.
The movements of humanoid robots, much like those of humans, are largely dependent on joints. When UBTECH Robotics teams initially developed humanoid robots, their biggest concern was the search for the right robot joints.
""At that time, we were unable to find them in the Chinese market, and the imported ones didn't meet our requirements,"" Jiao said.
Servo drives, acting as the joint actuators of robots, play a vital role in determining robots' motion capabilities. A high-power servo drive used in humanoid robots consists of 50 to 100 different parts, while a low-power one has 40 to 80 parts.
Thanks to continuous technological breakthroughs, UBTECH Robotics has managed to develop and commercialize a diverse range of servo drives, ranging from compact, low-torque models to powerful, high-torque variants. Over 90 percent of these components are produced independently in China, up from the previous 40 percent.
For instance, harmonic rotary servo drives are characterized by their high torque density, small size, light weight, and fast response, enabling robots to have more agile and stable arms and legs for heavy-duty tasks like carrying and sorting, Jiao explained.
""Leveraging the flexible disassembly of robots, we created modular end effectors such as 'hands' and 'feet.' For example, we designed various types of 'hands' for robots, including human-like five-fingered hands and two-fingered grippers. Using different connection methods, we can easily swap out these end effectors as needed,"" said Jiao.
In addition to the developed and dexterous ""limbs,"" humanoid robots also require an intelligent and adaptable ""brain."" Chinese professionals in big data and artificial intelligence are working to train humanoid robots on how to plan intricate models and improve strategies using algorithms, specifically for industrial manufacturing scenarios.
For example, semantic visual navigation technology is developed to enhance robots' perception of their surroundings and scenes by extracting high-level semantic information and building spatial topological relationships.
""Through semantic navigation, humanoid robots are capable of autonomously scheduling tasks and performing diverse operations in different workshops,"" Jiao said.
Different car makers have different demands for humanoid robots, so on-site training in factories is crucial. ""Carmakers provide verification and testing scenarios for humanoid robots, which allows for data collection, algorithm iteration, and performance improvement,"" said Jiao.
According to him, UBTECH Robotics has collaborated with automakers such as Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor, FAW-Volkswagen Automobile Co., Ltd. Qingdao Branch, and Geely to update and iterate algorithms based on real manufacturing scenarios, thereby further enhancing robot performance.
It is expected that the first batch of humanoid robots will be delivered and put into operation in car manufacturing workshops within this year.
It takes more than 7,000 parts to build a humanoid robot. In recent years, the humanoid robot industry in Guangdong province has seen major achievements, with breakthroughs in key technologies and ongoing improvements in supply chains. As of August 2023, Guangdong was home to 39 humanoid robot companies.
In the first half of 2024, the Department of Industry and Information Technology of Guangdong Province announced an action plan to cultivate future intelligent equipment industry clusters. The plan aims to turn Guangdong into a global innovation hub for future intelligent equipment industries such as humanoid robots, aerospace equipment, deep-sea equipment, and underground equipment by 2035.

New research suggests presence of concealed ocean beneath surface of Mars

WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- An underground reservoir of water may reside beneath the surface of Mars, according to new research released on Monday.
This water, estimated to be located approximately 7 to 12 miles (11.5 to 20 km) below the Martian crust, is hidden within cracks in underground rocks. The volume of water present is substantial enough to potentially form a global ocean on Mars.
The findings are based on seismic measurements from NASA's Mars InSight lander, which used a seismometer to detect Mars' interior between 2018 and 2022.
The water on Mars is believed to have transiently existed on the planet's surface over 3 billion years ago when Mars had rivers, lakes, and oceans, according to planetary scientist Vashan Wright of the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, lead author of the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
However, as Mars' atmosphere thinned, it is thought to have lost its surface water. The new findings suggest that the water has seeped into Mars' crust.
""Understanding the Martian water cycle is critical for understanding the evolution of the climate, surface and interior,"" Wright said.
