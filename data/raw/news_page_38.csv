China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe has successfully entered its circumlunar orbit after performing a near-moon braking procedure on Wednesday, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
The near-moon braking procedure is a key orbital control action for the Chang'e-6 lunar probe during its flight. The probe should begin braking when approaching the moon to maintain a speed lower than the lunar escape velocity so that it could be captured by the moon's gravitational force and realize circumlunar flight.
If the braking is not applied hard enough and the speed is not reduced, the Chang'e-6 lunar probe will slide into outer space. On the other hand, if the braking is too strong, it could collide with the moon, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
The Chang'e-6 lunar probe consists of an orbiter, a returner, a lander and an ascender. The orbiter is equipped with an orbit control engine to control braking and deceleration during gravitational capture.
The development team also pioneered the design of the secondary thermal protection composite system, for the orbiter to wear a ""super protective suit."" Layers of protection keep the important payload machine on the orbiter away from high temperature, creating a comfortable traveling experience for the Chang'e-6, Xinhua reported.
The Chang'e-6 lunar probe will later adjust the altitude and inclination of its circumlunar orbit with the support of the Queqiao-2 relay satellite, and implement the separation of the orbiter and returner combination from the lander and ascender combination at an opportune time.
The lander and ascender combination will then make a soft landing on the South Pole-Aitken Basin and conduct a sample return mission on the far side of the moon as planned.
The entire flight of the Chang'e-6 mission is expected to last about 53 days, consisting of 11 flight phases, according to CNSA.
China has launched the Chang'e-6 spacecraft on Friday to collect and return samples from the moon's far side, which is the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration, according to Xinhua.
The fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program, led and organized by the CNSA, includes four missions: Chang'e-4, Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8, with Chang'e-4 having achieved the world's first soft landing on the back of the moon.
The Chang'e-6 mission will carry out new planetary exploration missions and further upgrade the country's space launch capabilities in the next 15 years. Landing a Chinese national on the moon is expected to happen before 2030, according to previous reports.
The Chang'e-6 mission is also carrying four payloads developed through international cooperation, providing more opportunities for the world's scientists and merging human expertise in space exploration, according to Xinhua.

Researchers date living age of Liujiang Homo sapiens in south China
 (Xinhua) 22:12, May 08, 2024
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have provided new age estimates and revised provenience information for the Liujiang human fossils, which represent one of the most complete fossil skeletons of Homo sapiens in China, according to a recent research article published in Nature Communications.
The emergence of Homo sapiens in Eastern Asia is a topic of significant research interest, while well-preserved human fossils in secure, dateable contexts in this region are extremely rare.
Tongtianyan cave in Liuzhou City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is one of the most important fossils finds of H. sapiens, though its age has been debated, with chronometric dates ranging from the late Middle Pleistocene to the early late Pleistocene.
Through the four-year comprehensive stratigraphic and chronological studies, the researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the Nanjing Normal University and the CAS Institute of Geology and Geophysics have solved a 66-year chronological mystery and dated the Liujiang H. sapiens to between 33,000 and 23,000 years ago.
The revised age estimates correspond with the dates of other human fossils in northern China, including Tianyuan Cave and Zhoukoudian Upper Cave, indicating the geographically widespread presence of H. sapiens across Eastern Asia in the late Pleistocene.
The comprehensive study is significant for integrating the Liujiang human fossils into the early modern human evolutionary sequence and better understanding human dispersals and adaptations in the region.

China's space weather center predicts strong solar flares,2024-05-08,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0508/c90000-20166555.html,"Home>>
		
China's space weather center predicts strong solar flares
 (Xinhua) 15:13, May 08, 2024
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's National Center for Space Weather has predicted that there will be moderate to high levels of solar activity this week, with the possibility of more powerful solar flares.
Among the most intense phenomena from the sun, solar flares are characterized by sudden bursts of brightness in specific areas of the sun's atmosphere. They are often accompanied by an increase in electromagnetic radiation and the release of particles across various energy ranges. Solar flares are rated based on their strength, with A-class as the smallest, followed by B, C, M and X as the most potent.
According to the center, the sun unleashed a strong solar flare, classified as an X4.5, at 2:35 p.m. (Beijing Time) on Monday. Scientists at the space weather center issued a forecast on Tuesday, predicting that there is a possibility of M-class and X-class solar flares occurring in the next three days.
The sun's tantrums also follow a predictable cycle. According to Wang Jingsong, head of the center, the average duration of a Solar Cycle is 11.2 years. The first Solar Cycle commenced in 1755. Currently, the sun is in its 25th Solar Cycle.
The beginning of 2024 saw increased solar activities, with varying degrees of flares erupting in January and February.
Chen Anqin, chief forecaster of the center, said the number of X-class flares per Solar Cycle is approximately 100, and during the peak years, they would occur more frequently at a rate of about 10 to 20 per year.
Since the sun has reached the peak of the Solar Cycle, it is common to experience frequent X-class strong solar flares, Chen added.
The solar flares may affect people's lives on Earth. When solar flares occur, they can cause disruptions in the Earth's ionosphere due to their interaction with the sun. These disruptions have the potential to impact navigation and positioning systems, aviation communications, short-wave communications, as well as other emergency communication networks. They may also pose risks to satellites and in-orbit astronauts.
However, scientists said the impact of the solar flares on Earth would be minimal.
""While these flares can carry a significant amount of electromagnetic radiation and high-energy particles, only a small portion actually reaches the Earth. Moreover, our planet is protected by its own magnetic field, which means that even strong flares have little impact on human health,"" Chen explained, noting that there is no need for the public to worry or take any particular precautions.
Scientists believe that the occurrence of space weather events, such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms, is expected to increase in 2024 and the following year.
In the face of space weather events caused by strong solar activities, China has established a comprehensive system that integrates monitoring, forecasting and providing pertinent services. According to Wang, the system boasts a monitoring capability to accurately predict and provide early warnings for significant space weather phenomena such as geomagnetic storms.
The Chinese space weather center also provides round-the-clock space weather advisory services for global aviation.

Global scientists join hands to rebuild DNA tree of life for plants,2024-05-08,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0508/c90000-20166553.html,"Home>>
		
Global scientists join hands to rebuild DNA tree of life for plants
 (Xinhua) 15:11, May 08, 2024
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have recently revealed a vast DNA tree of life for flowering plants, which represents a pioneering step for illuminating Darwin's ""Abominable Mystery.""
The study, jointly conducted by an international team of researchers from the Kew Gardens, British Royal Botanic Gardens, the Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other institutions and universities, has been published in the journal Nature.
The flowering plant tree of life, much like the family tree of humans, can help demonstrate how different species are related to each other. The tree of life is revealed by comparing DNA sequences between different species to identify changes that accumulate over time, much like a molecular fossil record.
Researchers recently achieved a vast DNA tree of life by bringing open access DNA sequences of more than 9,500 flowering plants together, enabling them to answer key questions about modern plant life and delve into its origins.
One key advantage of this approach is its ability to sequence a wide range of plant material, both old and new, even in cases where the DNA is badly damaged. The vast treasure troves of dried plant material in the world's herbarium collections, which include nearly 400 million scientific plant specimens, can now be studied genetically.
Using such specimens, the researchers sequenced a sandwort specimen (Arenaria globiflora) collected nearly 200 years ago in Nepal and, despite the poor quality of its DNA, were able to place it in the tree of life.
They even analyzed extinct plants, such as the Guadalupe Island olive (Hesperelaea palmeri), which has not been seen alive since 1875. In fact, 511 of the species sequenced are already facing the threat of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, including three more like Hesperelaea that are already extinct.
Of the 9,506 species sequenced for this study, over 3,400 were derived from material sourced from 163 herbaria in 48 countries, with additional material from plant collections around the world such as DNA banks, seeds, and living collections.
Among the species sequenced, more than 800 had never had their DNA sequenced before. This sequencing was essential to fill in important knowledge gaps and shed new light on the evolutionary history of flowering plants. The researchers also benefited from publicly available data for more than 1,900 species, highlighting the value of the open science approach to future genomic research.
Flowering plants originated over 140 million years ago, after which they rapidly overtook other vascular plants. Darwin was puzzled by the seemingly sudden appearance of such diversity in the fossil record and wrote: ""The rapid development, as far as we can judge, of all the higher plants within recent geological times, is an abominable mystery.""
Using 200 fossils, the researchers traced their tree of life back in time to show how flowering plants evolved over geological time. They found that early flowering plants did indeed explode in diversity, as Darwin noted. The rapid development of these plants gave rise, shortly after their origin, to over 80 percent of the major lineages that exist today.
However, this trend then declined to a more stable rate for the next 100 million years, until another surge in diversification occurred about 40 million years ago, coinciding with a global drop in temperature.
These new findings would have fascinated Darwin and will surely help today's scientists as they grapple with the challenges of understanding how and why species diversify.
The flowering plant tree of life has enormous potential for biodiversity research. This is because, just as one can predict the properties of an element based on its position in the periodic table, the location of a species in the tree of life allows researchers to predict its properties. The new data will therefore be invaluable in advancing many areas of science and beyond.
To make this possible, the tree and all its underlying data have been made openly and freely available to both the public and the scientific community, including through the Kew Tree of Life Explorer. The researchers believe that such open access is key to democratizing access to scientific data around the world.
Open access will also help scientists fully harness the potential of the data. For instance, they can combine it with AI to predict which plant species may contain molecules with medicinal potential. Similarly, the tree of life can be used to better understand and predict how pests and diseases will affect plants in the future. Ultimately, the researchers note, the applications of this data will be driven by the ingenuity of the scientists who access it.

"China's Chang'e-6, world-first mission to retrieve samples from far side of moon",2024-05-08,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0508/c90000-20166469.html,"Home>>
		
China's Chang'e-6, world-first mission to retrieve samples from far side of moon
By Yu Sinan, Wang Jingyuan, Zhu Tiantian (People's Daily) 14:28, May 08, 2024
At 5:27 p.m. (Beijing Time), May 3, China's Chang'e-6 spacecraft blasted off at the Wenchang Space Launch Site on the coast of China's southern island province of Hainan.
As an important mission of the fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program, Chang'e-6 will collect and return samples from the moon's mysterious far side -- the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.

According to Wang Qiong, deputy chief designer of the Chang'e-6 mission, the mission needs to see new technological breakthroughs in such areas as lunar retrograde orbit design and control, rapid intelligent sampling, and takeoff from the far side of the moon. It will conduct an automated sample return from the moon's far side, along with scientific exploration of the landing area and international collaboration.
Wang said the scientific goals of the Chang'e-6 mission include on-site investigation and analysis of the landing area on the far side of the moon, and the analysis and study of the samples retrieved from the far side.
The entire flight of the mission is expected to last about 53 days, during which the spacecraft will experience 11 flight stages, including launch and orbit insertion, lunar transfer, among others.
The fourth phase of China's lunar exploration program consists of the Chang'e-4, Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 missions. In January 2019, the Chang'e-4 probe touched down at the target landing area on the far side of the moon, becoming the first spacecraft soft-landing on the moon's uncharted side that is never visible from Earth.
The Chang'e-6 mission marks another step forward in China's lunar exploration program. It has garnered widespread attention for its goal to retrieve samples on the far side of the moon.
Studying lunar samples from different regions and ages can help humans learn more about the moon. However, all 10 lunar sample return missions conducted by humans by far have taken place on the near side of the moon.
The South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon was chosen as the target landing and sampling site for the Chang'e-6 mission. The basin is one of the largest impact craters known in the solar system, one of the three major lunar terranes, and the largest, oldest and deepest basin recognized on the moon. It might be home to aged lunar rocks, making it highly valuable for scientific research.
After the Chang'e-6 spacecraft retrieves lunar samples from the far side of the moon, scientists are expected to carry out systematic and long-term laboratory research on the samples, including analysis of the structure, physical properties and composition of lunar soil, which will enhance humanity's understanding of the formation and evolution of the moon.
The rugged terrain of the moon's far side poses great challenges for its landing. Wang noted that scientists can obtain basic information about the landing site through satellite remote sensing images, but detailed conditions still remain unknown. For instance, the landing could be affected by certain rocks on the lunar surface. Therefore, technological means is necessary to adjust the spacecraft's landing trajectory to ensure it reaches the desired landing area during the descent. Once the lunar mission is completed, the Chang'e-6 will embark on its journey back home.
Practical international collaboration is one of the distinctive features of the Chang'e-6 mission. It is reported that in April 2019, China announced a cooperation plan for the Chang'e-6 mission, and decided to carry four payloads developed through international cooperation with the spacecraft, including the European Space Agency's lunar surface ion analyzer, France's radon detection instrument, Italy's laser corner reflector, and a CubeSat from Pakistan.
On May 3, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) convened a workshop focusing on the international payloads carried by Chang'e-6 in Haikou, south China's Hainan province. Around 50 guests from 12 countries and international organizations were invited to attend the workshop, discussed cooperation and witnessed the launch of the spacecraft.
Hu Hao, chief designer of the Chang'e-6 mission, noted that China places great importance on international cooperation in developing its lunar exploration program, and is committed to keeping the door open for collaboration with the international community.
It is reported that China is currently speeding up the development of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). Recently, three new partners have joined the ILRS program, namely Nicaragua, the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization and the Arab Union for Astronomy and Space Sciences.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe has successfully entered its circumlunar orbit, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said on Wednesday.
At 10:12 a.m. (Beijing Time) Wednesday, Chang'e-6 successfully performed a near-moon braking procedure before entering the circumlunar orbit, according to the CNSA.
The near-moon braking procedure is a key orbital control for Chang'e-6 during its flight. The braking makes its relative speed lower than the lunar escape velocity, so that it can be captured by the moon's gravity and fly around the moon.
Supported by Queqiao-2 relay satellite, Chang'e-6 will later adjust the altitude and inclination of the orbit around the moon, and choose a proper time to carry out the separation of the orbiter-returner combination and the lander-ascender combination.
Then the lander-ascender combination will conduct a soft landing on the South Pole-Aitken Basin to carry out the sampling and return mission on the far side of the moon as planned.

Researchers unveil different response patterns of tumor-infiltrating B cells
 (Xinhua) 21:58, May 07, 2024
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have unveiled two different response patterns of tumor-infiltrating B cells, with implications for the immunotherapy treatment of cancer, according to a research article published recently in the journal Science.
B cells have long been considered an important component of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cells, although whether they play a positive or negative role in anti-tumor immunity remains highly controversial.
In this study, using comprehensive single-cell multiomic analyses of B cells across 20 cancer types, the researchers from the Shanghai Institute of Immunity and Infection (SIII) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fudan University and Zhejiang University classified the responses of different tumor-infiltrating B cells in relation to different cancer types.
They found that different B cell responses were associated with different tumor immunities and prognosis outcomes.
In addition, through extensive analyses, the researchers determined the molecular features and the differentiation pathways of the atypical memory (AtM) B cells.
Zhang Xiaoming, professor with the SIII, said that the researchers did not expect to identify a negative role for AtM B cells within tumors, and this knowledge could open up new avenues for cancer immunotherapy by targeted dampening or depletion of AtM B cells.
The study deepens the understanding of the different functions of tumor-infiltrating B cells. It may offer new treatment options for cancer patients who do not respond well to existing immunotherapies, the research article noted.
With mechanistic insights and clinical validation, B-cell-targeted therapies may complement other types of immunotherapy in the near future.

Fat-nurtured microbes in gut promote cancer progression: study
 (Xinhua) 16:51, May 07, 2024
GUANGZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese cancer researchers has uncovered a novel mechanism through which obesity-related microbes in one's gut can promote cancer progression. It involves the release of specific chemicals that can have a significant impact on the growth and spread of cancer cells.
A high-fat diet (HFD) is widely considered a significant risk factor for the malignant progression of various cancers, largely due to its disruptive effects on intestinal microbiota. However, the precise role of HFD in the development of cancer was previously not fully understood.
The researchers from Sun Yat-sen University established multiple models in cancer-bearing mice and found that fat-nurtured microbiota released abundant leucine, an amino acid found in many proteins.
An elevated leucine level in peripheral blood has been found to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in female patients with breast cancer, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States.
In addition, abnormal gut microbiota are implicated in the development of resistance to chemotherapy and some immune therapies for breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma.
The findings of this study open a broad avenue for anticancer therapeutic strategies by targeting the aberrant metabolism of gut microbiota, the researchers said.

China's AG600 amphibious aircraft completes initial water-rescue verification
 (Xinhua) 16:34, May 07, 2024
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's independently-developed AG600 large amphibious aircraft has completed the initial verification of its water-rescue capabilities, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).
An AG600 tech-demonstrator in late April carried out the water-rescue verification at the reservoir of the amphibian Zhanghe Airport in Jingmen in central China's Hubei Province, said the AVIC, China's leading aircraft manufacturer.
This move is key for the AG600 large amphibious aircraft to effectively meet the demands arising from the country's emergency-rescue system construction efforts, said the AVIC.
It also marks a new major breakthrough for the AG600 aircraft family and provides tech-support for the follow-up development of the search-and-rescue variant, the developer added.
China's AG600 large amphibious aircraft family is being developed as vital advanced aeronautical equipment to strengthen the country's emergency-rescue capabilities. The aircraft family is tailored to carry out rescue missions such as firefighting, and maritime search and rescue in all types of terrains across the country.
The AG600 series amphibious aircraft features a unique configuration consisting of an integrated aircraft-shaped upper body and ship-bottom-shaped lower body.
During the verification tests, the AG600 tech-demonstrator cooperated well with rescuers on the surface of the reservoir and verified its water-rescue mode. Tests were carried out on the aircraft's landing and rescue on water surface, as well as its airdrop, said the AVIC.
This round of verification tests verified the aircraft's performance during the whole process from the launching to the recovery of lifeboat from a large cabin door on the aircraft's rear fuselage.
Also, the verification tests were carried out on the application of the airdrop equipment and the effect of survival parachute airdrop.
Via the tests, this large amphibious aircraft's performance of flying in low speeds at low altitudes and maneuvering on water surface were further verified, the developer said.
Moreover, multiple major capabilities for the aircraft to carry out water rescue missions have been verified, such as the collaboration among various participants, standardized operations and actions, and necessary task systems for rescue use, among others.
Following up, more tests will be conducted to verify the AG600's performance in maritime rescue.
The AG600 large amphibious aircraft will become a key member of China's maritime emergency search-and-rescue system by undertaking tasks such as searching for targets, rescuing people, airdrop rescue and onboard medical treatment, according to the AVIC.
AG600 will contribute to the building of the country's three-dimensional maritime search-and-rescue system in joint efforts with the commanding centers and other rescue forces and units, the AVIC added.

NASA, Boeing postpone launch of Starliner spacecraft due to technical issues
 (Xinhua) 12:59, May 07, 2024
LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- NASA and Boeing postponed the launch of the first crewed mission of Starliner spacecraft on Monday due to technical issues.
The spacecraft was scheduled to launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket at 10:34 p.m. Eastern Time Monday (0234 GMT Tuesday) from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in the U.S. state of Florida.
The flight test will carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station.
The launch was scrubbed as teams were evaluating an oxygen relief valve on the Centaur upper stage on the Atlas V rocket, according to NASA. The two astronauts have exited Starliner and will return to crew quarters.
This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing's spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency's Commercial Crew Program.

Chinese scientists achieve significant advancement in quantum simulation technology
 (Xinhua) 22:18, May 06, 2024
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has realized the fractional quantum anomalous Hall state of photons for the first time by using an independently developed quantum experimental system, the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) said on Monday.
Previously, the fractional quantum anomalous Hall state, a bizarre quantum phenomenon, was mostly observed in electrons. But the USTC research team uses photons to simulate it.
This breakthrough in quantum simulation technology is expected to propel advancements in quantum physics research and quantum computing, said Pan Jianwei, a renowned Chinese quantum physicist and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), at a press conference.
The team from the USTC, led by Pan and Lu Chaoyang, has independently developed and named a new type of superconducting qubit, Plasmonium in the research.
This groundbreaking achievement has successfully addressed two crucial challenges in realizing the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect with photons, providing new means for experimental observation and manipulation of quantum.
The synthetic, controllable, and more powerful quantum simulation approach, which breaks free from the limitations of natural systems, can be utilized to investigate further mysteries of quantum states and explore the realization of fault-tolerant universal quantum computation, Pan said.
The Hall effect refers to the phenomenon where a voltage is generated perpendicular to the direction of both the current and the magnetic field when a current passes through a material placed in a magnetic field. This effect was discovered by American scientist Edwin Hall in 1879 and has been widely applied in the field of electromagnetic sensing.
The anomalous Hall effect refers to the observation of related effects without the need for an external magnetic field. In 2013, a Chinese research team observed the integer quantum anomalous Hall effect. In 2023, research teams from both the United States and China independently observed the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect.
The conventional approach for studying the quantum Hall effect in experiments involves utilizing the existing structure and properties of specific materials to prepare the quantum Hall state, which requires stringent experimental conditions including extremely low-temperature environments, high purity of two-dimensional materials, and strong magnetic fields.
Furthermore, the traditional methods face challenges in independently manipulating and measuring the microscopic quantum states of the system at single-point positions, limiting their applications in quantum information science.
The artificially constructed quantum system, on the contrary, offers a clear and flexible structure and provide researchers with greater control and manipulation capabilities, making it a new paradigm for studying complex quantum states, Lu said.
This system does not require an external magnetic field. Through high-precision control, it enables comprehensive measurements of the microscopic properties of highly integrated quantum systems. Furthermore, it allows for further controlled utilization of these properties, Lu added.
This type of technology is known as quantum simulation and is an important component of the second quantum revolution. It is expected to be applied in the near future to simulate quantum system that is computationally challenging for classical computers, ultimately achieving quantum computational supremacy.
This achievement is expected to have a significant impact on the future development of quantum technology, said Chang Jin, vice president of the CAS, at the press conference.
""We hope that the development of quantum technology will continue to advance through the efforts of the global scientific community and international cooperation. By transforming the achievements of relevant basic research into key technologies that drive social progress and economic development, quantum technology will become the innovative force and source of new quality productive forces,"" Chang said.
""This is a remarkable achievement, both scientifically and technically, and reaching such a goal has been one of the holy grails of quantum simulation for many years in many laboratories worldwide,"" said Peter Zoller, winner of the Wolf Prize in Physics and also a chair professor at the University of Innsbruck.
Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate in physics, praised the study as ""a very promising idea"" and ""a very impressive experiment"" that represents ""a remarkable step"" in quantum information processing.
The study was published Friday in the journal Science.

Scientists develop heat-resistant aluminum alloys for aerospace applications,2024-05-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0506/c90000-20165311.html,"Home>>
		
Scientists develop heat-resistant aluminum alloys for aerospace applications
 (Xinhua) 18:19, May 06, 2024
TIANJIN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has developed a novel high-strength aluminum alloy that remains operational even at staggering 500 degrees Celsius.
This advancement has extended the service temperature range of aluminum alloys from 350 to over 400 degrees Celsius, addressing a long-standing engineering challenge.
The demands of the aerospace industry have set higher standards for the thermal resistance of lightweight metal materials.
Although aluminum alloys are favored for their low density, superior strength and robust corrosion resistance, their relatively low heat-resistance posed a considerable challenge, especially within the crucial temperature range of 350 to 500 degrees Celsius, which is pivotal for aerospace applications.
Researchers at Tianjin University synthesized aluminum alloys embedded with highly-dispersive nanoparticles. The nanoparticles have in-situ grown graphene-like coatings, which significantly contribute to a substantial reduction in surface energy.
Thanks to the incorporation of these nanoparticles, the alloys exhibit exceptional creep resistance at elevated temperatures of up to 500 degrees Celsius, according to the study published recently in the journal Nature Materials.
Also, they boast an impressive tensile strength of approximately 200 megapascals at that temperature, about six times higher than ordinary aluminium alloys.
This innovative process is characterized by its simplicity, minimal material costs, and scalability, making it highly valuable for industrial applications, said He Chunnian from Tianjin University, the corresponding author of the paper.

World's largest deinonychosaur tracks discovered in China's Fujian,2024-05-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0506/c90000-20165274.html,"Home>>
		
World's largest deinonychosaur tracks discovered in China's Fujian
 (Xinhua) 16:48, May 06, 2024
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have discovered large two-toed tracks in Lincheng Town, Fujian Province, east China, which belong to deinonychosaurs, the scientist team said Monday.
At least eight types of dinosaur tracks have been found over the years at the Longxiang tracksite by scientists and experts from China University of Geosciences and Yingliang Stone Natural History Museum, 12 of which are didactyl deinonychosaur tracks that fall into two morphologies.
Among the 12 two-toed fossil tracks, five large tracks measuring 36.4 cm in length and 16.9 cm in width, on average, led researchers to establish a new dinosaur taxon: Fujianipus yingliangi.
Based on relative toe-proportions, Fujianipus is a probable troodontid.
""These are currently the largest deinonychosaur tracks found in China and beyond,"" said Xing Lida, an associate professor at China University of Geosciences, adding that based on the size of the tracks, it is estimated that Fujianipus was at least 5 meters long, with a hip height of nearly 2 meters.
""The Longxian tracksite is the best-preserved, largest area, and most diverse Late Cretaceous dinosaur tracksite discovered in China to date,"" said Niu Kecheng, curator of Yingliang Stone Natural History Museum.
The discovery of the Fujianipus yingliangi greatly expands the size range of deinonychosaur tracks, which is of great significance for the study of the Late Cretaceous dinosaurs in China, Niu added.
The discovery was recently published in the international journal iScience.
