Scientists aim to unravel human brain mysteries via space station
 (Xinhua) 15:05, March 12, 2024
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- How does the space environment affect human brain function, and how does the brain adapt to it?
Chinese scientists hope to find clues to these questions using China's Tiangong space station, which is orbiting about 400 km above Earth.
As China's space station enters the application and development stage, one of the astronauts' main tasks is to carry out scientific experiments. Among them is the in-orbit electroencephalogram (EEG) test, which focuses on the human brain in space.
According to Wang Bo, a researcher from the China Astronaut Research and Training Center, an in-orbit EEG test platform has recently been established. As a safe, reliable, portable, and easy-to-use platform, it can be used to carry out all kinds of EEG research experiments.
""Starting from the Shenzhou-11 mission, we have started the first EEG experiment and verified the applicability of brain-computer interaction technology in orbit through brain-controlled robots,"" said Wang.
""We then carried out dozens of in-orbit EEG tests, built up a platform, developed several research paradigms, and realized some model tests,"" he added.
In collaboration with several batches of astronauts, researchers from the China Astronaut Research and Training Center have developed a series of standard procedures for EEG testing through ground screening and in-orbit validation.
According to Wang, there are three research objectives. ""We hope to know what kind of effects the space environment has on the human brain, how the brain adapts to the environment in space and remodels its nerves, and finally, we want to develop or validate some brain enhancement techniques.""
He added that, in the long run, the in-orbit EEG test could explore the mysteries of brain evolution in the universe and provide new ideas for the development of brain-like intelligence.
Some breakthroughs have already been made. For example, the research team has developed a brain load classification model of multiple dimensions that integrates physiological, performance, and behavioral data, improving the classification accuracy. The team has also made some achievements in modeling data on brain fatigue, brain load, and alertness.
In addition to academic research, EEG testing in a space station also supports astronauts' long-term stay in space, helping them maintain a good state of brain function and carry out their work efficiently.
Astronauts perform many complex and delicate operations in space, so it is important for the human brain to maintain a good state, Wang explained. ""We expect to enhance this ability through brain stimulations and other technologies so as to maximize the role of human beings in space.""
""At first, the astronauts are guided into a resting state, where we collect data of a relatively smooth period that serves as a baseline,"" said Cao Yong, a researcher from the China Astronaut Research and Training Center.
""Then, after the resting, the astronaut will carry out a series of operations, generating new response data. We will combine the EEG data to comprehensively determine the astronaut's brain load status,"" Cao added.
In order to find better ways to enhance the astronauts' brain function, the researchers have explored a great deal in the design of the experimental process, acquisition hardware, and analysis algorithms, Cao said.
Furthermore, brain-computer interaction is currently a hotspot on the frontier of science and technology. It is expected to play an important role in the space environment.
This technology is to transform human thinking into an operation instruction, which is very beneficial for multi-threaded operations and remote operations, Wang said.
It is expected to be applied in some complex extravehicular activities, as well as human-machine cooperations, to ultimately improve the overall efficiency, he added.

Scientists design brain analysis chip, inspired by space exploration
 (Xinhua) 14:43, March 12, 2024
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese brain scientists got inspired by space exploration and designed a real-time analysis system for whole-brain imaging of zebrafish, a model animal used in biomedical research to mimic biological processes or diseases found in humans.
The revolutionary neural recording technology has enabled dynamic measurements of large-scale neuronal clusters, but the subsequent real-time analysis of those massive dynamical imaging data remains a challenge.
The researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences realized that high-throughput neural data analysis is similar to how scientists deal with fast radio burst observations in astronomical research.
Emulating the processing approach of mysterious radio flashes in the universe, they developed a specific chip designed with a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) for an up to 500-megabyte-per-second image stream.
According to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Neuroscience, the FPGA-GPU system can timely extract activities from up to 100,000 neurons in awake larval zebrafish.
The researchers also demonstrated an effective brain-computer interface strategy using the real-time system. It adjusted the activities of swimming-control neurons of zebrafish in a state of paralysis.

China's advancements in global innovation dynamics inspiring
By Liu Hua (China Daily) 14:08, March 12, 2024

Jin Ding/China Daily
The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and the release of the first text-generated video model Sora last month symbolize key advancements in frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, big data, metaverse and Web 3.0. These advancements are catalyzing a new scientific and technological revolution, transforming every aspect of human life.
The World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index 2022 identifies two primary innovation waves shaping the future: a ""digital age wave"" propelled by supercomputing, AI and automation; and a ""deep science wave"" driven by advances in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and new materials. The convergence of these waves promises to redefine innovation across industries.
According to the WIPO's World IP Report 2022, there has been 172 percent growth in digital innovations from 2016-20, with AI, big data and cloud computing leading this surge. Three critical trends underscore the evolving landscape of global innovation.
The first is the eastward shift of innovation hubs. Asia now accounts for 70 percent of global IP applications, up from 50 percent two decades ago, with East Asia being host to six of the top 10 science and technology clusters. This shift reflects the leading global position of Asia in the advancement of technology.
The second is collaborative exchange of innovation. The top science and technology clusters are deepening collaboration, particularly in patent applications and research publications, highlighting the importance of openness and cooperation in the innovation process.
The third trend is of enterprise-led innovation. Enterprises are spearheading the advancement in technologies, with companies like Mitsubishi Electric, Sony, BOE, Baidu, Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo and ZTE leading the charge in their respective clusters, reflecting the pivotal role of enterprises in the innovation ecosystem.
Frontier technologies such as AI and the metaverse highlight the growing importance of and challenges facing IP in fostering growth and development. The challenges include safeguarding AI algorithms, establishing patent and copyrights criteria for AI innovations and AI-generated content, and integrating virtual and real-world assets' intellectual property rights (IPR). The evolving digital landscape calls for an adaptable IPR system that would promote innovation in a way that benefits all stakeholders, including small and medium-sized enterprises, women and youths.
The WIPO has been at the forefront of addressing these issues through its WIPO Conversation on IP and Frontier Technologies series. Since 2019, eight sessions have convened global experts from among stakeholders at all levels.
A particularly impactful session was the eighth, dedicated to generative AI and IP, attracting more than 5,000 participants from 162 countries to discuss the implications of AI on IP policy and regulation. The upcoming ninth session, themed ""Training the Machines-Bytes, Rights, and the Copyright Conundrum"", scheduled for March 13-14, will focus on the critical role of training data in AI development, addressing quality, bias and accessibility issues. The session aims to foster a deeper understanding of training data's influence on the IP ecosystem, inviting a wide range of participants to contribute to the future of AI and creative industries.
China's advancements in frontier technologies
China has made remarkable achievements in digital frontier technologies like AI, 5G and cloud computing, becoming a leader in innovation. China's information and communications technology (ICT) patents comprise 14 percent of the global total. By the end of 2023, the most rapidly growing sectors in China's domestic patent registrations were IT methods for management, computer technology and basic communication processes, with year-on-year increases of 59.4 percent, 39.3 percent and 30.8 percent respectively. This growth underscores China's robust innovations in digital technology, significantly contributing to the digital economy's high-quality development, which now exceeds 50 trillion yuan ($6.94 trillion) and accounts for more than 40 percent of its GDP.
Intellectual property has emerged as a crucial driver of innovation and creativity, playing a vital role in China's high-quality development strategy. To develop new quality productive forces, it is imperative that China strengthen intellectual property protection. In February, the WIPO Office in China highlighted the achievements of Chinese companies in frontier technologies, providing a platform for sharing best practices and exploring IP's role in innovation.
Tech giants such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, BOE, Douyin and Oppo are leading the way through technological innovation. In fact, Huawei invested more than 80 billion yuan in R&D in the first half of 2023 alone, securing numerous patents, trademarks and designs, and it is the largest user of WIPO's PCT system for international patent registration. Such IPR protection supports Huawei's growth but also helps advance the ICT industry.
Additionally, new energy companies such as BYD, GCL ET, and Goldwind are promoting innovation in blade battery technology (lithium battery), photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, enhancing the export potential of China's emerging industries. Small and medium-sized enterprises such as Xi'an KissFuture, Shanghai Westwell and Beijing IICT have become industry leaders by leveraging AI in digital cinema, green port logistics and urban traffic management. As a matter of fact, Xi'an KissFuture and Shanghai Westwell were awarded the 2nd WIPO Global Awards, distinguishing them from the rest of the 548 competitors from 58 countries.
Milestones in IP and innovation in 50 years
The 50th anniversary of the collaboration between the WIPO and China, celebrated in Beijing and Geneva, underscores China's tradition of innovation, which goes back 5000 years. WIPO Director General Daren Tang said the occasion was a testament to China's remarkable progress in IPR and its pivotal role in leveraging IP to foster socioeconomic development.
China's contribution to global IP filings is unparalleled, holding leading positions in the WIPO's PCT, Madrid, and Hague systems for international IP registrations. By the end of last year, China had set a new global benchmark with 4.99 million valid invention patents, including 4.01 million domestic patents — making it the first country to surpass 4 million valid domestic invention patents.
In the 2023 Global Innovation Index, China ranked 12th; it was the only middle-income country to break into the top 15. This achievement is further bolstered by its leadership in science and technology clusters, boasting 24 of the world's top clusters, including Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai-Suzhou, which are respectively ranked 2nd, 4th, and 5th globally.
The ascent of China's innovation-driven economy reflects comprehensive strength across all facets of the innovation ecosystem, marking a significant chapter in the country's enduring legacy of creativity and invention.
The WIPO envisions a bright future for innovation and creativity in China, and it remains dedicated to working alongside Chinese stakeholders to harness the opportunities and tackle the challenges presented by emerging technologies. The WIPO's goal is to cultivate a more open and inclusive global IP ecosystem, and using the IP system to promote innovation, sustainable development and economic growth.
Serving as the WIPO's arm in China, the WIPO Office in China will act as a crucial link, fostering connections between the market, stakeholders and the media. Embracing new technologies, new generations and new initiatives, the WIPO Office in China aims to highlight China's exemplary IP practices and accomplishments, and provide targeted, timely and tailored services in the country to promote new quality productive forces.
The views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.

China aims to accelerate research and development of key core technologies and application-oriented technological innovations this year, with a focus on developing a faster bullet train capable of traveling at 450 kilometers per hour and intelligent high-speed rail technologies, said Liu Zhenfang, the president of China State Railway Group, which operates the national railway system.
Liu, who is also a deputy to the 14th National People's Congress, said the company will continue to promote independent research and the industrial application of key core technologies this year, enhancing self-reliance in railway technology.
""Technological innovation can foster new industries, new models and new momentum,"" he said. ""It is the core element for developing new quality productive forces.
""China's high-speed railways are a successful example of independent innovation in our country, and the overall technological level of China's railways has entered the forefront of the world.""
The group plans to unveil a more advanced bullet train, the CR450-with a top operating speed of 400 km/h and an experimental speed of up to 450 km/h — by next year.
It plans to complete a prototype this year and begin testing.
Liu said achievements in promoting self-reliance in railway technology had been made last year.
""In 2023, the alliance to promote science and technology innovation in the railway sector was established,"" he said. ""The CR450 science and technology innovation project has achieved major breakthroughs.""
Last year, bullet trains traveled at speeds of 453 km/h on test runs in Fujian province, collecting data on trains running at different speeds on tracks that include tunnels, bridges and curves.
Currently, the fastest bullet trains in China operate at speeds of 350 km/h along several lines, including the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway and the Beijing-Tianjin High-Speed Railway.
A train traveling at 400 km/h would shorten the journey from Beijing to Shanghai to 2.5 hours.
Liu also said China aims to achieve technological breakthroughs to improve operational safety, enhancing key equipment and infrastructure.
""Research efforts will be increased in the application of cutting-edge technologies in the field of railways,"" he said.
""We'll focus on promoting the system's informatization and network security and enhancing the construction of digital railways. We'll also carry out the standardization, interconnection and sharing of railway information systems, aiming to empower the innovative development of railways through digital intelligence.""
By the end of last year, China's national railway network extended for 159,000 km, including 45,000 km of high-speed lines. About 80 percent of China's planned high-speed railway network has been completed, with a further 15 percent under construction.
""China's overall level of railway infrastructure has reached the forefront globally, providing the foundation and conditions for further advancement toward a higher level of modernization,"" Liu said.
He said China aims to have 165,000 km of track by the end of next year, 50,000 km of which will be high-speed.
According to the national plan, by 2035, the railway network in China will reach 200,000 km, with about 70,000 km of high-speed lines, including some high-speed inter-city railways.

Program targets lunar resources
By Zhao Lei (China Daily) 09:39, March 12, 2024
China has made remarkable achievements in lunar exploration, with two robots still working on the moon. The country has also announced plans for the coming years, including retrieving samples from the moon's far side.
However, those ambitious endeavors are not only related to science, but also embrace a magnificent aspiration: to find and develop resources on the moon for the good of mankind, according to a leading scientist in China's lunar program.

Yang Mengfei
""This year marks the 20th year since our country started its lunar exploration program. Along with the development of our lunar exploration, we will pay more attention to the research and utilization of resources on the moon, and that is in line with the purposes of other space powers in their recent adventures to the moon,"" Yang Mengfei, a senior researcher at the China Academy of Space Technology and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said.
""The first step will be sending large numbers of robots to search for resource-rich places, especially those with recoverable frozen water. Water is paramount to our effort of establishing a long-term human presence on the moon — with it, we will be able to make oxygen and hydrogen and grow plants there. And then we will come out to find other resources like metal and silicon minerals and then put them into an advanced extraction and refinement process.""
After that, 3D printers will turn the metals and silicon into construction materials or solar panels to be used to build roads, structures and power stations, Yang said.
""By that time, humans will be able to set up bases that can support long-term robotic operations and short-duration human stays,"" he said. ""Astronauts can manufacture scientific apparatuses like radio telescopes inside such facilities and place the hardware near bases — the absence of atmosphere and electromagnetic interference makes the lunar surface perfect for astronomical observation.""
Yang said the bases could also be used to refuel spacecraft carrying humans to distant destinations inside the solar system.
He said advances in science and technology mean it will likely become possible to extract helium-3, an ideal fuel for future nuclear fusion power plants, from the moon.
It is estimated there are 15 to 20 metric tons of helium-3 on Earth, but experts say there could be at least 1 million tons on the moon.
""Of course it will be very difficult but if we could make it happen, then it will be a very big deal to humans on Earth,"" Yang said.
He said that to realize the grand road map, Chinese scientists and engineers have started designing an Earth-moon spacecraft telecommand and communications system that will be capable of transmitting data and providing positioning and navigation service to spaceships traveling between them.
Yang also shared his vision for the next 50 years.
""My optimistic anticipation is that ordinary people will be able to travel between Earth and the moon in the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""Advances in science and technology will definitely move our civilizations forward. When moon-bound journeys become available to commoners like you and me, the moon will then become mankind's eighth continent.""
Yang is widely known for leading the design work on the Chang'e 5 robotic spacecraft that fulfilled China's first lunar sample retrieval mission.
He was speaking on the sidelines of the second session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which concluded in Beijing on Sunday. He is a member of the CPPCC National Committee, the top political advisory body in China.
China began its lunar program in 2004 and has launched six robotic probes since 2007. The most recent mission, Chang'e 5, landed on the moon in December 2020 and soon brought 1,731 grams of lunar rocks and soil back to Earth, achieving a historic accomplishment about 44 years after the last lunar substances were brought back from our nearest celestial neighbor.

Chinese researchers uncover secrets behind adult fireflies' light organs
 (Xinhua) 16:42, March 11, 2024
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently revealed key mechanisms related to the development of adult light organs in fireflies, providing new insights to the study of bioluminescence and the flash signal control in insects.
Adult fireflies exhibit unique flashing courtship signals, emitted by specialized light organs, which develop mostly independently from larval light organs during the pupal stage. The mechanisms of adult light organ development have not been thoroughly studied.
In this regard, researchers at the Huazhong Agricultural University used comparative genomics, comparative transcriptomics and gene interference techniques to study the light organs in the early, middle and late development of the firefly Aquatica leii.
They discovered that the key homeobox transcription factors AlAbd-B and AlUnc-4 regulate the development of adult light organs and bioluminescence in the fireflies. Interference with the expression of AlAbd-B and AlUnc-4 genes would result in undeveloped or non-luminescent adult light organs. AlAbd-B regulates AlUnc-4, and they interact with each other.
The shape and flash frequency of adult light organs are the basis of the firefly biodiversity, said Fu Xinhua, a professor at the university, adding that figuring out the development mechanisms is conducive to the protection of the firefly biodiversity.
The discovery was published in the journal Nature Communication.

China set to narrow AI gap with firm efforts
By Cheng Yu (China Daily) 09:35, March 11, 2024

MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY
During the ongoing two sessions, the Chinese government has unequivocally put the development of the domestic artificial intelligence industry high on its agenda — and this should help allay any lingering concerns that the country is lagging behind advanced economies in key technologies, experts said.
The latest concerns arose in February when US firm OpenAI, which had created a sensation with ChatGPT, launched a text-to-video model called Sora, sending ripples through China's AI industry. Reactions ranged from admiration and appreciation to ""AI anxiety"".
Why weren't groundbreaking technologies like ChatGPT and Sora emerging in China? Is the AI gap between China and the United States widening? Has China lost the tech plot? Has its innovation drive lost its edge? Questions like that have stoked anxiety among both netizens and industry experts alike.
It is natural to have such anxiety, but what it indicates really is the underlying sense of urgency to catch up with huge changes brought by cutting-edge technologies, said Shen Hao, deputy chief engineer of the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Research Institute.
Industry insiders believe Sora — it allows users to create photo-realistic videos up to a minute-long, all based on prompts they have written — will actually end up narrowing the AI gap between China and the US. For, Chinese companies will likely soon ramp up their efforts to make similar products, given their unique advantages.
But they also believe Sora is a wake-up call for China as it shows there is a gap with US counterparts in terms of AI development, especially in aspects like computing power and talent.
""The gap between China and the US in AI mainly lies in (tech) direction. Once the direction is settled, Chinese companies can quickly catch up using their rapid learning capabilities,"" said Zhou Hongyi, founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology, who is also a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body.
Zhou explained that the direction could be transformer, a deep learning model that learns context and meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data. Both ChatGPT and Sora are based on transformers.
""There is a gap between China and the US in terms of AI development. But the gap is not as big as the one in semiconductor lithography machines.
""Considering that transformer, Sora or Sora-like products are all fundamentally 'software', such an AI gap between China and the US can be bridged within one to two years,"" Zhou said.
From December to February, more than 10 A-share companies operating in AI-related fields, including Wondershare, BroadV, Eclicktech and Hanvon Technology, had all disclosed their investment and progress in the development of text-to-video models.
Although the current text-to-video technologies developed by Chinese companies are less effective than Sora, industry experts believe that China already has all the core infrastructure required to develop Sora-like products, including large language models, DALL.E 3, large-scale video data sets, AI computing power systems and large model development tool stacks.
LLMs serve as foundation models, or general-purpose models pre-trained on huge datasets. DALL.E 3 is an AI system that takes a text prompt as input and generates a new image as output.
Ma Xin, secretary-general of the IEEE metaverse standards committee and chairman of the IEEE metaverse standards working group, said that Sora does have a strong visual impact, but it does not break away from ChatGPT and DALL.E to reach another level.
""Sora's capabilities are all perceived — they exist only in people's minds. In the short term, it can only help improve efficiency, in terms of interaction with people, but it's not possible to truly penetrate the industrial field,"" Ma said.
Zhou Chengxiong, an analyst from the Institutes of Science and Development of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: ""Although most of the current major breakthroughs in AI technology emerge from US companies, latecomers also have obvious advantages. For instance, latecomers face fewer risks and uncertainties during the progress.""
China has a huge opportunity to be at the forefront of the world in the application of AI technologies in the future, he said.
Concurred Wang Peng, a senior expert from the Tencent Research Institute. Wang said Sora's launch further proves that diffusion transformer is a feasible direction for multi-modal AI.
DiTs adhere to the best practices of vision transformers, which have been shown to scale more effectively for visual recognition than traditional convolutional networks.
""It is still possible for major Chinese AI manufacturers to leverage existing resources to catch up with Sora's current level in about a year,"" he said.
Last month, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, of the State Council, China's Cabinet, said the country will push centrally administered state-owned enterprises to integrate the development of AI into their overall planning, actively promote industrial renewal and accelerate the layout and development of the AI industry.
On Tuesday, the Government Work Report submitted to the national legislature for deliberation assured that China will promote innovative development of the digital economy, actively develop the digital industry, transform traditional industries with digital technologies, and fully integrate digital technology into the real economy.
Specifically, the country will step up the launch of an AI Plus initiative, R&D and application of big data and AI, and build digital industry clusters with international competitiveness, the report said.
Chinese companies have also been racing to launch AI large models to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-4.0. Earlier, Baidu, Sense-Time and AI startups such as Baichuan Intelligent Technology and Zhipu AI released their AI chatbots.
Zhou Yu, chairman of Beijing Fanyu Technology Co, a startup specializing in natural language processing products and services, said that as the stakes are high, Chinese and US startups appear to be adopting different approaches to developing LLMs that drive generative AI.
""Founders of US startups put more emphasis on the research and development of underlying technology and groundbreaking innovations. The US is a world leader in terms of hardware and deep learning frameworks,"" Zhou said.
""Chinese AI startups focus more on applications, and those launching these startups are better at adapting technology to various industries, and commercializing different applications. They are also more flexible in creating personalized products and innovations,"" she added.
Zhou Hongyi from 360 said that 2024 should be the ""year of application"" for Chinese AI, believing that large models will have great potential in many vertical fields of enterprises this year.
""Developing a universal large model that surpasses GPT-4.0 may be challenging at the moment, but GPT-4.0 currently knows everything, yet is not specialized,"" Zhou said.
""If we can excel in a particular business domain by training a large model with unique business data and integrating it with many business tools within that vertical sector, such a large model will not only have intelligence, but also possess unique knowledge, even hands and feet. It is entirely possible for China to surpass GPT-4.0 in some vertical domains.""
Not everyone agreed though. Wang Peng, a researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said China should make more efforts to fill the gap with the US in AI development, especially in key technologies and related supporters.
""Computing power, cloud servers and AI chips are critical to the AI industry, and their technical level and performance directly determine the depth of AI applications. China still has an obvious gap with the US in terms of these key drivers,"" Wang said.
Chen Zhi, a researcher with the Institute of Innovation and Development, the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, said: ""But for both China and the US, the path to AI development is challenging and requires substantial effort.

NANJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications have developed an intelligent DNA nano-device for thrombolytic therapy, which can automatically find blood clots and achieve precise drug delivery.
The research team used DNA origami technology to integrate DNA nano-sheets with predesigned tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) binding sites and thrombin-responsive DNA fasteners. The fastener is an interlocking DNA triplex structure that acts as a thrombin recognizer, threshold controller and opening switch.
""Thrombolytic drugs are a double-edged sword and can be dangerous if not adopted properly. The drugs may indiscriminately dissolve the fibrin in normal wounds, resulting in abnormal clotting function and, in severe cases, open wounds and bleeding,"" said Wang Lianhui, a member of the research team.
However, this nano-device can determine whether they are near a blood clot or a wound based on the concentration of thrombin. If the concentration is high, it suggests that the location has a thrombus and the device will then release the drug.
The device can be degraded and metabolized in the human body, the researchers said, adding that it is expected to provide a new solution for the treatment of diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
The study has been published online in the journal Nature Materials.

Nuclear power has massive potential to boost green electricity development in China and should be included in the country's green electricity system for low-carbon development, according to national legislators, political advisers and industry experts.
Nuclear-generated power should be certified as green electricity in China, as the country's expanding fleet of nuclear generators is capable of providing over 160 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, said Yang Changli, chairman of China General Nuclear Power Group, China's largest nuclear power operator by installed capacity.
""Including nuclear power in the green electricity certificate system can help provide an authoritative certification platform for the green and low-carbon attributes of nuclear power, meeting the purchasing demands of the market,"" said Yang, who is also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
China established a green electricity certification system in 2017 to promote the transformation and development of green and low-carbon energy. Wind and solar power sources are awarded certification and gain a premium in electricity market trading.
While several countries in Europe and the United States have included nuclear power, a stable and reliable high-quality green and low-carbon electricity source, in the category of green electricity at the policy or implementation level, it has not yet been included in China's green certification and green electricity system, making it the only nonfossil energy source excluded from the system, he said.
Yang said the fact that nuclear power companies do not have access to official green electricity certification has prevented them from meeting the rising market demand for green electricity and has curbed the supply of green power.
""The inclusion of nuclear power in the green electricity trading system would not only benefit the environment but also develop a new form of productivity to support the nation's high-quality development,"" he said.
""It could also increase enthusiasm in purchasing nuclear power, enhancing the competitiveness of nuclear power in the electricity market while promoting the effective realization of the low-carbon value of nuclear power.""
According to CGN, the domestic and international carbon reduction situation has led to a continuous increase in demand for green electricity from various entities. If nuclear power was included, it could greatly alleviate the constraints placed on the supply of green electricity to society.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, electricity generated from nuclear power stations has the lowest carbon emissions among renewable energy sources, with one kWh of nuclear-generated electricity only emitting 5.7 grams of carbon emissions, compared with 74.6 grams from solar, 64.4 grams from hydropower and 13.3 grams from wind.
Lu Tiezhong, assistant general manager at China National Nuclear Corp and a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, also called for the inclusion of nuclear-generated electricity into the country's green electricity certification system.
While the scale of nuclear power in operation in China will soon be the largest in the world, and the nation has the foundation to lead the development of the global nuclear energy industry, the value of nuclear energy has not been recognized in current green electricity trading.
Accelerating the inclusion of nuclear energy will help promote China's transition to a green and low-carbon energy mix while supporting its high-quality development, he said.
According to the China Nuclear Energy Association, the total installed capacity of nuclear power generators in operation and under construction in China exceeds 100 million kilowatts, accounting for 21.2 percent of the world's total and has a first-rated safety record.
As of the end of last year, China had 55 nuclear power generators in operation, generating 4.86 percent of all power generated in the year, which helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 323.3 million metric tons, it said.
China is looking to develop its nuclear power sector as part of a broader push for renewables and domestic energy security. Nuclear is expected to contribute about 10 percent of power generation in the country by 2035 and 18 percent by 2060, with a total generation capacity of 400 gigawatts by 2060, the China Nuclear Energy Association said.

Researchers discover new cancer-fighting mechanism of blood cells,2024-03-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0310/c90000-20143200.html,"Home>>
		
Researchers discover new cancer-fighting mechanism of blood cells
 (Xinhua) 10:49, March 10, 2024
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have revealed the anti-tumor characteristic of neutrophils -- a type of white blood cells -- and the related molecular regulation mechanism, providing new insights into cancer diagnosis and treatment.
The discovery, made by researchers at the Shanghai Institute of Immunity and Infection under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Fudan University, was published in the journal Cell on Tuesday.
Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in a human body. As the first line of defence against bacterial and fungal infections, they play a key role in anti-infection immunity.
The researchers analyzed individual neutrophils from 143 patients with 17 different types of cancer, using cutting-edge single-cell RNA sequencing technology.
They revealed that neutrophils can adopt at least 10 highly specialized and distinct functional states related to inflammation, blood vessel formation, and -- most excitingly -- presenting antigens to activate potent cancer-killing T cells.
""We were surprised to find such intricate complexity and divergent roles embedded within neutrophils, which have been overlooked for so long as a simple population,"" said Zhang Xiaoming, a researcher at the institute.
""What is especially remarkable is their newly discovered capacity to act as antigen-presenting cells, maturing and rallying T cells against cancer. In addition, the abundance of antigen-presenting neutrophils is associated with improved patient prognosis across many tumor types revealed in this study,"" he said.
Through extensive analysis, the researchers determined that the antigen-presenting state can be switched on through metabolic signaling of the amino acid leucine and ensuing epigenetic changes.
""We've uncovered a way to wake up an untapped army already living within our immune system. Strategically activating these neutrophil states or modulating their behavior through metabolic or dietary means represents an entirely new paradigm to empower cancer immunotherapy,"" Zhang said.
The researchers then validated the therapeutic potential of these findings through vivo models. They found that delivering antigen-presenting neutrophils or simply modulating the leucine diet dramatically boosted the antitumor immune response in mice, and the treatments also markedly improved outcomes of PD-1 checkpoint immunotherapy across a range of cancer types.
""This completely changes how we perceive neutrophils in the context of cancer,"" said Gao Qiang, a professor at Fudan University. ""Now we know we could harness the diverse hidden identities of neutrophils to strengthen the effectiveness of immunotherapies. We're thrilled to further explore the potential benefits of these newly uncovered mechanisms in clinics.""
The study underscores the value of single-cell sequencing approaches to reveal new functional dimensions even within seemingly well-understood immune cells. Tapping into the hidden potential of neutrophils may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Scientists enhance weather forecasts reliability with machine learning,2024-03-09,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0309/c90000-20143062.html,"Home>>
		
Scientists enhance weather forecasts reliability with machine learning
 (Xinhua) 15:55, March 09, 2024
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A global team of researchers has made strides in refining weather forecasting methods using machine learning.
Scientists have been looking for better ways to make weather forecasts more accurate. Despite the maturity of ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP), the resulting forecasts are still, more often than not, under-dispersed. As such, forecast calibration tools have become popular.
Among those tools, quantile regression (QR) is highly competitive in terms of both flexibility and predictive performance. Nevertheless, a QR long-standing problem is quantile crossing, which greatly limits the interpretability of QR-calibrated forecasts.
On this point, this study proposes a non-crossing quantile regression neural network (NCQRNN), for calibrating ensemble NWP forecasts into a set of reliable quantile forecasts without crossing.
According to the study, the NCQRNN model modifies the traditional QRNN structure by adding a new layer that preserves the rank order of output nodes, such that the lower quantiles are constrained to be perpetually smaller than higher ones without losing accuracy.
""Our NCQRNN model maintains the natural order of forecast values, ensuring lower quantiles stay smaller than higher ones. This boosts accuracy and significantly improves forecast interpretability,"" said Yang Dazhi, a professor at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT).
The new findings, recently published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, was co-developed by researchers from the HIT, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, National University of Singapore, UK Power Networks, Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) in Hungary, and other institutes.
The researchers believe that this innovative machine learning approach has substantial improvements over existing models. Its adaptable design allows seamless integration into various weather forecasting systems, promising clearer and more reliable predictions for a range of weather variables.
""This non-crossing layer can be added to a wide range of different neural network structures, ensuring the wide applicability of the proposed technique,"" said Dr. Martin J. Mayer from the BME.
According to Dr. Sebastian Lerch from the KIT, the proposed neural network model for quantile regression is very general and can be applied to other target variables with minimal adaptations. Therefore, the method will also be of interest for other weather and climate applications beyond solar irradiance forecasting.
Moreover, the researchers emphasize that machine learning has important application prospects in the field of weather and climate research.
""This study provides an instructive case study on how to apply advanced machine learning methods to numerical weather prediction models to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and climate predictions,"" said Xia Xiang'ao, a professor from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the CAS.

BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently made strides in improving precipitation forecast using a novel approach that combines physics and artificial intelligence (AI).
The study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, was conducted by a research team led by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
According to the study, in the AI era, pure data-driven meteorological and climate models are gradually catching up with, and even surpassing, traditional numerical models. However, significant challenges persist in current deep learning models, which hinder the predictive capabilities for complex weather and climate phenomena, including precipitation.
The researchers proposed a new approach to address these challenges that involves combining physics, atmospheric dynamics, and deep learning models.
Leveraging EarthLab, a new Earth System Science Numerical Simulator Facility developed by the IAP, the team employed data and computational power to enhance numerical models' precipitation forecasting skills.
They focused on coupling physical variables through graph neural networks to introduce physical constraints and improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts.
In the AI era, the integration of physics is a major challenge with various approaches and perspectives, said Huang Gang, the corresponding author of the paper.
""Our team, drawing on atmospheric and climate dynamics considerations, has experimented with applying soft constraints to models from a physical coupling perspective,"" Huang added.

Sci-tech innovation, new growth engine for China
 (Xinhua) 09:52, March 08, 2024
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- As China pursues modernization through high-quality development, innovation driven by sci-tech progress has become a new growth engine for the country.
During the ongoing annual sessions of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), also known as the ""two sessions,"" the pivotal role of sci-tech innovation has been highlighted frequently.
The government work report, which was submitted Tuesday to the national legislature for deliberation, stressed the need to spur industrial innovation by making sci-tech innovations and press ahead with new industrialization, so as to raise total factor productivity, steadily foster new growth drivers and strengths, and promote a new leap forward in the productive forces.
""Sci-tech innovation plays a leading role in new quality productive forces, which meets the requirements of high-quality development"", said Guo Guoping, NPC deputy and chief scientist at Origin Quantum Computing Technology Co., Ltd.
""We can use quantum computing technology to achieve breakthroughs in traditional computing and applications in various industries to improve productivity, create more value and help promote economic development,"" said Guo, who is also a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China.
The company's quantum computing service covers finance, the chemical industry, biomedicine and the power industry. Its product Origin Wukong, China's independently developed third-generation superconducting quantum computer, has completed some 160,000 quantum computing tasks for global users since it became operational on Jan. 6 this year, with remote access exceeding 2 million times from more than 100 countries.
The cultivation of emerging industries and future-oriented industries such as hydrogen power, new materials, biomanufacturing, commercial spaceflight, quantum technology and life sciences is outlined in the government work report.
In some work reports of provincial-level regions released before the two sessions, emerging industries backed by sci-tech innovation are listed in the plans to drive economic growth.
For example, Tianjin will beef up sectors such as artificial intelligence and supercomputing, brain-computer interaction and human-machine integration, as well as universal robots. Henan will aim for expansion in the fields of commercial spaceflight, low-altitude economy, quantum technology and life sciences.
Innovation will not only improve productivity in emerging industries but also boost and transform the traditional sectors.
Chen Zhihua, chairman of Chinese software developer Kylinsoft, said that the operating system is the key basic software to support and guarantee the wide application of digital technology. The advancement of new quality productive forces requires higher performance of operating systems.
Chen, also a member of the CPPCC National Committee, added that the security and stability of the domestic operating system have achieved leapfrog development, which played an important role in the transformation and upgrading of operating systems in finance and key basic industries.
Tang Lixin, NPC deputy and chief scientist at a national science center of industrial intelligence in Northeastern University in Liaoning, said that future factories will be an integration of informatization, intelligence and automation.
By systematically integrating and analyzing industrial big data such as images, videos and visual simulations, enterprises can detect and diagnose product quality, equipment operation and maintenance, and production process under complex conditions, thus making targeted improvements to enhance quality and performance, Tang noted.
According to the 2024 draft plan for economic and social development of Liaoning, the heartland of heavy industry in the country, the province will build more than 500 provincial digitalized workshops and smart factories this year, and promote the construction of 5G-factories and pilot zones featuring ""5G plus industrial internet.""
Speaking to the press on the sidelines of the two sessions on Tuesday, Minister of Science and Technology Yin Hejun said that scientific and technological innovation not only enhances the competitiveness of the country's traditional industries but also lays a solid foundation and injects impetus into the development of new quality productive forces.
According to Yin, some 950,000 technology contracts were signed in 2023, with a total turnover of 6.15 trillion yuan (about 866 billion U.S. dollars), up 28.6 percent year on year. The number of authorized invention patents reached 921,000, an increase of 15.3 percent from the previous year.

China’s semiconductor export surges 28.6% in first two months, as efforts to shore up tech competitiveness pay off
 (Global Times) 15:16, March 07, 2024
China's integrated circuits (IC) or semiconductor chips export surged by nearly 30 percent in the first two months of 2024 amid the country's efforts to climb up the global technological ladder, despite mounting assaults by the US and its allies to slow down China's technology rise.
IC exports reached 160.71 billion yuan ($22.33 billion) during the first two months of 2024, with an annual increase of 28.6 percent, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Thursday.
IC exports were among a number of high-tech products that have experienced robust growth during the January-February period.
Beside IC, the exports of automatic data processing equipment increased by 7.3 percent year-on-year to reach 195.45 billion yuan and auto exports soared by 15.8 percent from the same period last year to reach 111.89 billion yuan.
The robust growth of high-tech products reflect that China's efforts in transforming and upgrading its industries is paying off , and the tech suppression by a number of Western countries have largely failed and have actually boosted China's tech competitiveness as the country put more efforts in achieving self-sufficiency in high-tech products such as chips, analysts said.
China's chip self-sufficiency rate may increase to 30-35 percent as many domestic chipmakers have expanded manufacturing since the US launched its tech war against China several years ago, said Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance.
Zheng Shanjie, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner, said at a press conference held during the ongoing two sessions that China's economy was off to a good start in the first quarter this year, with preliminary economic indicators such as electricity use, exports, and bank loans pointing to a strong recovery of the economy.
