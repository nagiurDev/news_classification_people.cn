China's largest general-purpose precision survey telescope to be based in Qinghai
 (Global Times) 14:38, May 27, 2024
China's largest general-purpose precision survey telescope is expected to be based in Lenghu town, Northwest China's Qinghai Province, after a cooperation agreement was signed on Sunday between the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the government of the Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai.
The 4.2-meter diameter ground-based specialized astrometric telescope is optimally designed for high-precision astrometric measurements of solar system objects, with an investment of about 300 million yuan ($41 million), Ping Yiding, a senior engineer at the PMO explained, as reported by China News Service.
It will be the largest general-purpose precision survey telescope in China and the largest specialized telescope for astrometric measurements in the world after its completion, serving a range of all kinds of astronomical science objectives, Ping said.
The Lenghu astronomical observation base, located in Saishiteng Mountain, Lenghu town, sits at an average altitude of about 4,000 meters. After a number of preliminary monitoring and analyses, the Chinese and foreign astronomical communities unanimously agreed that the region has unique advantages for astronomical observation and research in terms of geographical location, climate, air cleanliness, and altitude. It also fully meets the demand for scientific research on optical and infrared macro-astronomical equipment, according to the report.
The selected site will end a bottleneck that has long constrained the development of optical astronomical observation in China, and fill the gap of world-class optical astronomical observatory sites in the Eastern Hemisphere. It also provides extremely valuable strategic and scarce resources for the formation of a complete time and space observation network on a global scale and for the promotion of the development of international optical astronomy.
The PMO and the autonomous prefecture government on Sunday also signed a cooperation agreement on the 2.5-meter diameter multi-terminal universal telescope project, according to the same report.

Hefei, the provincial capital city of East China's Anhui Province, in many aspects is similar to other rapidly developing cities in China. Known for tall buildings and plush office towers, outside a street is nicknamed ""Quantum Boulevard,"" home to a number of cutting-edge technology firms.
Propelled by the local government and companies, the city has attracted global attention in recent years, with some even attributing much of the city's achievement to the ""Hefei model"", a distinctive strategy for nurturing emerging industries by effectively combining the roles of state-owned capital and private enterprises.
Official data showed that Hefei's GDP has risen to 1.27 trillion yuan ($175 billion) in 2023, up from 416.8 billion yuan in 2012, and its ranking among Chinese mainland cities rose to the 20th from the 31st, a truly ""dark horse"" if calculated by its GDP growth.
Market insiders and Chinese experts attributed Hefei's development to the tech cluster of pillar industries including NEVs, chips, and AI innovation, as well as new industries including quantum technology. The city, serving as an example of national model of excellence in the realm of new productivity, is in line with the Chinese government's plans to promote new quality productive forces.
Industry clusters
Kong Wansheng, vice president of Hefei-based Guochuang Software Co, still remembers clearly how difficult when he wanted to apply for a telephone for his family in 2000. He had to ask someone to help him get through to it, and had to wait for one month before being hooked up to the mobile network.
The year of 2000 marked the beginning of Guochuang's business in Hefei, when China's telecommunications industry took off. From a school-run enterprise to a Shenzhen stock market listed company, Guochuang primarily engaged in data intelligence products by integrating software and hardware.
Now, any individual can go straight to a shopping mall and get connected to the mobile network in a few minutes, Kong told the Global Times, adding that the reason behind the progress is the deep integration of information technology with telecommunications. In 2023, the revenues reached 251 million yuan ($35.3 million), a growth of 4.78 percent year-on-year, the company said.
""Our company's expansion has been catching up with the pace of China's economic development, and the strategy of developing new quality productive forces has given us more room for further development,"" Kong said.
The telecommunications industry is only part of the clusters that Hefei is proud of. Other industries including integrated circuits, quantum computing and artificial intelligence are also listed as the city's pillar industries to drive the city's tech progress.
Across the Hefei Advanced Computing Center of Hefei High-tech Zone, there is a blue glass cube covering a length, width and height of more than 10 meters, named ""Chaohu Mingyue"" supercomputer. Inside it, a giant computer screen occupies 225 square meters on the upper and lower floors. Through the glass, a Global Times reporter saw that the entire giant computer was immersed in a transparent liquid.
""The computers will generate a lot of heat in operation, and the server's operating functions will be affected when the temperature rises, so we designed this electronic fluorinated liquid with a lower boiling point to achieve physical cooling, according to Han Shengjun, vice general manager of Hefei Big Data Asset Operation Co.
If the 1.4 billion people in China are asked to calculate 100 days at a rate of once per second 24 hours a day, ""Chaohu Mingyue"" supercomputer is able to do it in less than one second.
The giant computer can simultaneously process 3 billion image data, 900,000 hours of voice translation, and 3,000 km of autonomous driving data. Its storage capacity is equivalent to the storage capacity of 120,000 128G mobile phones, and can store approximately 10 billion high-definition pictures, according to Han.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang on May 10 stressed accelerating the development of new quality productive forces and improving innovation-driven development capabilities.
During his inspection tour in Anhui Province, Li said that China will increase investment in basic research to support tech innovation. Noting the vitality of science and technology lies in its utilization and benefiting humankind, Li urged for deepening reforms to promote the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into real productive forces.

Innovation-driven growth
In the high-tech industrial zone in Hefei, dozens of quantum industry chain companies including quantum communication, quantum computing and quantum precision measurement are scattered on both sides of Yunfei Road, known locally as ""Quantum Boulevard"".
""Developing new quality productive forces will be a decisive step in the economy's high-quality development,"" Guo Guoping, deputy director of the Key Laboratory of Quantum Information of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times.
It has been four months since China's indigenous third-generation superconducting quantum computer, Origin Wukong, became operational. To date, the computer has completed 178,000 computing tasks for users in 120 countries and regions.
According to Guo, quantum computing power can be applied to finance, chemical industry, biomedicine, electricity and other fields.
Official data showed that the output value of Hefei's strategic emerging industries has grown at an average annual rate of 17.1 percent in the past decade, the proportion of industries above designated size has increased from 30.2 percent to 54.7 percent, and the contribution rate to industrial growth has increased from 69.9 percent to 84.1 percent.
In 2023, the output value of the city's strategic emerging industries increased by 11.1 percent year-on-year, accounting for 54.7 percent of the proportion of designated industries. The number of companies with more than 10 billion yuan's industrial output hit 25, including BYD and iFlytek.
As China advances toward modernization through high-quality development, innovation fueled by scientific and technological innovation has emerged as a driving force of economic growth.
Grand Union of Innovation, a platform set up in June of 2020 aiming to incubate innovative enterprises and promote the commercialization of innovations has attracted 43 percent of Hefei's quantum companies, 50 percent of its synthetic biology companies, and 55 percent of the aerospace information companies in Hefei.
""The platform is an incubator focusing on early-stage, small, technology-based companies, and with the help of government funding, technology and talent, we are building an ecosystem conducive to innovation and corporate growth,"" Wu Hailong, chairman of Grand Union of Innovation, told the Global Times.
Core technologies and key modules are being developed by National Intelligent Voice Innovation Center.
Driven by companies such as iFlytek, Cambricon Technologies and Tongfang, the voice innovation center has built 18 platforms, ranging from industrial platforms serving the development of small and medium-sized enterprises to open voice platforms with core technologies and brain-like intelligence, forming an artificial intelligence industry chain that also serves as the CPU, storage, and basic software in various fields.
""The companies in voice innovation center are a perfect match to build an efficient and collaborative industrial chain, said Wu Jiangzhao, general manager of the National Intelligent Voice Innovation Center.
For example, in the field of artificial intelligence, Cambricon Technologies and other companies focused on AI chips to provide hardware support for intelligent computing, and iFlytek is engaged in speech recognition, and the center is promoting the development of smart home appliances in a more intelligent direction, Wu said.

Global recognition
The Government Work Report released at the two sessions in March this year stressed the need to spur industrial innovation by making sci-tech innovations and press ahead with new industrialization, so as to raise total factor productivity, steadily foster new growth drivers and strengths, and promote a new leap forward in the productive forces, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
Emerging industries supported by tech innovation were included in many provinces' plan to stimulate economic growth.
For example, Hunan Province plans to vigorously develop industries such as quantum information, bio-medicine, brain science and brain-inspired research, and liquid metal, and Guangdong Province will focus on expanding industries such as future electronic information, future smart equipment and future materials.
Chinese policymakers emphasize that scientific and technological innovation is the core element for developing new quality productive forces. They call for the whole of society to work harder on promoting industrial innovation through technological innovation, proactively align with the force of national strategic science and technology, and produce first-class research and development institutions both at home and abroad, so as to boost the country's own innovation capacity in key areas.
Hefei's rapid development has attracted global attention. The New York Times highlighted the ""Hefei model"", writing that Hefei's industrial policies have been so successful in nurturing technology companies that China's central government has embraced tenets of what is known as the ""Hefei model.""
The Hefei model consists of using government money to buy newly issued shares in manufacturers and start-ups that need cash. Officials also arrange loans with attractive interest rates from commercial banks to finance new factories, according to the New York Times.
A distinctive feature of the Hefei model is that the government invests through industrial funds and other means to guide the direction of industrial development, while fully leveraging the role of market mechanism to attract high-quality enterprises. This combination enables Hefei to quickly respond to market changes and promote the formation of industrial clusters, Wang Peng, an associate researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.
These new quality productive forces are characterized by new technologies and new applications, and are inseparable from tech innovation. It can be said that Hefei has built a unique innovation ecosystem, and has accumulated solid experience. To a certain extent, Hefei's innovation, openness and tolerance represent China's high-quality development, Wang said.
China's industrial output significantly boosted the economy in the first quarter of 2024, with value-added industrial output up 6.1 percent year-on-year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.
Experts said that improving market demand, macroeconomic policy support and operating conditions are all playing a role. The impact of advanced manufacturing is particularly prominent, driving improvements in both the quality and quantity of industrial output.
""The road of developing new quality productive forces should be fostered in technology enhancement and industry planning,"" Zhu Siqiao, an associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times.
China should promote technological transformation, upgrade traditional industries, and cultivate strategic emerging industries, future industries and green industries, Zhu added.
Through high-tech industrialization, Hefei is actively promoting the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into real productivity and injecting new momentum into regional development.
""China's high-growth development has been unbroken for many years, and its scale has covered many industrial categories. In some fields, we have achieved global leadership. We have entered a new stage and have requirement for higher quality of development, said Kong from Guochuang Software Co.
""In my view, the integration of technological innovation and massive businesses still has a lot of room for development in China,"" Kong said.

BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has unveiled the continuous evolutionary history of rice, tracing its journey from wild to domesticated over an astounding period of 100,000 years.
The findings published on Friday in the journal Science not only shed new light on the progression of human society and the origins of agricultural civilization, but also present compelling evidence that China is the birthplace of rice.
The cultivation and domestication of rice, a dietary staple for billions worldwide, have exerted a significant influence on the evolution of Chinese civilization.
Scholars from various academic fields have long been captivated by the study of how humans first began cultivating wild rice and the evolutionary journey from wild to cultivated strains.
Archaeological findings of rice at sites like Hemudu and Shangshan in the Yangtze River's middle and lower valleys since the 1970s have shed light on the region's pivotal role as a cradle for rice cultivation.
However, identifying well-preserved markers that differentiate wild from cultivated rice in the region, dating back to the last glacial maximum, and elucidating the mechanisms and processes behind early human exploitation, cultivation and domestication of wild rice, continued to be central challenges in archaeological research.
The research team that led by Professor Lyu Houyuan from the Institute of Geology and Geophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a systematic study on phytoliths in modern wild and domesticated rice plants and soils.
They found that the increase in the number of fish-scale facets on the bulliform phytoliths correlates with the trait of domestication. Based on these findings, they developed a standard for distinguishing wild rice from its domesticated counterparts.
Employing this benchmark, the research group delved into the archaeological layers and natural profiles of the Shangshan site and the Hehuashan site in east China's Zhejiang Province.
The analysis revealed a continuous trajectory of rice from wild to domesticated within the layer of Shangshan cultural site and its relationship with human activities and climate change.
Wild rice was already prevalent in the lower Yangtze River region approximately 100,000 years ago, laying the groundwork for the subsequent utilization and domestication of rice, according to the study.
Approximately 24,000 years ago, coinciding with the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum, human ancestors began gathering and utilizing wild rice. This adaptation allowed them to seek new sources of food amidst the challenges posed by the cooling climate.
About 13,000 years ago, they embarked on the practice of rice cultivation. By approximately 11,000 years ago, there was a rapid rise in the prevalence of phytoliths characteristic of domesticated rice, which surpassed the threshold indicative of domestication.
""Our research uncovered that the inception of rice agriculture in East Asia and wheat agriculture in the Southwest Asia transpired concurrently,"" said Prof. Zhang Jianping from the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, one of the corresponding authors of the study.
""It represents a significant milestone in the history of human development and has greatly deepened our understanding of the global origins of agriculture,"" said Zhang.
Also, the 100,000-year-long record of wild rice distribution, culminating in its domestication at the Shangshan cultural site, reveals the intricate interplay among rice, climate, human practices and cultural evolution, according to Zhang.
This innovative discovery significantly impacts our understanding of human-rice co-evolution, human societal development, the origins of agricultural civilization and the importance of Shangshan culture, commented the peer reviewer of the study.

A Chinese university has developed a type of electronic ""skin"" for robots that can function in temperatures as low as -78 C, a breakthrough that could support China's polar research and facilitate scientific activities in extreme environments.
This new material can be wrapped around a robot's palms. It provides tactile sensation and gives robotic hands high self-healing ability and high sensitivity.
It can accurately sense pressure and identify the shape of items and special symbols, according to a statement sent by Tianjin University to the Global Times on Thursday.
""This technological breakthrough will help robots overcome the challenges of extremely low temperatures, which pose a major issue for their use in polar regions,"" Liu Tingting, a research fellow at the Wuhan University Chinese Antarctic Center of Surveying and Mapping, told the Global Times on Thursday.
The material can ensure the proper functioning of robot bodies and their batteries in harsh environments such as those found in polar regions, Liu added.
The complex glacial terrain and harsh weather conditions in Antarctica pose significant challenges for researchers. China's ongoing exploration and application of high-tech materials are helping address these tough tasks in polar-related research.
Multiple technologies have been applied to assist China's polar exploration. For instance, according to the Wuhan University Chinese Antarctic Center of Surveying and Mapping, the development and application of drone technology gave significant support to China's Antarctic inland expeditions in April, particularly in surveying terrain and land surface coverage.
Liu said that such breakthroughs could help solve challenges faced in China's research in polar regions, such as carrying out tasks that are unsuitable for humans and in areas that are too dangerous to reach.
Yang Jing, one of the professors at Tianjin University who lead the research team, was quoted as saying in the statement that the team created a world-leading self-healing electronic material as early as 2020.
The electronic ''skin'' represents a further breakthrough in the technology, and it is expected to have broad applications in polar research and beyond.

Guangdong province in south China has been accelerating the digital, networked and intelligent development of the manufacturing sector in recent years, leveraging technological transformation to upgrade traditional manufacturing industries such as textile and home appliance.
As a major production base of the textile and garment industry, Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province has encouraged a number of industrial internet platforms to help small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) transition to cloud-based systems and services, including Guangzhou Zhijing Information Technology Co., Ltd. (GZIT), a Guangzhou-based company that uses digital technologies to streamline textile operations.
The company has developed an intelligent platform that assists garment manufacturers find proper fabric suppliers. The platform gathers massive market information and can quickly search for desired items based on actual demands.
Shi Daqing, general manager of a garment company in Dongguan, Guangdong province, is a beneficiary of the platform. ""In the past, I had to search in fabric markets for days every time I came to Guangzhou to procure supplies. Now, with online fabric selection, it only takes a few minutes to find the fabrics we want,"" said Shi, who has been engaged in the garment business for more than 20 years.
According to Li Yaping, co-founder and senior vice president of GZIT, the company, leveraging big data, Internet of Things and other cutting-edge technologies, has launched multiple smart cloud platforms that cover all sectors of the garment industrial chain, from fabric production to procurement, and from apparel design to sales.
Li told People's Daily that it generally cost over half a month to design a piece of clothing in the past, which needed multiple procedures such as graphic design, pattern making, cutting and sample making.

However, the cycle has been shortened to just minutes thanks to an intelligent apparel design platform independently developed by GZIT, which can rapidly generate virtual samples based on preset styles and preferences.
In a smart textile park of GZIT in Yibin, southwest China's Sichuan province, the company employs a real-time intelligent quality-check system.
Many defects of fabrics couldn't be spotted by manual inspections, and now with the fully automated quality-check system, over 99 percent of the products are qualified, said Li Peifeng, head of the smart textile park.
""Each roll of the fabrics comes with a quality-check report and a QR code, which enable full traceability of production information along the chain,"" he told People's Daily.
Since its establishment in 2014, GZIT has continually expanded its business scope, serving more than 50,000 enterprises in the textile and apparel industry both inside and outside Guangdong province with digital technologies.
""Cloud"" services give a big helping hand to SMEs, which is deeply recognized by Chen Kai, general manager of a textile company in Foshan, Guangdong province.

""We all know the benefits of digitalization, but everything about it, from R&D to equipment upgrade, costs money. Cloud services allow us small businesses to achieve significant outcomes with minimal investment,"" Chen noted.
Today, Chen's company can pay to use GZIT's intelligent systems and enjoy tangible benefits of technological transformation. ""The systems monitor equipment operation in real time, reducing abnormal downtime by 35 percent and boosting overall efficiency by 30 percent,"" Chen said.
As more and more companies adopted its services in recent years, GZIT built a cloud platform that coordinates upstream and downstream production.
""Downstream apparel manufacturers place orders, the platform assigns them, and upstream textile firms take them,"" said Li. ""Through cloud-based management, we can rapidly match demands and supplies, thus promoting efficient production.""
Li is quite optimistic about GZIT's future development. ""Apart from servicing upstream and downstream enterprises, we are now integrating them to make the industrial chain more resilient and competitive!""
Zou Yongbing, chief economist of the Department of Industry and Information Technology of Guangdong province, said that in recent years, the province has introduced and cultivated over 400 outstanding industrial internet platform companies and service providers including GZIT. Collectively, they have driven digital transformation for over 30,000 industrial enterprises above designated size and enabled over 750,000 SMEs to adopt cloud solutions.

Researchers refine their understanding of ice surface premelting,2024-05-23,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0523/c90000-20173200.html,"Home>>
		
Researchers refine their understanding of ice surface premelting
 (Xinhua) 11:22, May 23, 2024
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese researchers has observed the atomic resolution image of an ice surface and discovered that the ice surface begins to melt at minus 153 degrees Celsius, according to a research article published in journal Nature on Wednesday.
Ice surface is an important medium for a variety of natural phenomena and atmospheric reactions, which has significant effects on ice formation, stratospheric ozone depletion and the electrification of thunderclouds.
Previously, the understanding of the ice surface was limited due to a lack of experimental methods at the atomic scale.
The researchers from the School of Physics of Peking University and Interdisciplinary Institute of Light-Element Quantum Materials used the domestic qPlus scanning probe microscope to develop an imaging technique that can distinguish hydrogen atoms and chemical bonds, accurately recognize the orientation of water molecules and precisely locate the distribution of dangling hydrogen atoms.
The surface of ice often begins to melt at temperatures below zero degrees Celsius, a phenomenon known as ice premelting, which is crucial to understanding the cloud formation and the melting of glaciers.
It was commonly believed that the starting point for ice surface premelting was about minus 70 degrees Celsius. The debate over ice surface structure and premelting mechanisms has persisted for more than 170 years.
With the help of temperature change experiments, the researchers observed the premelting process on the surface of ice at the atomic scale and discovered that the process begins at minus 153 degrees Celsius.
The study refined the long-standing knowledge of ice surface structure and its premelting mechanism, said Wang Enge, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

""China's version of Neuralink unveiled"" - that's how observers described Neucyber, an invasive implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, independently developed by Chinese scientists.
In its latest public appearance in April, through Neucyber, a monkey with its hands tied up can control a robotic arm with ""just its thoughts"" and successfully grasp a strawberry.
Recently, the Global Times visited the Chinese Institute for Brain Research in Beijing to witness the magical scene.
The wired Neucyber linking the monkey's brain is a system composed of three core components — high-throughput flexible microelectrodes, two high-speed neural signal acquisition devices and a generative neural decoding algorithm. It is able to capture subtle changes in the monkey's brain's electrical signals, decode the brain's intentions and achieve ""thought"" control of ""actions.""
The waving electrical signals on the screen are collected by the Neucyber, near the neurons of the monkey's brain, Zhang Lei, director of Instrumentation Core from the institute told the Global Times, pointing to the robust signals.
The flexible electrode has been stably implanted in the monkey's skull for nearly a year, and is still able to collect high-quality signals.
Following capturing signals, Neucyber will then decode the message with a decoding algorithm called ""feedforward generative neural decoding algorithm,"" allowing the monkey to predict the moving target and control the robotic arm, Zhang said.
The advanced algorithm is a step forward to achieve the goal of creating neurally controlled prosthetics that are more human-like, natural and flexible for patients in the future. The team revealed that researchers are about to publish academic papers on the advanced algorithm-powered Neucyber.
Neuralink has already implanted its wireless brain chips in humans, while China has yet to begin human trials.
The Global Times learned that Chinese Institute for Brain Research is working on altering the wired BCI system into a fully implanted wireless invasive device, striving to start human trials next year.
Zhang said ""While Elon Musk's startup Neuralink is considered the leading wireless BCI technology in practical use, our algorithm and electrodes are just as capable. However, the challenge lies in integrating the device into a small, discreet device that is safe for brains.""
'Talk less, do more' 
BCI technology is increasingly coming into view of the public, largely due to Elon Musk's Neuralink breakthrough. However, the roots of this technology actually trace back 50 years. The current top BCI technology in the world can decode 60 to 90 words per minute using brain signals, aiding high-level paraplegic patients in regaining mobility.
While China's BCI technology generally lags behind leading countries like the US in terms of system integration and clinical application, this has not hindered the release of Neucyber, which stands as China's first ""high-performance invasive BCI.""
The breakthrough lies in the efforts of the institute gathering superior resources from various teams in Beijing, Li Yuan, Business Development Director of Beijing Xinzhida Neurotechnology, the company that co-developed this BCI system, told the Global Times.
Developing the entire Neucyber system only took a year. Li explained that building the systematic project was possible because of a group of matured talents was gathered within the institute, from specific fields involving electrodes, chips, algorithms, software and materials.
In addition, the release of Neucyber is in line with China's overall strategy to develop BCI technology. Media reports have shown that China's supporting BCI technology has been clearly written within the national ""14th Five-Year Plan"" in 2020. The country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last year also classified BCI technology as an important ""cutting-edge emerging technology.""
To integrate the Neucyber into a small gadget like Neuralink, Li said multiple factors such as power supply, signal communication, power consumption, heat generation and size limitations should be taken into consideration.
""We do not want to be imaginative and talk too much, but strive to take out a set of products step by step that can be useful in actual application,"" Li told the Global Times.
Industry observers believe that since the BCI technology has not yet been widely used as medical devices globally, China still has the chance to industrialize its BCI products before the US.
In the application prospects, BCI devices are widely seen to be used in myoelectric prostheses which allow amputees to move more naturally and it is also expected to be used to treat neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and stroke sequelae.
Furthermore, through wireless brain interfaces, small white rats and cockroaches can be controlled by animals with strong survivability in harsh environments, allowing them to help humans complete some special tasks, such as environmental monitoring and post-disaster rescue, Ye Zhewei, chairman of Intelligent Medicine Branch of Wuhan Medical Association was quoted by Changjiang Daily.
Producing dopamine and nerve cells is stimulated in neurological diseases such as depression and epilepsy. Soon, diseases such as epilepsy will be likely to be handled with more effective treatment, according to Ye.
Previously, China's prestigious Tsinghua University announced that Chinese scientists had made a breakthrough in the world's first patient BCI rehabilitation trial. The BCI technology device NEO (Neural Electronic Opportunity) was successfully implanted into a patient's brain for the BCI-assisted treatment trial at the Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing, on October 24, 2023.
China has also achieved a technological breakthrough in the chip flux of BCI. For example, Wuhan Zhonghua Brain-Computer Integration Technology Development successfully developed 65,000 two-way BCI chips, ranking at the international leading level, Ye said.
The development prospects of sensors, wireless transmission methods and chip functions are also very huge in China, Ye noted, which is the confidence of China to further advance the BCI technology.

A new joint study conducted by researchers from China, the UK, Canada, Switzerland and Germany has found that the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) is increasing due to global warming. The study was published in Nature Reviews Earth &Environment on Tuesday.
Against the backdrop of global warming, glaciers are melting and retreating. When glacier meltwater is blocked by glaciers, ice moraine, or bedrock, ice lakes form in front of the ice, on the ice edge, on the ice surface, within the ice, or under the ice. Ice lakes may trigger GLOFs, according to Zhang Guoqing, a researcher from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a co-author of the study.
Conducting a comprehensive study of the global distribution, formation time, evolution process, and physical characteristics of ice lakes is crucial for mitigating the damage caused by GLOFs in downstream areas, Zhang noted.
Previous ice lake studies have been more singular, focusing on specific types of ice lakes or specific mountain areas. There has been a lack of global systematic study of the characteristics and changes of ice lakes and GLOFs, according to Zhang.
In the study, researchers synthesized global changes in glacial lakes and GLOFs. More than 110,000 glacial lakes currently exist, covering a total area of around 15,000 square kilometers. This area has increased roughly 22 percent per decade from 1990 to 2020. More than 10 million people are exposed to the impacts of GLOFs, which are also associated with dam failure, according to the article.
Ongoing deglaciation and lake expansion are expected to increase the frequency of GLOFs, according to the article.
There are big regional differences, the researchers concluded. In high mountain areas of Asia, GLOF hazards are projected to triple by 2100, but the potential risk in the Western European Alps and Cordillera Blanca Mountains in Peru is relatively low. Iceland may experience volcanic activity in the future, leading to large-scale GLOFs, the report said.
The report called for future research to prioritize acquiring field data on lake and dam properties, as well as globally coordinated multi-temporal lake mapping, and robust and efficient modeling of GLOFs for comprehensive hazard assessment and response planning.

Chinese scientists succeed in speed rice breeding in desert greenhouses
By Jiang Jianke (People's Daily) 13:10, May 22, 2024
A group of scientists from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) recently announced the success of a trial planting to halve the growth cycle of a conventional rice variety in a desert greenhouse in Hotan, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
""We started the breeding in February this year. Supported by soilless farming, it took just 60 days for the rice seedlings to harvest,"" said Wang Sen, a researcher with the CAAS's Institute of Urban Agriculture (IUA).

China is the first country in the world to cultivate rice. With ordinary farming practices, it usually takes 120 to 150 days on average for rice to mature in China's major rice-growing areas.
Why can the growth cycle of rice be significantly reduced in desert greenhouses of Hotan?
In 2021, Yang Qichang, chief scientist with the IUA, and his team successfully cut the growth cycle of rice by half in a plant factory in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan province. They also achieved a technological breakthrough that allows rice to be cultivated throughout the year, without being limited by seasonal factors.
Yang noted that cultivating rice in a plant factory is costly, adding that he and his team hoped to explore a technical approach that could achieve speed breeding while also significantly reducing costs.
""We found that Hotan is an ideal place for building greenhouses because the land and operating costs are relatively low here with its vast deserts, abundant sunlight and heat resources. Implementing speed breeding here can significantly reduce costs,"" Yang explained.

In the greenhouses of Hotan, Yang and his team replaced soil cultivation with nutrient solutions and employed multi-spectrum LED light sources and environmental control technologies to regulate the lighting and temperature conditions. After more than two years of experiments, the team finally achieved speed rice breeding in desert greenhouses.
Later, Yang and his team continued to explore key technologies for the fast breeding of other crops in desert greenhouses, including soybeans, corn, wheat, oilseed crops and cotton.
The successful trial planting demonstrated that speed breeding in desert greenhouses is entirely feasible and provides an effective method to produce more generations of rice each year, Yang said. Besides, the efficacy of low-cost, highly efficient and energy-saving gutter-connected desert greenhouses has also been validated, he added.
After future integration with new energy and other technologies, construction and operating costs will be greatly reduced, which will make such greenhouses strongly competitive globally, Yang told People's Daily.
