Chinese scientists propose new way for tumor targeting
 (Xinhua) 15:42, December 16, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from China have developed a method for constructing sequence-controlled glycooligomers that enhances the tumor targeting efficiency.
The study was published on Friday in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science by researchers from Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Henan University and other institutes.
According to the study, cancers of diverse origins exhibit more rapid and greater carbohydrate uptake and consumption compared to healthy cells. This is primarily due to factors like the Warburg effect and the high expression of glucose transporters on the surface of cancer cells, making carbohydrate efficient tools for targeting cancer. Therefore, focusing on carbohydrates offers a viable approach for selective treatment and diagnosis of cancer.
The researchers have found the synthesized glycooligomers feature affinity for binding with glucose transporters and demonstrate selective uptake by cancer cells, showing effective tumor-targeting abilities in vivo.
According to the study, the uptake of the synthesized glycooligomers by cancerous cells is found to be significantly higher than that in most healthy cells.
The study then further explored the tumor-targeting potential of the glycooligomers with optimized sequences.
""The method of constructing glycooligomers holds significant promise for biomedical uses, including precise cancer detection and treatment,"" said Geng Jin, a researcher at SIAT.

Chinese scientists design solar-powered temperature regulating clothes
 (Xinhua) 10:22, December 16, 2023
TIANJIN, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has designed a flexible, self-sustaining solar-powered clothing system that allows the human body to remain within a comfortable temperature range despite fluctuating environmental temperatures.
The clothing system, powered by a flexible solar cell, requires no external energy source except sunlight, according to the study published on Friday in the journal Science.
Unlike previous thermo-regulatory clothing, the wearable platform, developed by the researchers from Nankai University, is capable of both warming up and cooling down, thanks to an electrical device that can realize two-way temperature adjustment all through the day.
The highly efficient device allows for 24-hour controllable temperature regulation with just 12 hours of sunlight energy input, according to the study.
It works to maintain the human skin temperature within a thermal comfort zone of between 32 and 36 Celsius degrees, despite variation in the environmental temperature of between 12.5 and 37.6 Celsius degrees, the study shows.
The new device could help improve the safety and comfort of the human body amid fluctuating environmental temperatures and even extend survivability in extreme environments, like those in outer space or on other planets, the researchers said.

Scientists identify new method of extracting chemicals from wastewater
 (Xinhua) 15:57, December 15, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have proposed a new method of transforming wastewater contaminants into valuable chemicals using sunlight, paving the way for sustainable and eco-friendly chemical manufacturing.
The study, conducted by researchers from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin Institute of Technology and other institutes, was recently published in the journal Nature Sustainability.
In this study, the researchers set out to convert pollutants from wastewater into semiconductor biohybrids directly in the wastewater environment.
The concept involves utilizing the organic carbon, heavy metals and sulfate compounds present in wastewater as the raw materials for constructing these biohybrids, and subsequently converting them into valuable chemicals using sunlight.
The researchers selected a fast-growing marine bacterium, Vibrio natriegens, which has exceptional tolerance for high salt concentrations and a capacity for utilizing various carbon sources.
They introduced an aerobic sulfate reduction pathway into Vibrio natriegens in order to biosynthesize functional semiconductor nanoparticles in Vibrio natriegens to assemble semiconductor biohybrids from wastewater.
The nanoparticles can increase the synthesis efficiency of biohybrids and the conversion of organic matter in wastewater by absorbing the extra energy generated by sunlight, said Gao Xiang, a researcher at the SIAT.
""This work can bring solar-driven biomanufacturing and waste-to-wealth conversion one step forward and pave the way to cleaner production and circular economy,"" said the study.

The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) announced on Thursday the global opening of the next generation artificial sun, “China Circulation-3,” after the group’s affiliated Southwestern Institute of Physics signed an agreement with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The initiative invites scientists worldwide to come to China and collaborate toward the shared goal of pursuing “artificial sun energy.”
The “China Circulation-3” is currently China's most advanced and largest-scale nuclear fusion device, also referred to as China's next generation “artificial sun.”
In August this year, it successfully achieved high-constraint operation mode under a plasma current of 1 million amperes, marking a significant advancement in China's magnetic confinement nuclear fusion device, propelling it to the forefront of international research.
Over the years, the Southwestern Institute of Physics has been deeply involved in the development of key components for ITER, the world's largest “artificial sun” project, CNNC said, and together overcame numerous engineering and technical challenges.
This involvement of the Chinese institute has led to the accumulation of extensive experience in the construction, debugging, operation, and maintenance of fusion devices, laying a solid foundation for China to integrate with international advanced technology and eventually construct its own fusion reactor.
Due to the similarity in the principles of the two experiments, the openness of “China Circulation-3” will not only focus on addressing key technical issues of interest to the ITER but will also enhance China's research and development capabilities and foster talent development.
In April this year, the other Chinese ""artificial sun,” the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST), which is also the world's first fully superconducting tokamak device in operation, saw a major breakthrough as it achieved a high power, stable, 403-second steady-state long-pulse high confinement mode plasma operation, setting a new world record for steady-state high confinement mode operation of a tokamak device.
Developer of the EAST, the Institute of Plasma Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that they are aiming to use the EAST to generate fusion power before the centenary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which falls in 2049.

"Ancient Tibetans crossbreed yak, cattle 2,500 years ago: study",2023-12-15,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1215/c90000-20111035.html,"Home>>
		
Ancient Tibetans crossbreed yak, cattle 2,500 years ago: study
 (Xinhua) 14:35, December 15, 2023
CHENGDU, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- A new archaeological study has shown that inhabitants of the southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau engaged in crossbreeding of yak and cattle in the high-altitude region at least 2,500 years ago.
This practice of crossbreeding domestic yak with cattle is known to produce hybrids that combine yaks' endurance in harsh environments with the meat and milk-producing capabilities of cattle.
Researchers from Sichuan University, Northwest A&F University and Washington University in St. Louis collected and analyzed the remains of 193 yaks, cattle, and their hybrids obtained from excavations at the Bangga site in Shannan, dating back between around 2,700 and 2,350 years ago.
Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 10,000 mammals, dating back to the period between 3,000 and 2,200 years ago, from the Bangga site. Bangga is a large-scale and complex prehistoric stone building compound located about 3,750 meters above sea level.
Genetic studies revealed that the cattle in the Bangga site had about 12 to 20 percent genetic similarity with domestic yak, while the ancestry of yaks now living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is influenced by ancient cattle.
The genetic exchange indicates that ancient Tibetans had already exploited the advantages of yak-cattle hybridization at that time, according to the study published on Thursday in the journal Science Advances.
Also, the cattle DNA from Bangga resembled that of older, lower-altitude taurine cattle from northwestern China, suggesting that taurine cattle were likely brought to the Bangga region from northwestern China, according to the researchers.
The livestock production, as well as the cultivation of barley and wheat at the Bangga site, indicate that a diversified lifestyle integrating agriculture with animal husbandry in the southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau had taken shape about 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, according to the study.

BEIJING, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Long March family of Chinese launch vehicles marked a 500th spaceflight on Sunday by launching a Long March-2D carrier rocket to send a remote sensing satellite to space from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan Province in the southwest of China.
In addition to the Long March family, China is also witnessing the boom of a commercial space industry. Many private space startups are busy creating and testing reusable rockets, sending payloads into orbit and aiming to catch up with world-leading peers in the industry.
SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES
China's commercial space industry has achieved notable breakthroughs in 2023 with a series of successful rocket launches completed.
One of these happened this past Sunday at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, where a Chinese commercial reusable rocket named SQX-2Y successfully completed its second flight test mission, the first reuse of such a rocket in China.
The rocket, propelled by a liquid oxygen methane engine, was developed by Beijing Interstellar Glory Space Technology Ltd., better known as iSpace. It also successfully completed a vertical take-off and landing flight test on Nov. 2.
Meanwhile, on Dec. 9 the Zhuque-2 Y-3 carrier rocket was sent into space from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.
It was the third flight mission of the Zhuque-2 carrier rocket and the success of this launch mission made Zhuque-2 China's first commercial liquid carrier rocket to complete successive launches.
This same launch center also saw activity on Dec. 5 when China launched a CERES-1 Y9 carrier rocket, sending two new satellites to their planned orbits, and marking the 11th flight mission of the CERES-1 rocket series.
Developed by Beijing-based Galactic Energy, CERES-1 is a small-scale solid-propellant carrier rocket designed to send micro-satellites to low orbit.
The launch mission on Dec. 5 was the first by this commercial rocket developer to successfully send satellites to the twilight orbit.
KEY TECHNOLOGIES
The hat-trick of rocket launches in the first ten days of December can be seen as confirmation of the rapid advancement of China's commercial space industry.
The high cost of rocket launches is regarded as a ""roadblock"" that hinders mankind's large-scale access to space, and the reusability of launch vehicles is the most important means of reducing such costs.
To develop recoverable and reusable launch vehicles is a must for commercial spaceflight companies both at home and abroad in order to pursue the highest input-output ratio, said Ji Haibo, chief designer of the iSpace rocket SQX-2Y.
The two recent successful launches have verified the rapid reuse capability of this rocket, which means iSpace has made inroads into mastering a series of key technologies for the low-altitude return and landing of reusable rockets and their reuse, Ji added.
Methane is inexpensive and easy to purchase, and the characteristics of liquid oxygen methane, which is resistant to coking and carbon buildup, are conducive to the maintenance of engines and rockets, making its use one of the feasible paths to building reusable rockets, said Liu Lei, general manager of the engine R&D department of LandSpace.
Independently developed by LandSpace, the Zhuque-2 is China's first medium- and large-size liquid rocket with liquid oxygen and methane as propellants.
Soon after the successful liftoff of the Zhuque-2 Y-3 carrier rocket, LandSpace unveiled its development plan for the Zhuque-3, which will be propelled by its methane engines.
LandSpace said the first stage of Zhuque-3 will be reusable for no less than 20 launches and designed with a strong launch capability that can help build a large-scale satellite internet constellation.
All these technological breakthroughs would not have been achieved without policy support. In 2014, the Chinese government opened up the country's space sector to private investment, with numerous aerospace startups founded shortly afterwards.
Galactic Energy was co-founded by Xia Dongkun with other partners in 2018.
The company provides commercial carrier rocket launch services and has unveiled research plans named after the Ceres and Pallas asteroids.
""Ceres and Pallas are asteroids that seemed far away from the Earth when they were discovered. However, now a human-made space probe has visited Ceres. We hope that rockets developed by our company will also bring space, which previously seemed so far away, closer to people's daily lives,"" said Xia, a former senior technician with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
EXTENSIVE APPLICATION
Rockets are the most important vehicles for achieving space programs, and the main customers of commercial space companies now are commercial satellite companies.
""We are more aimed at the commercial market. What customers need is what we will seek to research and develop,"" said Xia.
Guodian Gaoke, a Beijing-based commercial sci-tech firm, had their four satellites, Tianqi 21-24, sent to space aboard the CERES-1 rocket on Sept. 5.
The four satellites are part of the Tianqi low-Earth orbit Internet of Things constellation.
According to the company, the 38-satellite constellation will go into operation in 2024. It will provide global data services for application scenarios such as emergency communications, ecological environment monitoring, and tower detection.
Large-capacity rockets can certainly launch small commercial low orbit satellites, but the ""starting price"" is higher, said Pei Yao, a senior staff member at Guodian Gaoke.
Commercial rocket companies have developed small-capacity, low-orbit launch plans that can accurately match this demand, and the prices they offer are much lower, providing an additional option for satellite companies, added Pei.
Commercial rockets and satellites are both important components of China's commercial space industry, and the size of this market has now exceeded one trillion yuan (about 141 billion U.S. dollars), with the number of registered and effectively operating commercial space enterprises in China exceeding 400.
""Through continuous research, development and improvement, commercial rocket companies have been able to work out a set of standardized processes applicable to the whole industrial chain, driving commercial spaceflight towards a virtuous circle and making it more and more popular,"" Liu said confidently.

In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have picked up pace in empowering various industries in China.
Thanks to technological advances and commercialization of research findings, UAVs' application has been expanded into more and more fields, such as agricultural and forestry plant protection, emergency rescue, cultural relics protection, and power line inspection.
In Beijing's Yanqing district, two sets of DJI Dock 2, a new drone dock developed by Chinese drone maker DJI, stand guard day and night at the southern and northern parts of the Badaling section of the Great Wall.
With the support of the drone docks, drones autonomously perform 10 patrol flights on five routes over the scenic area on a daily basis. The routes cover basically all the areas open to visitors.
Video footages from the drones are sent to the management center of the scenic area in real time, so that uncivilized tourist behavior can be discovered and discouraged in time. At night, infrared cameras on the drones make it hard for rule-breakers, including overnight campers, to evade surveillance.
In addition, the DJI Dock 2 can autonomously generate high-precision 3D models of key areas of the scenic area every two weeks. Through comparison of the 3D models, relevant personnel can notice changes in the natural conditions of the scenic area, such as landslides and wall shifts, in a timely manner, and carry out targeted examination and repair.
In Wensu county, Aksu prefecture, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, plant protection drones have made farmers' work in the fields much easier.
""Defoliant can remove the leaves from cotton trees while retaining the branches and cotton, thus preventing leaves from mixing with cotton and affecting cotton quality during harvest,"" said Zhu Rui, a drone pilot of a Wensu county-based company specializing in agricultural plant protection-related services.
""This M-22 drone was jointly developed by my company and our partners. It can spray chemicals over 400 mu (about 26.67 hectares) to 500 mu of cotton fields per day,"" Zhu said, while operating a drone to spray defoliant over a cotton field.

""Agricultural and forestry plants including walnut trees, Chinese date trees, apple trees, wheat crops, and shelter forests are all taken care of using plant protection drones. They have significantly eased farmers' workload and increased their income,"" Zhu noted.
According to Zhu, drones can increase farmland yields by over 10 percent and reduce the average cost per mu of farmland by more than 30 percent.
In April this year, when a forest fire erupted in Longjingwan village, Baoluan township, Fengdu county, southwest China's Chongqing municipality, dense vegetation and complex terrain made it dangerous for emergency response teams to approach the forests without an accurate judgment of the situation.
Fortunately, several drones soon arrived over the scene, helping rescue teams get a clear understanding of the fire lines, ignition points and the geographical conditions of the locality.
""Commander, there are two fire lines to the southeast and southwest, plus three separate ignition points. The terrain is gentler to the northwest. I suggest entering the scene from that direction,"" a rescuer reported.
With the help of drones, the fire was quickly extinguished.
Last year, Fengdu county equipped all its townships, subdistricts and relevant authorities with 36 domestically produced drones, achieving full coverage of drone-empowered intelligent oversight, according to Tang Shouyuan, county mayor of Fengdu.
""As air vehicles, drones are not limited to ground transportation constraints and can perform complex operations,"" Tan Xiang, executive secretary general of the Research Center for UAV Applications and Regulation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out.
In recent years, China's drone industry has achieved notable progress, with products enjoying higher reliability, lower costs, and diversified application scenarios, Tan said, noting that China has become one of the world's largest industrial drone markets.

""Widespread application of industrial drones in agricultural plant protection, electricity supply, geography, security, marine science, meteorology, environmental protection, construction, healthcare, among other fields, has profoundly transformed people's modes of production and lifestyles,"" Tan said.
Technological innovations have played a crucial role in underpinning the extensive application of drones across industries.
Pointing out that some people in many sectors still have to work in complex and dangerous environments and perform repetitive tasks, Zhang Xiaonan, strategic director of DJI, said technological progress is supposed to help frontline workers complete missions more easily.
""Where there are pain points, there are sources of inspiration for innovations,"" Zhang noted.
The DJI Dock 2, for instance, allows drones to autonomously complete flight missions without the need for a pilot to operate them.
The technical team of DJI envisioned the Dock as the ""home"" of drones. Equipped with various software and hardware, the ""home"" enables drones to make flight plans, perform flight missions, collect data, recharge, and complete other operations autonomously.
It took DJI 10 years to gain insights into users' pain points, hone its Dock products, and finally win market recognition, according to Zhang.
The DJI Dock 2, as the second version of DJI Dock, is smaller but smarter. Compared to the initial version, the DJI Dock 2 has experienced a size reduction of 75 percent and a weight reduction of 68 percent, alongside significant increases in effective operational radius, flight time and professional surveying and mapping capabilities.
The continuous emergence of sci-tech achievements has contributed to the formation of a solid foundation for China's drone industrial chain, according to Tan.

Chinese researchers develop novel dry-powder inhalable vaccine platform

BEIJING, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed a single-dose dry-powder inhalable vaccine platform featuring the nano-micro composite multilevel structure, significantly contributing to the prevention and treatment of respiratory infectious diseases in the future, according to a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
Researchers have made significant progress in developing vaccines for respiratory infectious diseases in recent years. Most of these vaccines, however, are administered through intramuscular injection, which primarily induces a humoral immune response and relies on serum antibodies to neutralize the virus. Unfortunately, this approach often fails to trigger a mucosal immune response and establish a robust immune barrier in the respiratory tract.
Moreover, adjuvants commonly used in current vaccines (e.g., aluminum adjuvants) can not induce cellular immune responses and are ineffective in combating rapid virus variation. Additionally, the current liquid form of vaccines necessitates strict low-temperature storage conditions, and the two- or three-dose vaccination schedule also impacts the overall vaccination rate.
Therefore, interdisciplinary integration and innovative research concepts are needed to develop safer and more efficient vaccines for respiratory infections.
Researchers from the State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering at the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences have proposed a new ""nano-micro composite"" delivery concept for inhaled vaccines and developed a new vaccine platform to tackle these challenges together with researchers from the State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity at Beijing Institute of Biotechnology.
The platform, featuring fast preparation, efficient delivery, easy storage and transportation at room temperature, and sustained release, has successfully prepared vaccines in the laboratory, proven to be effective in blocking respiratory viral infection and transmission in animal models.
The platform combines biodegradable microspheres with protein nanoparticles. The surface of these nanoparticles can simultaneously display multiple antigens, thus inducing a broad-spectrum immune response and expanding the range of vaccine protection. The platform also allows for the quick and convenient development of other respiratory virus vaccines thanks to the flexibility of antigen presentation.
The unique nano-micro composite structure of the platform enables a potent immune response in the lungs by facilitating high-performance delivery. Once the antigen nanoparticles are released, they are efficiently taken up by antigen-presenting cells.
The dry-powder vaccine can significantly reduce storage and transportation costs, making it suitable for areas with limited refrigeration facilities, thus improving immunization coverage. The sustained release of antigens in the vaccine can induce long-lasting humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity with just a single inhalation.
In addition, researchers developed a model of airborne protection, contact protection, and airborne transmission blocking, which described the benefits of inhaled vaccines for preventing virus infection and transmission.
""The components of this nano-micro system use natural proteins and approved polymer materials, and the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine have been systematically studied in non-human primates, indicating its great potential for clinical translation,"" said Wei Wei, a researcher from the IPE.

Chinese researchers develop novel dry-powder inhaled vaccine technology; study published in Nature
By Liu Xin (Global Times) 11:26, December 14, 2023
Researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have proposed a new “nano-micro composite” delivery concept for vaccines and developed a single-dose, dry-powder, inhalable vaccine platform. The vaccine made in the laboratory based on the technology is effective in blocking respiratory viral infection and transmission in animal test, showing great promise for combating future emerging and epidemic infectious diseases. This study was published in Nature on Wednesday.
In recent years, researchers have made significant progress in developing vaccines for infectious respiratory diseases. However, most of these vaccines are administered through intramuscular injection, which primarily induces a humoral immune response and relies on blood antibodies to neutralize the virus. This approach fails to trigger a mucosal immune response and establish a robust immune barrier in the respiratory tract, according to a release from the research group.
The current liquid form of vaccines requires to be stored in strict low-temperature, and the two- or three-dose vaccination schedule also impacts the overall vaccination rate.
In confronting these problems, professor Wei Wei and professor Ma Guanghui from the State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering at IPE, in cross-disciplinary collaboration with professor Wang Hengliang and professor Zhu Li from the State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, have developed a new vaccine platform.
This platform combines biodegradable microspheres with protein nanoparticles. The surface of these nanoparticles can simultaneously display multiple antigens, thus inducing a broad-spectrum immune response and expanding the range of vaccine protection. The platform also allows for the quick and convenient development of other respiratory virus vaccines due to the flexibility of antigen presentation.
The platform’s unique nano-micro composite structure enables an efficient immune response in the lungs by facilitating high-performance delivery. Once antigen-nanoparticles are released, they can be efficiently taken up by antigen-presenting cells.
Moreover, this dry powder vaccine significantly reduces storage and transportation costs, making it suitable for areas with limited refrigeration facilities, thus improving immunization rates.

The sustained release of antigens in the vaccine induces long-lasting humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity with just a single inhalation.
In cooperation with professor He Zhanlong of the Institute of Medical Biology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the researchers developed a model of airborne protection, close contact protection, and airborne transmission blocking, which demonstrated that an inhaled vaccine is highly effective in preventing the virus infection and transmission.
“The components of this nano-micro system used natural proteins and approved polymer materials, and the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine have been systematically studied in non-human primates, indicating its great potential for clinical translation,” professor Wei said.

A college research team from East China’s Jiangsu Province has recently released China’s first large language model (LLM), a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively big data sets to help conduct research on Chinese ancient books.
The LLM for ancient books was designed to intelligently process ancient texts, promote innovative development in the research and preservation of Chinese ancient books, enhance the efficiency and quality of the inheritance of traditional Chinese culture, and facilitate deep integration between LLMs and the processing of ancient books.
The LLM “Xunzi,” named after Xun Zi, one of the most famous philosophers in ancient China for his Confucian classic Xunzi, contains the vast majority of Chinese ancient books and documents including the collections of the “Complete Library in Four Sections” or “Siku Quanshu,” with a large-scale corpus of over 2 billion Chinese characters and words.
With the model, researchers can swiftly summarize the ancient texts and know about the themes of the ancient books. The model can also extract key information from the ancient texts, such as characters, events and places, to sort out the information with efficiency.
Besides, the model can also automatically generate ancient poems that comply with grammar and prosody rules with the prompts the users give to it to provide inspiration for poetry lovers. It can also precisely translate ancient texts into modern Chinese to help researchers understand the original meaning and connotation of ancient texts.
Led by Wang Dongbo, professor from College of Information Management of Nanjing Agricultural University in Nanjing, Jiangsu, the research team has been working in the area of digitization of ancient books and documents for a decade. Supported by the presence of the university’s strong computing power and based on the application scenarios provided by Zhonghua Book Company, the research team accomplished China’s first open-source LLM for ancient texts in AI.
The LLM has been published on websites such as github.com and modelscope.cn as open-source software, allowing users to download and use it for free.

China will devote more financial resources and roll out new policies to encourage companies to achieve breakthroughs in crucial technologies in 2024, as part of its broader push to cultivate new productivity boosters for economic growth amid challenges and external uncertainties, officials and experts said on Wednesday.
Specific measures could include leveraging government bonds to support innovation by companies and motivating private companies to participate in key innovation projects, they added.
The comments came after the Central Economic Work Conference, which ended on Tuesday, called for efforts to promote industrial innovation through sci-tech innovation, and in particular, to forge new industries, models and impetus with disruptive and cutting-edge technologies.
Lin Zechang, head of the Ministry of Finance's general affairs department, said at a seminar in Beijing on Wednesday that the ministry will actively support technological innovation, guarantee the funding for research on core technologies and continuously increase support for basic research.
Zhao Xijun, co-president of the China Capital Market Research Institute at Renmin University of China, said that there are many fiscal policy tools to support technological innovation, including offering companies tax rebates and setting up government-initiated innovation funds.
""The Central Economic Work Conference said China will reasonably expand the scope of local governments' special bonds for use as capital next year. It is likely the scope will be expanded to support innovation by enterprises,"" Zhao told China Daily.
It is also possible for the country to explore innovative methods, such as issuing special government bonds, to support strategically important innovation projects, he added.
Hong Qunlian, a researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission's Academy of Macroeconomic Research, said the tone-setting meeting made the construction of a modern industrial system through technological innovation the top priority for next year's economic work, which highlights the crucial role of innovation-driven growth in upgrading the country's economy.
The key phrase, ""new productivity boosters"", which was highlighted at the meeting, means China is seeking high-quality and highly efficient growth, Hong said.
Hong added that compared with traditional productivity tools that are driven by elements such as labor, land and capital, new productivity boosters are led by technological innovation and new elements such as data.
""More efforts are expected to be made to encourage companies to achieve breakthroughs in key technologies, such as chip, and other technical bottlenecks, amid intensified global competition and geopolitical uncertainties,"" he said. ""Without breakthroughs in these areas, it is impossible to achieve industrial upgrade and industrial security.""
Gao Dongsheng, chief economist at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said the ministry will step up efforts to upgrade traditional industries and nurture frontier technologies, such as artificial intelligence and humanoid robots.
Han Wenxiu, executive deputy director of the office of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, said on Wednesday that China is working to comprehensively deepen reform, which will inject new impetus into economic growth.
Han said that China, with a well-established industrial system and strong supporting capabilities, possesses unique advantages. He said the country's breakthroughs in technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence, commercial aerospace, quantum technology and bio-manufacturing, are rapidly advancing.
Zhang Shixian, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Industrial Economics, said, ""The meeting emphasized strengthening the leading role of enterprises in technological innovation, which will contribute to better aligning technological innovation with economic development.""
The government is likely to roll out more policies to encourage enterprises, especially private companies, to participate in key innovation projects, Zhang said.
Gao Wei, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics' School of Economics, said it is worth noting that the meeting also highlighted the role of venture capital and private equity in nurturing innovation, during which market-driven mechanism will be fully used.
Zhou Hongyi, founder of Chinese cybersecurity company 360 Security Group, said the meeting provides clear guidance for China's industrial transformation and points to the direction the country should take to promote global economic recovery.
""We will push more to promote innovation and help strengthen the security of industrial and supply chains,"" Zhou said.

Chinese scientists build largest-ever neutral hydrogen catalog in deep space,2023-12-13,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1213/c90000-20109766.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists build largest-ever neutral hydrogen catalog in deep space
 (Xinhua) 15:11, December 13, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), or the ""China Sky Eye,"" a team of Chinese astronomers built the largest-ever high-quality catalog of neutral hydrogen (HI) sources beyond our Galaxy.
Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is a key component of galaxies. Within disk galaxies, the HI is a significant component of the interstellar medium.
The measurement of its abundance and kinematics via the 21-centimeter emission line could potentially address a number of astrophysical issues, such as the possible properties of dark matter, faint unknown galaxies, as well as the cosmic structure and evolution.
The new catalog contained a total of 41,741 HI sources discovered between August 2020 and June 2023, outnumbering similar ones around the world in both quantity and quality.
The work is part of a project called the FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI), designed to cover the entire sky visible to the FAST. The current survey results are derived from approximately 35 percent of the total sky, and more than 100,000 HI sources are expected to be recorded over the next five years.
The FAST is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, with a reception area equal to 30 standard football fields. FAST officially began operating on Jan. 11, 2020, in a naturally deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
The FAST is an optimal tool for HI surveys, with higher spectral and spatial resolution, broader coverage, and more reliable and complete data quality.
When completed, FASHI will provide the largest extragalactic HI catalog as well as objective view of HI content and large-scale structure in the local universe.
The findings were recently published in the journal SCIENCE CHINA Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy. Researchers from Guizhou University, the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University all contributed to the study.
Lister Staveley-Smith, professor from the University of Western Australia and a peer reviewer of the paper, called their work ""an impressive milestone.""

China Focus: High-quality Han Chinese complete genome reference assembled,2023-12-12,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1212/c90000-20109305.html,"Home>>
		
China Focus: High-quality Han Chinese complete genome reference assembled
 (Xinhua) 19:02, December 12, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- A team of geneticists has assembled a complete human genome reference for Han Chinese, the first of its kind and which could potentially promote precision medicine in China.
The telomere-to-telomere (T2T) gapless diploid genome sequence of a healthy male individual, named T2T-YAO, contained two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, and the Y-chromosome that passes only from male parents to male offspring.
A complete and accurate reference genome has been a long-standing goal in the biomedical research community since the initiation of the Human Genome Project three decades ago.
A similar work, T2T-CHM13, published in 2022 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, fulfilled 8 percent of the previously unknown highly repetitive region in the human genome.
However, it was of European-origin and without the Y-chromosome, thus not enough for representing all individuals worldwide.
The scientists from Peking University People's Hospital and Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, collected samples from an ancient village in Hongtong County in Shanxi Province in the north of China, a place believed to be a starting point of the countrywide mass migration in around the late 14th century.
The YAO part of the name stems from the sampling point located near the ruins of the capital of the legendary Chinese emperor Yao, while T2T stands for telomere-to-telomere or end-to-end sequence of all chromosomes in the genome.
The quality of YAO sequencing is the best among all currently available human genome assemblies, according to the study published in the journal Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics.
Also, this version with a single set of chromosomes has reached a high quality of fewer than one error per 29.5 million basepairs, which is ""generally better than that of T2T-CHM13,"" said Kang Yu, a scientist from BIG.
GENETIC DISCREPANCY
At the early stage of gene sequencing, scientists found a strong similarity between human genes and those of chimpanzees and even rodents. Also, based on partial human genomes that contain mainly protein-coding genes in previous studies, it had been believed that the genome differences between individuals of different races were only 0.1 percent, which meant that all humans could share a single reference genome.
However, a comparative analysis conducted by the Chinese team has revealed that about 11 percent of YAO's genome is not alignable to that of T2T-CHM13, with about 3,000 different genes in each genome, a discrepancy much wider than previously estimated, said Gao Zhancheng from Peking University People's Hospital, the paper's correspondence author.
The significant discrepancies between the individual genomes of the two human populations in the study are mainly attributed to the mass of non-coding DNA, accounting for nearly 99 percent of the genome, he added.
Recently, some of those non-coding DNA sequences were found to serve important functional roles, such as in the regulation of gene expression, while the functions of other non-coding DNA remain unknown.
Gao and his collaborators have found that YAO is mostly of East Asian origin and admixed with sporadic predicted markers of South Asia, Europe, and America.
The markers from South Asia are a little more than those stemming from Europe and America, revealing greater genetic exchange between the East Asian and South Asian ethnic groups, according to the study.
In addition, the haplotype of Y-chromosome in YAO, a predominant type in China and Asia, has also been identified in ancient DNA samples from a Neolithic site in the nearby Shaanxi Province dating back to approximately 4,000 years ago, which suggests a potential genetic continuity in the region from the earliest days of human habitation in this part of China.
The reference human genome is known as a genetic ""navigation map"" widely used in human genetics and medical research, and the great genome discrepancies among ethnic groups suggest that YAO is a more appropriate reference genome for Han Chinese.
The YAO genome can provide more accurate gene and mutation information for the Han Chinese population in establishing a technical system and quality benchmark for clinical research such as genetic disease diagnosis, disease risk prediction, cancer studies, and precision medicine in China, commented Cheng Jing from Tsinghua University, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
