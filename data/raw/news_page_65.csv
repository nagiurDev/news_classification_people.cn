Chinese university tackles rotor failure in drones with algorithm
 (Xinhua) 10:13, January 17, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- For a drone with four propellers, also known as a quadcopter, the failure of one motor is a big problem. With only three rotors working, the drone loses stability and inevitably crashes unless an emergency control strategy sets in.
Researchers at Beihang University, specializing in aeronautical and astronautical research, have now found a solution to this problem: They designed an algorithm to stabilize the drone and keep it flying autonomously after one, two or even three rotors suddenly give out.
""When one rotor fails, the drone begins to spin on itself like a gyro,"" said lead researcher Quan Quan, a professor at the university.
This high-speed rotational motion will cause controllers to fail. Once it starts spinning, the drone can no longer estimate its position in the sky and eventually crashes.
In this new study, the problem was ingeniously tackled by Quan's team, who eschewed the conventional approach of controller switching and instead employed a sophisticated technique known as ""uniform passive fault-tolerant control.""
The algorithm enables the onboard computer to control the drone as it flies and spins, even if three propellers fail.
""The algorithm we have developed enables a functional propeller to generate the entire lift of the drone after it starts spinning -- it's akin to engaging in a game of table tennis where an adept player possesses the ability to serve, dash across to the opposing side, and skillfully catch the ball, thus seamlessly completing the game single-handedly,"" Quan explained to Xinhua.
The research findings appeared in the international journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics. It also featured a video showcasing the successful execution of outdoor experiments. During these experiments, the quadcopter demonstrated its ability to maintain safe flight even when faced with one, two or three rotor failures.
Ke Chenxu, a primary participant in the research and a Ph.D. student at the university, said that the method can be applied to multi-rotor drones with six or eight rotors.
According to the researchers, the study holds massive significance, as quadcopters are increasingly ubiquitous, spanning from fire rescue operations to package delivery services. They believe this fault-tolerant control method has the potential to enhance quadrotor flight safety across all domains.

3D printing enhancing the lives of Chinese people
 (People's Daily Online) 10:35, January 16, 2024
3D printing is a digital manufacturing process that creates three-dimensional objects by layering materials. Today, 3D printing is beginning to become more and more relevant to the lives of the Chinese people. It has become a valuable tool in many fields, including medicine, construction, aerospace, industrial production, education, and cultural heritage conservation.
People's Daily Overseas Edition has focused on three areas close to daily life to show just how impactful 3D printing has become: building homes, medical treatment, and DIY crafts.
Building blocks: 3D printed modular homes are becoming an internet sensation
Four months ago, the 56-year-old Zhang Guolie would never have imagined that his home would become an internet sensation.
Located in Songzhuang, a village in Gucheng county, north China’s Hebei Province, Zhang’s 400 square-meter farmhouse has become a viral photo spot. The building was constructed with 3D printing technology and was assembled like building blocks. After the 3D-printed wall modules were transported to the construction site, the installation of the main structure was finished in just seven days.

The structure was jointly completed by the intelligent construction team of the College of Civil Engineering and Architecture (CCEA) of Zhejiang University and three companies.
""The entire building structure, including the houses, courtyard walls, columns, as well as decorations like flower beds, floor tiles, rockery, and sculptures, were 3D printed from concrete,"" said Sun Xiaoyan, an associate professor at the CCEA.
Sun added that 3D printers built up concrete materials layer by layer to form wall modules.

""From the initial design stage, we gave full consideration to functions like heat insulation and sound insulation, as well as requirements for earthquake and disaster resistance,"" said Professor Wang Hailong, who is also the director of the Institute of Intelligent Construction and Engineering Management at Zhejiang University.
“We also used low-carbon concrete made from solid waste, making it even more environmentally friendly,” Wang added.
According to Wang, the team has been dedicated to research on digital construction technology since 2013. So far, they have obtained over 30 domestic and foreign invention patents on 3D printing materials, equipment, structure, and construction methods, and their equipment and technologies have been exported abroad.
“The construction cost of the courtyard is about 300,000 yuan (about $42,238.7), which is close to that of a common brick-concrete house in rural areas,” said Zhang Yan'an, deputy head of the bureau of agriculture and rural affairs of Gucheng county.
“As rural areas often face a labor shortage in terms of building houses, 3D printing provides new opportunities for the construction of a beautiful countryside,” Zhang added.
Printing bones: 3D printing revolutionizing medicine
In a room at the 3D Printing Consultation Center of the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, various 3D-printed models of human bones and joints are displayed on shelves.

“The use of models for surgical design is the first level medical application of 3D printing. With this model, the size of the tumor, its location, and its relationship with surrounding organs, blood vessels, nerves, and so on are clearly visible, which not only reduces surgery time but also helps young doctors grow faster,” said Hao Yongqiang, a chief physician at the hospital's Department of Orthopedics.
The application of 3D printing has enabled precise treatment in orthopedic surgery, while 3D bio-printed active tissues or organs represent the highest level of 3D printing for medical applications.
Two years ago, a 16-year-old female patient was diagnosed as suffering from a tumor in the proximal left tibia. Hao used 3D bio-printed personalized active bone scaffolds to repair her bone defects, the first use of this technology pioneered by Chinese scientists. As a result, only a month or so later the patient was back in school moving freely, even participating in physical education classes.

With 35 years of medical experience, Hao has helped countless patients benefit from 3D printing technology.
Hao serves as director of the Medical 3D Printing Innovation Research Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, which was established in 2016. So far, nearly 100 medical 3D printing sub-centers have been established in 28 provinces across China.
DIY ceramics: How 3D printing is improving creativity
In ancient times, the design and creation of porcelain pieces was a multiple month process reserved only for experts. Today, people at home with the right materials can produce ceramics in 15 minutes.
This is thanks to Liu Wenqiang, founder of Jinan ChenKun Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. The company, located in east China's Shandong Province, has developed a series of ceramic 3D printers suitable for various uses.
""We have products suitable for ordinary consumers as well as professionals and companies,"" said Liu.

""Ceramic 3D printers greatly reduce the cost of artistic creation and artistic experience,"" Liu added.
He stated that 3D printing can help users overcome the limits of traditional handmade ceramic techniques to create more complex and diversified shapes.
Jill Taylor, a 60-plus-year-old American, is one of the people who has enjoyed the freedom of creativity provided by Liu’s 3D printers. An avid pottery lover, Taylor found that her old age made it difficult for her hands to create the pieces her mind envisioned. With the use of the company’s products, she was able to print the intricate pieces needed to finish her works, which she proudly shared on social media.

HOHHOT, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have started breeding experiments on 66,500 potato seeds that were taken into space aboard the Shenzhou-16 crewed spaceship and stayed for over 180 days.
After the seed germination, cultivation and transplantation, superior seed varieties will be selected and further evaluated, said Zhang Linhai, director of the technology innovation center of Xisen Potato Industry Co., Ltd., which is in charge of the task.
Space breeding refers to exposing seeds or strains to cosmic radiation and microgravity in space to mutate their genes, so as to create new species or varieties with greater performances like shorter growth period, higher yield and better resistance to diseases.
Researchers from the center in Shangdu County in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plan to breed potato varieties with salt-alkali tolerance and higher yields through experiments that use advanced gene-editing technology to assist traditional genetic breeding.
This approach has the potential to reduce the breeding cycle from over a decade to just a few years, Zhang said.
It is the second time Xisen Potato Industry Co., Ltd. has sent seeds into space. In June 2022, 20,000 potato seeds selected by the company were sent to China's space station via Shenzhou-14, returning to earth after 182 days.
It was in 1987 that China sent its first crop seeds including rice and pepper into space, marking the start of the country's space breeding journey. Over the past thirty-odd years, it has conducted over 30 such space experiments involving plant seeds, seedlings and strains, resulting in the cultivation of almost 1,000 new varieties.

Baidu strongly denies rumor of link between its AI tool and China’s military research
 (Global Times) 08:02, January 16, 2024
China's tech giant Baidu on Monday strongly denied allegations of ties between its generative artificial intelligence (AI) product and China's military research after some media outlets claimed the company's ChatGPT-like ERNIE Bot was engaged in the training of the AI system of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China, leading to Baidu's shares plunging by around 10 percent.
The South China Morning Post reported on Friday that a university affiliated with the PLA Strategic Support Force was teaching its experimental AI system more about facing unpredictable human enemies by testing the AI system with the help of Baidu's large language model ERNIE Bot.
""Baidu has not engaged in any business collaboration or provided any tailored service to authors of the academic paper or any institutions with which they are affiliated,"" Baidu told the Global Times on Monday, emphasizing that ERNIE Bot is available to and can be used by the general public.
The basis of the report is a research paper published in the Chinese academic journal Command Control &Simulation in December 2023 by researchers from the PLA's Information Engineering University, where researchers used the US military invasion of Libya in 2011 as an example. They input the forces and weapons deployment of both sides of the conflict, as well as the desired targets in order for ERNIE Bot, which debuted in 2023, to predict the US army's combat strategy.
Baidu said that the academic paper mentioned several large language models such as GPT3.5, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT4, HTML-T5, and Baidu's ERNIE Bot and described how the authors received responses from them, emphasizing that the functions used by the authors are available to any user interacting with generative AI tools.
""The South China Morning Post, the first media outlet that reported on this academic paper, has clarified and corrected its original media report,"" said the Chinese internet giant in a statement on Monday, vowing that the company will operate its AI related products and businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and best corporate practices.
Earlier on Saturday, Baidu said, ""We have no knowledge of the research project, and if our large language model was used, it would have been the version that is publicly available online"".
Some media reported that the speculative link raised concerns that the US may consider imposing sanctions on Chinese firms as part of efforts to contain its geopolitical rival. Analysts criticized the unfounded claim, saying it has sparked baseless and unfounded suspicions, causing harm to Chinese companies.
""Some Western media always tend to spread the theory of so-called threat posed by China. Why don't they talk about the threats caused by ChatGPT developed by the US?"" Song Zhongping, a TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday.

Sugar in brain may increase antifungal drug tolerance: study
 (Xinhua) 15:02, January 15, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have recently revealed that glucose in the brain may elicit antifungal tolerance in a certain fungus, contributing to the treatment of fungal meningitis.
Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that infects the human brain, is the leading cause of fungal meningitis and leads to around 180,000 deaths per year. Currently, the only fungicidal drug available to treat it is amphotericin B.
Despite amphotericin B's excellence in vitro bactericidal activity against C. neoformans, there is high incidence of treatment failure and recurrent infections in cryptococcal meningitis with the cause still unknown.
To address this challenge, researchers at the Institute of Microbiology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a high-throughput screen, and validated brain tissues from mice and human cerebrospinal fluid, to explore the effect of hundreds of metabolites on the interactions between C. neoformans and amphotericin B.
They identified that glucose in the brain elicits antifungal tolerance through the C. neoformans protein, Mig1, which is a regulator of glucose repression.
The researchers found that in mice, Mig1 inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a component of fungal cell membranes, which is the target of amphotericin B, and promotes the production of inositolphosphorylceramide, another component of fungal cell membranes, which competes with amphotericin B for ergosterol, limiting the drug's effectiveness.
The researchers then discovered that using an inhibitor of inositolphosphorylceramide together with amphotericin B improves treatment efficacy against cryptococcal meningitis in mice.
The study has been published in the journal of Nature Microbiology.

Astronomers reveal formation process of primitive star clusters,2024-01-15,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0115/c90000-20122041.html,"Home>>
		
Astronomers reveal formation process of primitive star clusters
 (Xinhua) 14:54, January 15, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- An international team of astronomers has unveiled the findings of a study on the formation process of high-mass protostellar clusters, where stars like the sun originate.
It is known that the distant luminosity observed through telescopes comes mainly from a small number of high-mass stars, weighing at least eight times as much as the sun and born in massive protostellar clusters, or primitive star clusters. However, little research on how such clusters originally formed has been conducted.
To find the answer, a team led by researchers at Peking University used several large radio telescopes from home and abroad to undertake high-definition observations of protostellar clusters.
For example, they used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomical facility, to observe 11 massive and luminous clusters in the Milky Way.
Following years of study, they have finally revealed the mystery of the complete and dynamic evolution process of such high-mass clusters, in collaboration with researchers from more than 20 universities and research institutions, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Chile, and the Harvard &Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the United States.
Numerous stars are generally thought to be formed in molecular clouds, a kind of condensation of cool and dense gas in galaxies, according to their research results published in the Astrophysical Journal and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
""We dynamically observed that dense cores in molecular clouds collapse and contract under gravity, eventually forming primitive stars, known as protostars,"" said Xu Fengwei, first author of the paper at Peking University.
A large number of protostars with gravitational interaction then form clusters, which grow closer and tighter under the continuous collapse and contraction of molecular clouds, he said.
In the 11 clusters the team observed using ALMA, they identified 248 dense cores, including 106 candidates showing protostellar signatures.
The giant molecular clouds continue to convey their gas inwards as they evolve under gravitational contraction, while more gas feeds the cloud center's high-density cores, which then grow faster. ""This may explain the known fact that high-mass stars generally form in the center of stellar clusters,"" Xu explained.
However, only small parts of the molecular clouds are converted into stars, and the remainder either exist in the form of diffuse gas or return to interstellar mediums.
Wang Ke, an astrophysics researcher at Peking University, said that instead of just observing mature star clusters, astronomers are now able to study the evolution of early clusters with improved radio telescope technology, and deepen the understanding of their formation.

Chinese scientists make progress on continuum robot obstacle avoidance
 (Xinhua) 11:27, January 15, 2024
SHENYANG, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have made progress in their research on the active obstacle avoidance of continuum robots, a development that has the potential to elevate the intelligence of robot-assisted surgeries.
The research was conducted by a team led by Liu Hao, a researcher at the Shenyang Institute of Automation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with Zhang Zhongtao's team at the Beijing Friendship Hospital, which is affiliated with the Capital Medical University.
The findings have been published online in the International Journal of Robotics Research.
When operating in complex environments in the cavities of the human body, continuum robots can effectively avoid collisions with human tissue or between multiple robots, which is conducive to ensuring the safety and quality of a surgery.
However, due to the flexible structure of continuum robots and the irregularity of these environments, expressing this spatial and morphological relationship and achieving active, safe interaction pose challenges to enhancing the robots' capabilities in active obstacle avoidance.
To address the issue, the researchers proposed a framework for the control of active obstacle avoidance, including a concise expression of the geometric model of continuum robots and a method to detect collision between a robot and an obstacle of any shape.
The framework is an effective and feasible approach for continuum robots to conduct safe surgeries, and has the potential to promote the level of intelligence in robot-assisted surgeries, according to the researchers.

Chinese scientists achieve ultra-low temperature in supersolid candidate
 (Xinhua) 11:00, January 15, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have achieved ultra-low temperature refrigeration -- below minus 273 degrees Celsius -- in a recently synthesized supersolid candidate.
The temperature was reached without the use of liquid helium, a conventional material that has long been used in ultra-low temperature refrigeration, according to a paper published in Nature.
Supersolid is a quantum state of matter that possesses a solid structure and shows superfluidity simultaneously. A team of researchers at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and their collaborators proved the presence of this exotic state in the synthesized supersolid candidate, a cobalt-based quantum magnetic material.
During the subsequent demagnetization cooling process of the candidate, the researchers observed an ultra-low temperature below 273 degrees Celsius, according to the paper.
The findings have demonstrated a new route to extreme cooling that can be used in fields such as deep space exploration, quantum science and materials science, said Su Gang, the leader of the team.

Digital technologies usher in new possibilities for consumption growth in China
By Lin Lili (People's Daily) 10:57, January 15, 2024
Digital consumption is becoming an important driver for expanding domestic demand, stabilizing economic growth, and promoting industrial transformation in China.
From January to November in 2023, China's online retail sales reached about 13.96 trillion yuan ($1.96 trillion), up 11 percent year on year.

Currently, the burgeoning new forms and models of digital consumption, represented by online shopping, livestreaming, and digital culture, are profoundly changing people's consumption habits.
Thanks to livestreaming promotions, a consumer in Beijing can clearly see a sheep farm over 1,000 kilometers away in Huanxian county, Qingyang city, northwest China's Gansu province, without leaving his home.
""The sheepfold looks quite clean and the sheep all seem energetic. Seeing is believing. I think this shop's mutton must be good,"" said Xu Jie, the customer, sitting at home holding his phone.
Compared to brick-and-mortar vegetable markets, livestreaming can sometimes offer consumers more information about products, he explained, adding that now he often makes purchases online.
""Business has been pretty good lately. With so many regular customers, I can sell about 120 sheep a day,"" said Liu Guoning, an entrepreneur in Huanxian county.
According to Liu, he used to take sheep to the market to sell, or wait for buyers to come to his farm, while now he sells mutton online.
""Since I sold mutton online, I've not only been able to sell all the sheep from my own farm, but also help sell the sheep of other villagers. The profits and efficiency are much better,"" he noted.
One of the prominent features of digital consumption is the broader scope of shopping, which plays a key role in boosting domestic demand.

Nowadays, as consumers' online shopping radius keeps expanding, they can buy products from various parts of the country and even the world without leaving home.
As a result of the continuous improvement of China's rural digital infrastructure and e-commerce logistics systems, local specialties such as mushrooms, eggs, and meat produced in remote regions of the country can now be sold nationwide through e-commerce platforms.
Pinduoduo, a major Chinese e-commerce platform, has established direct connections with over 1,000 agricultural production areas in China, involving more than 16 million farmer households to the digital economy, according to Zhang Chao, an operation manager of Pinduoduo.
""We have actively promoted the application of digital technologies in the circulation and supply of agricultural products, and vigorously advanced the construction of digital information infrastructure, including cold chain logistics of fresh agricultural products,"" Zhang said.
The platform has implemented measures including sending out products within 48 hours after an order is placed and free express delivery services for consumers in remote areas in a bid to boost sales, according to Zhang.
By switching from offline transactions to online transactions, consumers can easily access information about products and services, which saves time and transportation costs that could be incurred during consumption, and expands consumers' shopping radius, giving them more options and autonomy in consumption, said Li Mingtao, head of the research institute at the China International Electronic Commerce Center.
Digital technologies not only broaden consumers' shopping radius, but also incubate new industries, new business forms and models, ushering in greater possibilities of consumption in the country.
In Beijing's Dongcheng district, a consumer named Lin Qing obtained her own digital model after placing an order online, signing an agreement, and having her face scanned, all within about 30 minutes at a special photo studio that creates digital twins for customers.

Lin's digital twin realized many of her dreams in the virtual world, including scoring slam dunks, enjoying skiing, and performing street dance.
""It's really interesting to see the familiar 'me' doing unfamiliar things. I feel like I met another 'me' from a parallel universe,"" Lin said.
""We're building an ecosystem of digital humans where everyone may one day own their digital twins,"" said Liu Zheng, founder of the studio.
In 2023, Chinese people discovered a proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered digital humans in various scenarios.
They saw digital hosts present weather forecast programs, speakers' digital twins take the stage at major conferences, digital livestreaming hosts work 24/7, and digital humans share life wisdom in short videos.
The application of AI has been stretched into various fields, from healthcare, education, finance to transportation, entertainment, and sports, changing the way people live and work.
""The extensive application of the Internet, cloud computing, AI, among other new technologies, has enabled digital technologies to better satisfy people's needs for a better life and unleash consumption potential, making digital technologies a new driving force for consumption growth and economic development,"" said Ren Baoping, a specially appointed professor of the school of digital economy and management of Nanjing University in east China's Jiangsu province.
""We hope to accelerate the expansion of emerging consumption areas like customized consumption, smart consumption, and experiential consumption, as well as to increase effective supplies for digital consumption in healthcare, elderly care, medical services, culture, education, security and other fields,” Ren added.

Chinese scientists bring quantum tech into e-commerce scenarios
 (Xinhua) 10:08, January 15, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists developed an e-commerce strategy that enabled the world's first five-user online trading utilizing quantum technology.
Currently, the e-commerce messages, which are guarded by classical encryption algorithms, are vulnerable to hacking by powerful quantum computing.
Therefore, some cryptologists have tried to use quantum entanglement to securely distribute unhackable quantum states among multiple parties to guard against identity theft and payment fraud.
However, a feasible quantum algorithm that prevents message senders from denying offers they have already made in transactions has not been developed previously.
Researchers at Nanjing University and Renmin University of China created an e-commerce protocol based on a new quantum digital signature (QDS) that generates correlated bit strings among multiple remote parties for signatures via quantum law.
They proposed a QDS approach that combined quantum secret sharing and one-time universal hashing to ensure transaction integrity, authenticity, and, in particular, non-repudiation.
In an experiment, the team demonstrated a five-user quantum network using the protocol, according to the study published on Saturday in the journal Science Advances.
The quantum network can ensure that contract signing and payments are executed fast and accurately, eliminating the need for a trusted third party to be identified in advance.
""Our work contributes to the further development of e-commerce in the quantum era by providing a practical and efficient solution with enhanced security,"" said Yin Hualei, an associate professor from Renmin University of China.

Mutations of blood-creating genes correlated to heart diseases: study
 (Xinhua) 09:56, January 15, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have identified a group of gene mutations that are correlated to an elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), publishing their findings in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology.
In a cohort study of 6,181 Chinese individuals, the researchers from Fuwai Hospital under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences found that the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) -- the presence of a kind of stem cell caused by leukemia-causing mutations -- was associated with a 42 percent increase in CHD risk in 1,100 CHIP carriers compared with those without CHIP.
The study, which was published online on Jan. 10, stated that the elevated CHD risk attributed to those mutations was not negligible.
The results will promote the early prediction of and personalized prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease, said the researchers.

Chinese, US researchers jointly develop new type of stable semiconductor graphene with 10 times higher performance than silicon
By Leng Shumei (Global Times) 09:19, January 15, 2024
Researchers from China and the US have jointly created a new type of stable semiconductor graphene, which displays performance 10 times higher than silicon and 20 times larger than that of the other two-dimensional semiconductors. The achievement marks “a leap from silicon chips to carbon chips,” Ma Lei, leader of the research from the Tianjin International Center for Nanoparticles and Nanosystems (TICNN) at Tianjin University, who led the research, told the Global Times.
The achievement, jointly made by Ma’s team and researchers from School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, was published online on the website of the journal ""Nature"" on January 3, 2024.
With silicon-based chips gradually approaching the physical limit of two nanometers, there is a surge in global demand for chips based on high-quality semiconductor materials. Two-dimensional materials, due to their excellent electronic transport properties and potential for high integration, have become a new frontier that scientists and semiconductor companies around the world are eager to invest in.
Graphene, as the first discovered two-dimensional material that can exist stably at room temperature, has been the focus of scientists' efforts since its discovery in 2004 to design a new type of chip that consumes less energy and operates faster than existing semiconductors. However, the unique Dirac Cones of graphene leads to its ""zero bandgap"" characteristic, which has been the biggest obstacle to its application in the semiconductor field.
By precisely controlling the epitaxial growth process of graphene, Ma’s team introduced a bandgap into graphene, creating a new type of stable semiconductor graphene, which exhibits electron mobility far exceeding that of silicon materials. It displays performance 10 times higher than silicon and 20 times larger than that of the other two-dimensional semiconductors.
“We mainly applied a special growth environment and growth conditions to modulate graphene itself using SiC crystals, achieving the opening of a bandgap in graphene. This transforms the originally gapless graphene into a material with a bandgap,” Ma said. He noted that what the team created “is a true single-crystal graphene semiconductor.”
The development of this semiconductor not only paves the way for high-performance electronic devices surpassing traditional silicon-based technologies but also injects new impetus into the entire semiconductor industry. As the limits predicted by Moore's Law draw closer, the emergence of semiconductor graphene heralds a fundamental shift in the field of electronics. Its breakthrough properties meet the growing demand for higher computing speeds and miniaturized integrated electronic devices, read a report on the Tianjin University’s website.
Once delivered into large scale production, the single-crystal semiconductor graphene will lay an important foundation for the transition from the silicon era to the carbon era. However, whether graphene semiconductors can lead to a breakthrough in the chip industry still needs time to test, Ma noted.
When asked how far the achievement is from industrialization, Ma said he currently cannot predict. “When it can be put into large-scale industrial applications depends on the process from millimeter-scale single crystals to inch-scale single crystals.”
In a related report on January 4 by yicai.com, Ma was quoted as saying that “I estimate that it will take another 10 to 15 years before graphene semiconductors can truly be fully implemented.”
Ma said that now he and his team are working hard to grow larger-sized graphene semiconductor single crystals.
In order to continue to promote the development of semiconductors, countries and regions all over the world are actively seeking new materials and paradigms in addition to two-dimensional materials. In November 2023, Huawei and Harbin Institute of Technology jointly applied for a “hybrid bonding method for three-dimensional integrated chips based on silicon and diamond.” In September 2023, Japanese news outlet Nikkei reported that the Japanese startup company OOKUMA plans to commercialize diamond semiconductors, and will start production as early as the fiscal year 2026.
With the intensification of competition, the US has been increasing its export control measures on chips to China, unreasonably suppressing Chinese semiconductor companies, and attempting to “strangle” China in the semiconductor chip field.
In this context, the achievement by Chinese and American teams has attracted special attention. According to Ma, the intensification of China-US semiconductor competition has indeed had an impact on the cooperation between the scientific teams of the two countries, such as information exchange and sample exchange. However, overall, the cooperation between the two teams has been fruitful.
“Healthy competition is an important factor in promoting development, while malicious competition hinders the development of technology. I hope that cooperation is the mainstream and competition is a stimulant. With cooperation as the mainstream, appropriate competition will make scientific development better and better,” Ma noted.

Chinese researchers develop AI tech to help interpret animal social behavior
 (Xinhua) 10:33, January 13, 2024
BEIJING, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) technology that addresses crucial challenges in accurately detecting animal social behavior, according to the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The most difficult part of multi-animal social behavior analysis is to distinguish between animals that look very similar at the same time.
The new technology, Social Behavior Atlas (SBeA), developed by researchers from the SIAT, can identify similar-looking animals with more than 90 percent accuracy, eliminating the need to define social behavior categories in advance, which may help discovery new, undefined differences in animal social behavior.
The new algorithm can also effectively synthesize a large volume of new data and train models with higher accuracy, thus obtaining more accurate 3D social gesture estimation results, said Wei Pengfei, correspondence author of the study.
SBeA is suitable for accurately calculating 3D social posture, identity and fine social modules in mice, birds and domestic dogs, with potential for cross-species applications, Wei said.
The study was recently published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.
