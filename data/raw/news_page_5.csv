Feature: Chinese scientist's life-long quest to revolutionize wheat breeding,2024-09-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0929/c90000-20224960.html,"Home>>
		
Feature: Chinese scientist's life-long quest to revolutionize wheat breeding
 (Xinhua) 11:07, September 29, 2024
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- At 93, Li Zhensheng, an esteemed academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), has visited more wheat fields than he could ever count, having enjoyed a 70-year career in wheat breeding.
Throughout his life, he has remained devoted to one mission -- ensuring that the Chinese people have enough to eat, and that they eat well.
On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Li was awarded the prestigious Medal of the Republic, honoring his decades-long contributions to agriculture and food security.
Born in 1931 in Zibo, east China's Shandong Province, Li's early life was shaped by hardship. He was a teenager during the great famine of the 1940s, witnessing first-hand the devastating effects of food shortages.
Determined to eradicate hunger in China, Li pursued his passion for agriculture. He was enrolled at Shandong Agricultural College and later joined the CAS.
In 1956, he answered the government's call to support the northwestern region, and went to work in Yangling in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. At the time, wheat stripe rust, a destructive wheat disease, was ravaging the Yellow River Basin, slashing annual wheat yields by more than 5 million tonnes.
Scientists were struggling to develop disease-resistant wheat varieties, which often took eight years of breeding efforts but lost resistance in five and a half years on average. However, Li sought a novel solution.
Inspired by his research on pasture grass, which exhibits strong disease resistance, Li proposed an unconventional idea: hybridizing pasture grass with wheat to produce a disease-resistant strain.
The challenge was immense. Crossbreeding such distant relatives posed numerous scientific hurdles. Yet, undeterred, Li and his team toiled relentlessly, walking 10 km each day to monitor their test fields, and braving harsh weather to plant and harvest wheat.
After more than two decades of research, their perseverance paid off. Li and his team developed the high-yield and disease-resistant ""Xiaoyan"" series. Among them, ""Xiaoyan No. 6"" stood out, resisting eight types of stripe rust while significantly boosting wheat yields. By 2003, over 20 million hectares of ""Xiaoyan"" wheat had been planted nationwide, increasing wheat production by more than 7.5 million tonnes.
Li's breakthroughs didn't stop there. He further revolutionized the wheat breeding system by using chromosome engineering, reducing the timeline for developing hybrid wheat varieties from decades to just three years.
Beyond his work in the field, Li also mulled over new solutions for increasing grain output. In 1987, as vice president of the CAS, he proposed a comprehensive plan to revitalize low-yield farmland in the Huang-Huai-Hai region. The project, lasting over six years, added about 25 million tonnes to China's grain production.
Li's contributions extended into the 1990s and the 21st century, when he pushed for bold initiatives to boost grain output amid stagnation.
In 2011, well into his eighties, Li spearheaded the ""Bohai grain silo"" project, transforming saline land into productive farmland. The project was launched in 2013, boosting grain production in the Bohai rim region by more than 10 million tonnes over five years. Even at 90, Li proposed the creation of a ""coastal grass belt"" to enhance China's feed-grain security.
""Chinese people feed themselves,"" Li said. With his actions, he responded to international concerns about who would feed China's massive population.
Now in his nineties, Li is unable to visit the fields, but he remains engaged in scientific research, mentoring a new generation of agricultural scientists.
""There is a limit to what one can achieve in a lifetime, so the goal must be clear and focused,"" Li told his students.
""Follow the needs of the country and choose wisely what you wish to pursue,"" he said.

Robots make State Grid more efficient in Xinjiang
By Zhuang Qiange and Pang Bo (China Daily) 09:22, September 29, 2024
Employees of the State Grid Corp of China, the world's largest utility company, are embracing the latest technological innovations to safeguard the reliable operations of the country's power grid.
For years, State Grid employees in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region have faced notable challenges in urban regions — tree barriers to urban line corridors, difficult maintenance, and unexpected power outages.
To address these challenges, the State Grid Xinjiang Electric Power Co introduced live-line operation robots in July 2022 that are designed to reduce power safety hazards by trimming and removing tree barriers without interruption to the power supply.
Mi Pengpeng, who is in charge of the live-line operation team at State Grid Xinjiang Electric Power, said, ""Using robots to replace traditional live-line operations has greatly improved the quality and efficiency of obstacle clearance while reducing the safety risks and intensity of live-line operations.""
After achieving new breakthroughs in projects such as attaching the ground ring to the robot, installing bird repellents, and disconnecting drain lines, the company actively explored the integration of live-line operation robots with laser-clearing devices.
After nine months of experimentation and through joint efforts of the innovation team, they raised the power of a traditional laser gun from 500W to 1,500W, achieving an improved parallel, fast, and precise cutting effect within 3 meters.
In just two minutes, a 10 cm tree trunk can be split in half, raising work efficiency by 11.5 times, Mi said, adding that this effectively resolves the long-standing difficulty faced by frontline personnel in clearing tree obstacles.
The application of this innovative technology on live-line operation robots by the State Grid Xinjiang employees was also a first in China, he said.
Xu Chen, Mi's colleague, noted that so far this year, the company has used live-line operation robots nearly 100 times, clearing nearly 260 tree barriers using the ""robot + laser blade"" technology.
Xu said that in the next stage, the company will continue to explore new technologies for intelligent distribution network replacements, gradually realizing the application of robot operations in more distribution network scenarios without power interruption, and accelerating the pace of intelligent distribution network replacements.

Chinese scientists unveil neural mechanisms of sequence sorting in macaque monkeys' brain,2024-09-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0929/c90000-20224735.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists unveil neural mechanisms of sequence sorting in macaque monkeys' brain
 (Xinhua) 08:42, September 29, 2024
SHANGHAI, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- After a person memorizes a series of numbers, the numbers can be repeated in the correct order or in reverse. So, how does the brain sort a series of items in a specific order within short-term memory, or working memory?
To figure out the neural mechanisms of sequence sorting in working memory, Chinese scientists trained two macaque monkeys to perform a visuospatial delayed sequence-sorting task and conducted high-throughput electrophysiological recordings in the frontal cortex of the monkeys.
The research was carried out by a team led by Wang Liping, a researcher at the Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and their findings were published in the journal Science on Friday.
Memory can be divided into short-term memory and long-term memory. Images seen and words heard in people's daily lives are first stored as short-term memory and then processed through sorting, compression, forgetting, and other processes according to needs, said Wang.
According to the research, spatial locations in each rank were encoded in separate rank subspaces, depending on rule cues. They were swapped between the subspaces by using two extra temporary subspaces in two parallel operation steps.
Tian Zhenghe, a doctorate student at the center, said the process is not a simple direct exchange. Instead, each subspace recruits a temporary subspace to store information, and after its own information is cleared, it receives the information from the other via another temporary subspace.
Sequence sorting, the mental manipulation of multiple items with different ordinal ranks in working memory, is essential for everyday activities such as planning, navigation and speech, said Peter Stern, a senior editor at Science who handles research papers related to neuroscience and brain research.
""These findings are an important step in understanding the neural mechanisms of reasoning and planning,"" Stern commented in the editor's summary.
Friday's edition of the journal also published the findings of another team from the center, led by the CAS academician Pu Muming, which obtained single-cell spatial transcriptomic atlases of macaque, marmoset and mouse cerebella.

Some 16 varieties of highland barley and rapeseed totaling 520 grams have been sent into space for breeding experiments with the successful launch of China's first reusable satellite the Shijian-19, Xizang media reported on Saturday, noting that the move marks new progress in the construction of a key laboratory for plateau space breeding.
The Shijian-19 was placed into its preset orbit via a Long March-2D carrier rocket that lifted off at 6:30 pm on Friday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwestern China, according to the China National Space Administration.
Space breeding utilizes extreme space environments such as microgravity and strong radiation to induce genetic mutations in the seeds. The seeds will be returned to Earth after a period of time, for the selection and breeding of new plant varieties. This process usually induces better-performing seeds.
The world's first key laboratory for plateau space breeding was established in Cona, Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region in May 2024 under the coordination of research teams in East China's Anhui Province and Northwest China's Shaanxi Province with the local Cona government. The lab is committed to contributing to the development of new agricultural productivity in Xizang and enhancing border security and prosperity, the Xizang Daily reported on Saturday.
This project is dedicated to space breeding work for local agricultural varieties in the plateau region, promoting the breeding research of local barley, Tibetan medicine, chili peppers, rapeseed, and other varieties. It also focuses on researching germplasm resources suitable for high-altitude, cold, and arid areas, including forage, ecological grass, Tibetan medicine, and fruits and vegetables.
Currently, the first phase of the plateau space forage selection and experimental base has been completed, with 30 acres planted with six varieties of space forage. As of early July this year, it has entered the stage of field management for experimental data monitoring. Subsequent research projects will be gradually established starting in 2025.

CHONGQING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- The China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) unveiled the exterior design of the country's moon-landing spacesuit for the first time on Saturday, soliciting its name from the public.
Displayed on the third Spacesuit Technology Forum hosted by the China Astronaut Research and Training Center in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, the white moon-landing spacesuit is decorated with red stripes.
The red stripes on its upper limbs are inspired by ribbons from the famous ""flying apsaras"" of Dunhuang art, while those on its lower limbs resemble rocket launch flames.
According to a video released by the CMSA, the spacesuit is made from protective materials that can effectively shield astronauts from the lunar thermal environment and lunar dust. It is equipped with a multifunctional integrated control panel that is easy to operate, as well as cameras for recording close-up and long-distance scenes.
The spacesuit also features flexible and reliable gloves, a panoramic glare-proof helmet visor, and joints adapted for low-gravity environments. The overall design of the spacesuit is lightweight, suitable for activities on the lunar surface.
Astronauts Zhai Zhigang and Wang Yaping serve as models for the new lunar suit in the video. Clad in the lunar gear, they perform a variety of movements, including walking, squatting, bending over, kneeling on one knee, and climbing a ladder.
According to Li Meng from the China Astronaut Research and Training Center, the development of the moon-landing spacesuit was started in 2020, aiming to produce lightweight, compact, highly reliable and safe lunar suits. The development has made many key technological breakthroughs.
China's first and second generations of Feitian extravehicular spacesuits have supported 17 astronauts in completing 17 extravehicular activities, ensuring the construction and efficient operation of the country's space station, according to Liu Dongyue from the center.
Zhai made history in the Shenzhou-7 mission as China's first person to conduct a spacewalk. He is also a crew member for the Shenzhou-13 mission.
Wang is a crew member for the Shenzhou-10 and the Shenzhou-13 missions and the first woman astronaut who has entered China's space station.
China has initiated the lunar landing phase of its manned lunar exploration program, with a plan of manned lunar landing by 2030. The unveiling of the moon-landing spacesuit marks the achievement of the program, and signifies the new stage of the country's spacesuit technology.

Computing empowers medical services, disaster warning capabilities
 (Xinhua) 14:59, September 27, 2024
CHANGSHA, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- When someone with an emotional issue or mental illness struggles with the idea of seeing a therapist in person, there is now another option: speaking to an artificial intelligence (AI) therapist through a WeChat mini program.
The AI therapist can answer questions about mental health, conduct mental health assessments and judge a person's emotional state by capturing facial expressions with the camera on the mobile phone. It was presented at the two-day 2024 World Computing Conference held this week in Changsha, the capital of central China's Hunan Province.
""The AI therapist will reply accordingly with its diagnosis and recommendations, speaking in an appropriate tone that should help comfort the person,"" said Yu Min, executive dean of the innovation research institute of Hunan Trasen Science & Technology Corp., Ltd., developer of the AI medical system.
People can also reach out to an AI doctor that can diagnose users after they describe their symptoms. It can also carry out traditional Chinese medicine tongue diagnosis and provide recipes and exercise recommendations to achieve improved balance and harmony within the body.
""Traditional models cannot meet the need to develop such systems in medical services, which require a high level of accuracy. However, fast-developing computing power has provided us with strong support to develop this medical system in a more accurate way,"" Yu said.
According to Pan Yunhe, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, new models are expected to help us become more knowledgeable and work toward preventive treatments for diseases in the coming years if data gathered from physical examinations, disease cases, families and regions is combined.
With extreme weather events increasing in frequency, computing power also has a huge role to play in the prevention and control of natural disasters.
Thanks to a disaster monitoring and early warning platform, six households in Dayingang Village, Hunan's Changde City, were able to relocate before a landslide occurred due to a week of rainfall in June.
The platform, developed by Hunan BDS Micro-chipset Data Technology Co., Ltd., is able to capture subtle changes in mountains by deploying high-precision monitoring equipment and sensors based on the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, said Long Pengyu, the company's deputy general manager.
""The platform can analyze the monitoring data to determine the mountain's status and predict natural disasters such as mudslides and landslides more than three hours in advance of their occurrence,"" he said.
The prevention of geological disasters such as landslides is an important task during the flood season in Hunan. Landslides develop quickly in extreme weather, and early warnings can now be sent via radio and text messages to help residents relocate in advance to avoid deaths, injuries and financial losses, Long added.
To date, the monitoring and early warning platform has been applied in more than 10 provinces in China.
""With accelerating technological innovation and algorithm improvement, we now have better warning results and accuracy levels. As a developer, we're also making efforts to reduce costs so that the platform can be used over a wider range and benefit more residents,"" he said.
The scale of China's computing industry reached 2.6 trillion yuan (about 370 billion U.S. dollars) in 2022, according to official statistics.

Prospering telemedicine a reflection of China's rapid internet development
By Jin Xin, Ni Yi (People's Daily) 10:43, September 27, 2024
A 5G ultra-remote robotic liver tumor resection surgery was recently completed, with the surgeon in east China's Zhejiang province and the patient in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region nearly 5,000 kilometers away.
The surgeon, from a surgical control station, operated robotic arms skillfully, and the robotic arms, upon receiving the commands, precisely executed various surgical tasks.
So far, hospitals in Zhejiang have completed over 50 such 5G ultra-remote robotic surgeries for patients in Xinjiang.

A remote group consultation is carried out between a hospital in Aksu, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital in east China's Zhejiang province. (Photo from the official account of the command center of Zhejiang province's paired assistance program for Xizang autonomous region's Nagqu on WeChat)
In recent years, telemedicine and digital healthcare have rapidly developed in China, safeguarding public health and vividly illustrating how information technology promotes equitable public services and fosters inclusive development of the internet.
In 2010, Zhejiang started offering paired assistance for Xinjiang's Aksu region and the First Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.
Since then, leveraging network communication technology, doctors from Zhejiang have implemented remote consultations and transmitted medical images, among other healthcare initiatives.
""Back then, the idea of performing remote surgeries on patients in Xinjiang using robots from Zhejiang seemed like a fantasy,"" recalled a doctor aiding Xinjiang.
According to Li Zheyong, vice president of Alaer Hospital in Xinjiang, which supervised by the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, communication technology is key to remote robotic surgery.
""Generally speaking, the network delay during a surgery should not exceed 300 milliseconds, and it must not be interrupted,"" Li said.
In recent years, mobile communication technologies such as 5G have rapidly advanced, and the infrastructure for network communication has continually improved.
As of 2023, China accounted for 42 percent of the world's essential patents for 5G standards. The country has built a total of over 3.37 million 5G base stations, and its computing power ranked second in the world. This largest and most advanced 5G network has made it possible to transcend geographical limitations.
In 2023, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital completed a 5G ultra-remote robotic cholecystectomy for a patient in Xinjiang, the first of its kind in China. The surgery utilized the country's first four-arm laparoscopic robot that employs 5G technology for ultra-remote operations, whose core software and hardware were all developed by Chinese teams.

Experts from Shanghai Chest Hospital removes a lung tumor for a patient in Kashgar, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region via a domestically produced 5G remote surgical robot, July 13. (Photo provided by the Second People's Hospital of Kashgar Prefecture)
Recently, on a desert road in Alaer city, administered by the First Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a car accident took place, leading to multiple fractures of a man.
Soon after the accident took place, a doctor from a nearby health clinic arrived at the site. Lacking experience in emergency care, the doctor was concerned that improper handling could jeopardize the man's recovery.
Thanks to a pair of specially designed augmented reality (AR) glasses the doctor took, which was enabled by the 5G technology, he received guidance from experienced experts, who were observing the patient through the glasses in real time.
""The 5G + AR remote diagnosis and treatment system extends high-quality medical care to the primary level,"" said Cai Xiujun, president of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital.
The application of internet technology in the healthcare sector is helping urban and rural areas better share quality medical resources, and it's not just in Xinjiang. The remote medical service network now covers all cities and counties in China and is extending to the primary level in communities and rural regions. Approximately 70 percent of primary-level clinics nationwide have established remote medical collaboration with higher-level hospitals.
The rapid advancement of the internet and the ongoing digitalization efforts are bridging the ""digital divide"" between urban and rural areas at an unprecedented pace, enhancing the accessibility and equality of basic public services.
""Now, tests done in cities can also have their results viewed back in rural hospitals; it’s truly convenient,"" said Tulfjang, a Xinjiang patient with chronic illness.
With the support from the medical teams assisting Xinjiang, Aksu region and the First Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps are gradually establishing a chronic disease management system that covers regional, county, township, and village levels, promoting patient information sharing, mutual recognition of testing data, and standardized management.
This integration of information goes beyond healthcare. Interconnected data improves the efficiency of government and public services, allowing more people to genuinely benefit from the digital dividends brought by technology.

Leading U.S. glaciologist returns to Xizang reflecting on remarkable changes
 (Xinhua) 09:53, September 27, 2024
LHASA, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Describing his relationship with Chinese scientists as ""like brothers"", Lonnie Thompson, a member of the American Academy of Sciences and a foreign academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has returned to the highest county in China 24 years after his last visit.
In the Shuanghu County of southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, where the average altitude exceeds 5,000 meters, he is working with Chinese scientists to uncover the secrets of Earth.
Located roughly 90 km northeast of the county seat, the Purog Kangri Glacier stands as the largest accumulation of ice outside the polar regions. In September, Thompson and academician Yao Tandong of the Chinese Academy of Sciences arrived there to conduct the second scientific expedition on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Their research primarily focused on crucial ice core drilling.
""It's really striking to go back and see these places that we drilled early in my career. I want to continue documenting the changes we observe in these glaciers."" At 76 and having undergone heart transplant surgery, Thompson expressed his excitement despite facing harsh environmental conditions and physical discomfort.
This visit is part of a scientific expedition to investigate the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, known as Asia's ""water tower"". The target region encompasses ""one glacier, two lakes and three rivers"" and is part of the second scientific expedition and research of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, which was initiated by China in August 2017. The goal is to understand the mechanism of environmental change and provide scientific support for the ecological security of the plateau.
The region is home to Purog Kangri Glacier, as well as Siling Lake and Namtso Lake, the largest and second-largest lakes in Xizang. It is also the birthplace of three big rivers in China, namely the Yangtze River, Nujiang River and Yarlung Zangbo River.
Noting that this expedition is significantly in larger scale and more comprehensive, Thompson reflected on his first visit to Purog Kangri in September 2000.
""Getting here was not easy back then. The road was muddy. Because the trucks were heavily laden with gear, and then we actually had to bring a road that we could lay down in front of the truck, so they wouldn't sink in the mud,"" he recalled. ""We worked hard to push and pull trying to just get to the site. But this year's experience is totally different. Paved road all the way here, brand-new hotel and the research base is fully equipped.""
In October that year, the research team successfully drilled their first ice core, reaching a depth of 118.55 meters, followed by two additional cores at the depths of 213 meters and 154 meters.
""Ice cores are crucial for understanding climate and environmental changes. Glaciers worldwide are retreating, and once they melt, the historical records they hold will disappear. Therefore, preserving these ice cores is vital. They serve as archives, allowing us to extract historical information even as new technologies emerge,"" Thompson emphasized, hoping this drilling will yield the longest and oldest ice cores from mid-latitude regions.
The Purog Kangri Glacier occupies a unique position in glaciology. ""The conditions of these glaciers are much different than we find in the polar regions or deeper in the tropics, and they are so important for the water resources, for the people who live downstream,"" he said. ""Understanding what the climate history was in this region and then how it fits into the global picture is extremely important. I think the international collaboration is the only way we can do this.""
Thompson first visited China in 1984, where he began a scientific collaboration with Yao Tandong and other Chinese scholars. Over the past four decades, they have drilled ice cores in various glaciers across China and published their findings in prestigious journals like Science, while also advancing the Third Pole Environment (TPE) program.
""We have built a solid scientific foundation over our 40 years of collaboration, establishing trust and viewing each other as brothers. This relationship is our most valuable asset in scientific research and cooperation,"" Thompson said.
He also expressed optimism about the future of glaciology in China. He recalled that 40 years ago when he first arrived in China, there was only one glacial station, and the quality, the level of scientific research were very low. ""But over the last 40 years, the investments that the Chinese governments made into glaciology have been tremendous.""
""The achievements of the past 40 years in China are remarkable,"" he continued. ""For me, the best scenario is when the world achieves a win-win situation, where we all benefit from cooperation, explore new fields, and deepen our understanding of climate science. This is how we make progress.""
""China plays a very important role in the future. And I really appreciate the amount of investment the governments made in science here in China over the last 40 years. I wish I saw that in every country around the world,"" he concluded. ""In the future, I want to continue documenting the changes we observe in these glaciers.""

Chinese researchers isolate anti-HIV antibody from alpacas,2024-09-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0926/c90000-20223527.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers isolate anti-HIV antibody from alpacas
 (Xinhua) 10:16, September 26, 2024
NANJING, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has isolated an antibody from alpacas that can effectively inhibit HIV, providing a promising avenue for the development of new anti-AIDS drugs.
The findings were recently published in the international academic journal Nature Communications.
Antiretroviral therapy is currently the primary clinical approach to inhibiting HIV replication, according to Wu Zhiwei, professor at the School of Medicine, Nanjing University.
While this treatment effectively extends the lifespan of patients, it may lead to significant drug resistance in the virus. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new therapies, said Wu, who is also a co-corresponding author of the research.
The primary approach in the clinical development of new anti-AIDS drugs targets the process by which the virus enters host cells. In this process, a receptor known as CD4 acts as a ""doorknob,"" which the virus utilizes to open the cell's ""door.""
The researcher team isolated thousands of CD4 nanobodies (a smaller, more stable type of antibody) from alpacas, of which Nb457 showed the potential to inhibit HIV.
They built a series of pseudoviruses to simulate 117 HIV strains and caused them to interact with Nb457.
The results showed that Nb457 effectively inhibited 116 virus strains, showing good broad-spectrum and antiviral activity.
In true virus tests, the trimeric nanobodies engineered from Nb457 have demonstrated potent inhibition of HIV, said Wu Xilin, a researcher at the School of Medicine, Nanjing University, another co-corresponding author of the research.
The results of mice experiments also showed that the virus was almost undetectable in the treated mice, and no drug-resistant mutations were found, Wu said.
HIV mutates rapidly and is prone to drug resistance, leading to a decline in drug efficacy, according to Wu.
The newly discovered antibody does not target the virus itself but the ""doorknob"" CD4, making it less likely to induce drug resistance in the virus and offering significant implications for the development of new anti-AIDS drugs and clinical treatment, Wu said.

China launched the construction of the testing prototype for the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) Core Array on Wednesday, aiming to greatly enhance the astronomical observation capability of the FAST telescope.
At 10:30 am, a 40-meter aperture antenna started to be installed on a hilltop less than three kilometers away from the current FAST site, also known as the China Sky Eye, located in a naturally deep and round karst depression in Southwest China's Guizhou Province.
In order to further raise FAST's scientific observation capability, the team behind the project proposed a low-cost, quickly implementable plan for a radio telescope array. According to this plan, the well-suited electromagnetic environment within 5 kilometers surrounding FAST will be fully utilized to construct 24 fully rotatable 40-meter-diameter antennas, which will function as a synthesis aperture array when combined with FAST, known as the FAST Core Array, according to CCTV.
Adding auxiliary telescopes around FAST is equivalent to turning FAST into a telescope with a much larger aperture, which will raise the observation capability of FAST, Zhu Weiwei, a researcher from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), explained, CCTV reported.
When the FAST Core Array is completed, it will significantly improve the ""eyesight"" of the China Sky Eye by allowing it not only to see far but also with a higher degree of clarity, said Jiang Peng, deputy director of the National Astronomical Observatories of the CAS, noting that the FAST Core Array functions are similar to a high-resolution ""digital camera"" that captures the distant starry sky, according to Xinhua.
The FAST Core Array will significantly expand the existing scientific research fields. In particular, it will play a major role in areas such as gravitational wave events, fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and black hole tidal disruption events. In addition to astrophysics research, the FAST Core Array can also play a role in deep space exploration fields such as near-Earth object early warning and deep space satellite communications, providing important strategic support for the development of China's aerospace sector.
FAST is the world's largest single-dish and the most sensitive radio telescope. Since it started operation, FAST has achieved numerous significant original breakthroughs in multiple areas in the discovery of pulsars, fast radio bursts, and nanohertz gravitational waves.

China starts building first high-voltage AC/DC hybrid power grid project
 (Xinhua) 09:36, September 26, 2024
NANJING, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday started the construction of its first high-voltage alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) hybrid power grid project in Jiangsu Province, marking another step toward a cleaner, safer and more efficient energy system.
The demonstration project will connect the two cities of Huai'an and Danyang, adding approximately 228 km of DC transmission lines to the existing power grid with two ±200 kV converter stations to be built at both ends, according to the State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd.
The project is expected to be operational after completion in 2026.
China's current main power grid is primarily composed of AC power grids. However, compared with AC transmission, DC transmission at the same voltage level can transmit larger amounts of power with lower energy losses.
Once operational, the project will significantly alleviate the pressure on north-to-south power transmission in Jiangsu and enhance grid flexibility, further expanding the application of hybrid grid technologies and helping develop a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy system, according to the company.
China recently issued a plan to promote advanced technologies in key energy fields, including hybrid AC/DC power grids.

BEIJING, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Searching for dark matter and black holes; taking high-definition images of the Earth; monitoring fires, earthquakes and mudslides, these are just a few tasks supported by the data from some 50 Chinese scientific and Earth observation satellites currently in orbit.
Day and night, huge volumes of data pours into China's satellite ground stations, which serve as space-ground information ports.
In recent years, China's rapid development of the space industry has significantly increased demand for satellite data reception. According to Li Tong, deputy director of the China Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station and senior engineer at the Aerospace Information Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's remote sensing satellite ground stations play an important role in advancing scientific research and supporting industrial applications.
Over three decades, China has built an operational system of remote sensing satellite ground stations. Headquartered in Beijing, this network includes five ground stations in Miyun in suburban Beijing; Kashgar in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Sanya on south China's island province of Hainan; Lijiang in southwest China's Yunnan Province; and Mohe, China's northernmost city.
Currently, the system boasts 38 large-diameter data receiving antennas and multiple high-speed fiber-optic data transmission links, enabling real-time data reception across the totality of China's territory, said Li.
These ground stations support data reception for all civil land observation and space science satellites. Since 1986, they have managed data for more than 70 domestic and international satellite missions, amassing over 600 terabytes of historical data.
The stations have been crucial for various national projects, including land surveys, ecological monitoring, and forest assessments. They also play a key role in disaster response, by providing timely data acquisition and monitoring during major natural disasters both domestically and abroad.
In 2023 alone, the ground stations delivered rapid mapping and data services for significant disasters in 16 countries, including Türkiye, Syria, New Zealand, and Peru, processing more than 1.2 terabytes of data from 22 domestically produced satellites.
Looking ahead, the ground stations plan to enhance their remote sensing information engineering by exploring intelligent data processing, and offering multi-resolution and diversified data product services, Li said.
