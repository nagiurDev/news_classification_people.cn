BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists recently discovered a binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and a hot subdwarf. The two stars were monitored orbiting each other at a record-breaking speed.
They are poised to generate strong gravitational wave radiation in the milli-Hertz frequency, which is expected to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.
The discovery made by Professor Wang Xiaofeng's team at Tsinghua University and his collaborators by using the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS), located at the Xinglong Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatories in north China's Hebei Province, was published online in Nature Astronomy on Friday.
The team discovered a very unique 20.5-minute orbital-period binary system, known as TMTS J0526, about 2,760 light years from Earth. The system harbors a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star and a low-mass subdwarf B star with a mass of only 0.33 solar mass.
The hot subdwarf of the TMTS J0526 system has a radius only seven times that of Earth, representing the star with the smallest volume ever known, said Lin Jie, a key member of the research team.
""This discovery has identified an important source for future space-based gravitational wave detection. It verifies the theoretical prediction of the formation of such a special binary system proposed by the team of Han Zhanwen, an academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences, from the Yunnan Observatory in 2003,"" Wang Xiaofeng said.
""This discovery can help us better understand and improve the theory of star evolution, which is the cornerstone of our understanding of the evolution of the universe,"" he added.
The TMTS is a uniquely designed multi-telescope optical survey instrument established by Wang's team with the support from Ma Huateng Foundation and Tsinghua University.
Since it went into operation in 2020, the TMTS has been scanning the northern celestial hemisphere with a cadence of about one minute.
By the end of 2023, TMTS has accumulated photometric data for over 27 million stars, which includes dozens of valuable short-period variable sources. Among them, TMTS J0526 stands out as one of the sources with the shortest period.

Yan's ascent to internet fame began in July 2022 after a video uploaded by his father went viral. In the video, Yan adeptly pointed out inaccuracies in the depiction of a rocket in an educational film at a planetarium in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region.
The planetarium acknowledged Yan's sharp observation and promptly corrected the errors in their educational film.
On Aug. 24, 2022, Yan had the opportunity to meet Zhang Yuhua, a notable figure in China's space exploration efforts. It was on this day that he expressed his ambition to build his own rocket.
From August 2022 to June 2023, Yan dedicated 10 months to researching, studying, doing experiments, and successfully building his first rocket.
However, upon launch, the rocket started to fall after traveling 200 meters, failing to deploy its parachute, Yan's father recounted, noting that Yan was dissatisfied with the result.

BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- China launched the construction of an innovative platform for molecular imaging and theranostic medical probes in Huairou Science City in the northeastern suburbs of Beijing on Wednesday, according to Peking University, which is leading the project.
The platform, with a planned construction area of 29,000 square meters and a total investment of approximately 630 million yuan (about 88.67 million U.S. dollars), is a key part of the multi-modal and multi-scale biomedical imaging project, one of the major national scientific and technological infrastructure, which was completed in Huairou Science City in 2022 and began trial operations last year, said Yang Zhi, a scientist at Peking University's National Biomedical Imaging Center.
The platform is scheduled to be put into operation in June 2026. Upon completion, it will help the full-function operation of imaging facilities and facilitate technology transformation. It will also be able to observe the entire process of disease occurrence with more precision as well as panoramically study and analyze major scientific issues in biomedicine.
Molecular imaging technology can decode the occurrence and development mechanism of diseases in real-time and in vivo from different scales of molecules, cells and tissue, and realize the visual diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It has shown great clinical significance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
The molecular probe is a tracer with specific biological targeting properties, which is the key to the function of biomedical imaging facilities, and is also the core technology and international research frontier in the field of molecular imaging.
According to Yang, the platform comprises four experimental sub-platforms, namely, in vivo chemistry and probe technology, biological imaging probes, multi-modal imaging probes, and medical diagnostic probes, alongside a public lab sub-platform.
The primary objective is to establish a comprehensive innovation system for imaging probes, fostering the development of innovative probes, their commercialization, and market exploitation, advancing their clinical application, and establishing a hub for probe innovative research and development as well as a talent center, Yang said.

"Global forum on AI addresses ethics, sovereignty concerns",2024-02-07,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0207/c90000-20132272.html,"Home>>
		
Global forum on AI addresses ethics, sovereignty concerns
 (Xinhua) 16:31, February 07, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The Global Forum on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 2024, under the patronage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), was held on Monday and Tuesday, addressing crucial themes such as equality and diversity in the rapidly advancing field of digital technology.
In the past year, countries worldwide have been actively engaged in AI development tailored for local languages, reflecting their profound considerations in the domain of digital sovereignty.
EMERGENCE OF DIVERSE AI MODELS
In late 2022, the release of the English generative AI ChatGPT by the U.S.-based company OpenAI sparked a global trend in developing generative AI models for local languages.
Notably, in China, models like Baidu's ERNIE Bot and iFlytek's Xinghuo have undergone rapid iterations, showcasing impressive Chinese language-processing capabilities and serving as productivity tools for many businesses.
""China has made rapid progress in relevant research, with some cross-domain large models achieving breakthroughs, and the development trend of large models for vertical domains is also very promising,"" Chen Xiaoping, chairman of the AI Ethics Committee of the Chinese Artificial Intelligence Association, told Xinhua.
The generative AI landscape is also thriving in Europe. In France, by September of the previous year, 79 startups were already specializing in the field. Notably, Mistral, an AI company valued at almost 2 billion euros (around 2.15 billion U.S. dollars), stands out for introducing the versatile ""Mixtral8x7B"" model proficient in French, Spanish, Italian, English, and German.
In Russia, YandexGPT said it outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 in Russian language responses and has passed the Russian Unified State Exam.
Simultaneously, countries like Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Singapore are actively participating in the development of generative AI models tailored to their respective languages.
BUILDING SOVEREIGN AI CAPABILITIES
This global trend not only underscores the dynamic evolution of generative AI across diverse linguistic landscapes, but also highlights the growing significance of ""sovereign AI"" worldwide.
""Sovereign AI"" is a frequently mentioned concept in the wake of the popularity of generative AI. It generally refers to a country's support for AI infrastructure development, training large models with data that align with the country's culture and thinking, and fostering a local ecosystem for AI products.
People and countries now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, process that data, and develop their own AI, said Nvidia Corp chief executive Jensen Huang.
Last year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire publicly stated that France and Europe at large must develop their own generative AI. He pledged to increase the funds raised to invest in tech innovation.
Similar concerns have been voiced by various countries, including India.
""We are determined that we must have our own sovereign AI,"" Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Indian minister of state for electronics and information technology, said recently.
""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them,"" Huang said.
Such words underscore a significant challenge in developing sovereign AI globally.
Currently, American enterprises dominate the field of AI, and for other countries to keep pace, they must adopt American products, and such dependence could potentially constrain their subsequent development.
Against this backdrop, data analysis experts caution that the predominant use of English in building AI language models, coupled with most suppliers originating from the United States, may result in a heavy reliance on American providers, leading to a lack of full independence in many AI technologies.
TACKLING POTENTIAL DIGITAL DIVIDE
The global development of generative AI is uneven, potentially leading to new inequalities.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting earlier this year: ""We need a systematic effort to increase access to AI so that developing economies can benefit from its enormous potential. We need to bridge the digital divide instead of deepening it.""
Chen pointed out that for the new problems arising in the era of AI, it is necessary to pursue a unity of economic and social benefits while maintaining high-quality development, to effectively ensure and improve the well-being of society and mankind as a whole.
In this process, China has shown good momentum in the field of AI.
Ronnie Lins, director of the China-Brazil Center for Research and Business, told reporters in April last year that Brazil's AI development is not yet sufficient, while China and the United States have invested heavily in AI.
AI could have an impact on jobs globally, Lins noted, expecting China to leverage its strengths and contribute to creating new opportunities for young people through the application of new technologies.
The Global Forum on the Ethics of AI 2024 addressed the aforementioned issues. In the current landscape of diverse language AI developments, Gabriela Ramos, assistant director-general for the Social and Human Sciences of UNESCO, emphasized the need for global cooperation.
""We need true global coordination and knowledge-sharing to build a responsible AI ecosystem that benefits everyone,"" said Ramos.

Experts see broad prospects for China-Brazil aerospace cooperation
 (Xinhua) 11:07, February 07, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- China and Brazil plan to jointly develop new earth-resource satellites and continue to promote the construction of the BRICS Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation, showing broad prospects for aerospace cooperation between the two countries, according to experts.
Over the past 30 years, China and Brazil have achieved fruitful results in the China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite (CBERS) project, space experts from the two countries said at the China Brazil Space Cooperation Symposium held by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) in Beijing on Monday.
CBERS has become the longest and most influential international cooperation project in the field of aerospace, and is a model of ""South-South cooperation,"" the experts said.
Ma Shijun, CBERS Project Mission Manager, said that in 1988, the two countries signed an agreement to jointly develop the CBERS project, sharing the cost and separately developing its systems. Both sides had advantages and they were highly complementary, Ma said.
In 1999, the first China-Brazil earth-resource satellite was successfully launched, giving China its first transmission-type remote sensing satellite. It was the first satellite jointly developed by China and another country and was rated one of the top 10 scientific and technological advances of the year in China.
China and Brazil have jointly developed six earth-resource satellites, and CBERS-4 and CBERS-4A satellites are running well in orbit.
Data from the satellites has served the social and economic development of the two countries and is widely used in the fields of natural resources, agriculture, forestry, geology, water resources, urban planning and environmental protection.
The satellites have also helped monitor global disasters such as forest fires, floods, earthquakes and tsunamis. Data from the satellites is provided to developing countries free of charge.
Jose Raimundo Coelho, former president of the Brazilian Space Agency, who participated in the symposium, was recently awarded the Friendship Award of the Chinese government in recognition of his outstanding contribution to promoting aerospace cooperation between China and Brazil.
The CBERS has met the needs of Brazil in exploring and monitoring natural resources, he said, adding that China-Brazil aerospace cooperation will become closer and closer.
He believes that, with the exchange and development of aerospace science and technology, more satellites will be launched.
The aerospace cooperation between China and Brazil is open, honest and equal, Ma said.
The two major developing countries have jointly carried out satellite design and final assembly testing, shared quality management and project management methods, and accumulated rich experience in research and development, which has improved their aerospace science and technology level, he said.
China and Brazil signed a supplementary protocol between the two governments in Beijing last April, stipulating that the two countries will jointly develop and launch the CBERS-6 satellite.
The CNSA said the aerospace cooperation between China and Brazil will benefit the people of the two countries, contribute to the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

Chinese tech firms thrive on innovation
By Lia Zhu (China Daily) 10:34, February 06, 2024

Visitors try products at the BOE Technology booth during the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Jan 9. ZENG HUI/XINHUA
Chinese consumer electronics companies are stepping up their innovative strategies, fueled by a deep commitment to research and development and a growing focus on creative business models.
Companies like BOE Technology, a leading Chinese display panel manufacturer, exemplify this transformation.
""Technological innovation is the foundation and soul of BOE,"" Si Da, the company's vice-president and chief brand officer, told China Daily.
The company entered the semiconductor display industry in 2003. In just 20 years, it has become a global leader in the display industry. Si attributed the rapid growth to its commitment to technological innovation.
BOE ranked 15th among the most innovative companies in the US last year, according to a report released last month by IFI Claims Patent Services, which tracks patent applications and grant data.
""This is the sixth consecutive year that BOE has ranked in the list's top 20,"" Si said in an interview during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month.
The company filed more than 90,000 new patent applications in 2023, more than 90 percent for inventions and over 33 percent for overseas patents. Behind the impressive patent portfolio is the R&D investment exceeding 7 percent of annual revenue with the R&D personnel accounting for 23 percent of the total workforce.
This dedication is echoed by Hisense USA, the fastest-growing TV brand in the US market. ""Consumers are recognizing the quality of our products and willing to pay more for it,"" David Gold, president of Hisense USA, told China Daily.
This shift in consumer perception is driven by Hisense's focus on R&D centers in both the US and China, ensuring they cater to local preferences while leveraging Chinese innovation expertise.
""The continuous investment in R&D is our engine of growth,"" said Gold, ""There's continuous investment in R&D from our headquarters in China.""
Looking at the Chinese companies participating in the CES in recent years, it is clear they are increasingly relying on quality and technology to win, said Liu Chun, vice-president of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products.
""They have reached the consensus that it is difficult to win by competing on price. This is a marked shift from the past when Chinese companies were often seen as low-cost competitors,"" she told China Daily.
Eye on expansion
This focus on innovation isn't just a corporate strategy. It reflects a broader shift among Chinese companies that have set their sights on global expansion.
Innovators based in China filed around 1.58 million patent applications in 2022, accounting for nearly half of the global patent applications and exceeding that of the US, according to a November report by the World Intellectual Property Organization.
The organization saw the highest volume of filing activity from China and sees China as the ""main driver of global growth"". In fields like solar cells and electric vehicle powertrain batteries, China has emerged as the largest source for patents, both applied and granted.
Rebecca Fannin, founder of Silicon Dragon Ventures, observed a significant shift. ""We have seen the shift of copying from the US to China innovating on its own terms, and now taking some of these brands global,"" she said.
This shift is evident in areas like e-commerce and electric vehicles, where Chinese companies are ""getting ahead of the United States"", said Fannin at a recent webinar examining US-China innovation landscape.
""We definitely have seen this spread of Chinese technology innovation and also moving up the ladder to the creative aspect of it,"" she added.
Chinese companies aren't just innovating in technology; they're also redefining business models.
""The aspect of business model innovation can't be ignored. The Chinese have excelled at this,"" said Fannin. Examples include the separation of car sales from battery subscriptions in electric vehicles and targeting rural shoppers in e-commerce.

"Chinese researchers release AI governance index, with China ranking in first echelon",2024-02-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0206/c90000-20131527.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese researchers release AI governance index, with China ranking in first echelon
By Liu Caiyu and Chen Zishuai (Global Times) 10:08, February 06, 2024

Chinese researchers released an artificial intelligence (AI) governance index on Monday, which shows that the US and China are leading in terms of overall quantity in AI development and China ranks in the first echelon, second only to the US in terms of AI governance.
The AI Governance International Evaluation Index was jointly initiated by the Center for Long-term AI Research (CLAI) and the Center on AI Ethics and Governance of the Institute of Automation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Zeng Yi, the leading author and a professor at the Institute of Automation, told the Global Times any attempt to seek dominance and hegemony in the issues of AI ethics, safety, and governance would be a result of insufficient understanding of the risks brought by the development of AI, which humanity should face collectively.
Solving the problems of AI development and governance requires global collaboration, Zeng stressed.
The AGILE index is reportedly the world's first comprehensive quantitative assessment index specifically for AI governance. The index evaluates the level of governance of AI in 14 countries, including G7 member countries, BRICS member countries before the 2023 expansion (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), as well as Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
The AGILE index highlighted that countries with high risks in AI also have relatively high levels of governance, indicating that governance is a necessary driving force for development.
High-income countries are significantly ahead of BRICS countries in terms of AI development level and governance tools, and slightly ahead in terms of governance environment. However, BRICS countries have a slightly higher governance effectiveness than the high-income country group.
The better performance of BRICS countries in governance effectiveness is mainly due to their advantages in dimensions such as public trust, awareness, and inclusiveness in the development of AI, it showed.
The index also showed the per capita GDP level is strongly correlated with the AI governance level, Zeng noted.
Development is a premise for AI governance. The scores of China and India are significantly higher than their corresponding levels of per capita GDP, mainly due to the fact that the development level of AI in these two countries is higher than their per capita GDP levels, as well as their better performance in public awareness and trust in AI.
The index also shows that China, the US, and the UK are more advanced in terms of AI development and have achieved relatively good governance results. However, compared to other countries, they also face higher pressure and challenges in AI governance.
For China, Zeng believed that the country still needs to make up for shortcomings in computing power and data infrastructure, and to promote differentiated development in this field, especially by supporting innovative research and development institutions and start-up companies, in order to strengthen the original innovation of AI.
But at the same time, China also needs to be cautious about the risks posed by other countries internationally. It should learn from the experiences of other countries in development and regulation, and explore and implement governance practices that are in line with China's development philosophy and stage, according to Zeng.
International cooperation in the governance of AI is important. The AGILE Index shows that countries closely collaborate in research on AI governance, and all countries actively participate in it. Among them, China, the US, and the UK are one of the most closely cooperating country combinations in global AI governance research.
“No country can solve the development and governance issues of AI alone; global collaboration is needed,” Zeng told the Global Times.
However, at the recent Davos Forum, there were divergent opinions on the topic of global AI governance. According to US media reports, US White House officials stated that the US cautions against rival countries accessing US technology in matters of national security and military applications.
Věra Jourová, European Commission vice-president for values and transparency, once said at a Davos panel that China and Europe do not have a ""common language"" on AI governance issues, the FT reported.
Such a statement that China and the EU ""lack common language"" in AI governance clearly lacks common sense, Zeng noted.
The AGILE Index indicates that with the explosive growth of the application of large-scale AI models in 2023, the number of global AI risk events has increased 12 times compared to the previous year. Most of these risks are not only a crisis for one country; it is also difficult for one country to solve these problems alone.
Zeng stated that in the face of possible conflicts in values and differences in regulatory and governance models, it is possible to address these issues by establishing interfaces between policies of different countries and by respecting the development and governance sovereignty of each country.
In terms of ethical safety and governance of AI, it is necessary to support global governance of AI with the United Nations at its core, Zeng stressed.

Chinese scientists record solar plasmas to prevent space weather damage
 (Xinhua) 17:00, February 05, 2024
NANJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Using spectral imaging data of China's first solar exploration satellite, Xihe, a group of Chinese physicists constructed three-dimensional velocity diagrams of two kinds of plasmas in the sun's atmosphere.
The dark bands suspended in the corona are much colder and more dense than the surrounding matter, thus showing long dark bars against a bright background. When appearing in the edge of the sun's surface, they presented bright structures called prominence.
Xihe, a space telescope operating in a sun-synchronous orbit, is conducting the space exploration of solar Hα spectral imaging of the all-sun plane. It can scan the full heliosphere within 46 seconds, obtaining spectral information at any point on the sun and enabling the mapping of dark band dynamics.
Using Xihe's observations, the researchers from Nanjing University demonstrated the expansion, ejection, fallback, rotation and splitting of a dark bar and a solar prominence, according to a news release on Monday by the China National Space Administration.
The erupting dark bars, if spread towards the Earth, may trigger geomagnetic storms, causing serious damage to the equipment in the near-Earth space.
The accurate measurement of the three-dimensional velocity fields of those plasmas is of great significance for early warning and forecasting of catastrophic space weather, said the researchers.
