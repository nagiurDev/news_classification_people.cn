A new millisecond pulsar has been found through the collaboration of the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, and the ""Chinese sky-eye,"" the 500-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), which marks a new trial success for Chinese supercomputing in this field and will help expand research in modern physics theory.
The National Supercomputing Center in Jinan (known as ""Jinan Supercomputing"") in East China's Shandong Province and the joint research team from the local Qilu Normal University, utilizing the FAST, discovered a new millisecond pulsar named PSR J1810-0622, the Global Times learned from Jinan Supercomputing on Wednesday.
This millisecond pulsar has a rotation period of 4.55ms, and based on the Galactic electron density model (YMW16), it is estimated to be about 208 parsec from Earth. The research was conducted by the Jinan Supercomputing-FAST joint research team on the Shanhe Supercomputing platform.
It is the first major achievement of the joint research team from the National Astronomical Observatories, Qilu Normal University, and Jinan Supercomputing, and it is also the first millisecond pulsar discovered by FAST using entirely local research resources in the province of Shandong.
Pulsars are the remnants of massive stars that have died. Due to their rapid rotation, their electromagnetic signals fluctuate periodically, like a pulse.
The newly discovered pulsar, named J1810-0622, has a rotation period of 4.55 milliseconds and is about 678 light-years from Earth. The study of pulsars can aid in expanding research in modern physics theories, representing a competitive high ground in natural science for global technological powerhouses, the Global Times learned from Jinan Supercomputing.
To sift through such vast amounts of data to find traces of pulsars relies on high-speed computing systems. The National Supercomputing Center in Jinan is known as the ""strongest brain"" in the Yellow River basin, boasting large data storage capacity and high computational power.
Researchers from the National Astronomical Observatories and Jinan Supercomputing formed an interdisciplinary research and development team, using artificial intelligence and big data systems to develop signal filtering algorithms that optimize the extraction of data characteristic of pulsars.
The new algorithm shortens the time required 20-fold compared to traditional methods.
Guo Meng, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, stated that the coding workload might be five to 10 times more than that of the original programs. ""Only after proving its accuracy and efficiency would they employ it in the actual search process for pulsar satellites,"" he said.
In the future, Jinan Supercomputing will continue to deepen exchanges and cooperation with the National Astronomical Observatories, Qilu Normal University, and other parties. Focusing on scientific research, technological development, talent cultivation, public science outreach, and academic exchanges in the intersection of computing and astronomy, it will continuously support the innovative development of China's astronomy, according to Jinan Supercomputing.

China's domestically developed AG600M aircraft, a firefighting variant of the AG600 large amphibious aircraft family, has reportedly passed test under extreme cold weather, according to the aircraft developer Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). Chinese experts hailed the milestone verified the model's high reliability in harsh weather conditions, affirming its potential for a wide range of applications in the future.
On Tuesday, two AG600M large amphibious airplanes completed the cold-weather flight test at an airport in Hailar of Hulunbuir in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said AVIC, the country's leading aircraft manufacturer.
The flight test lasted around two weeks in a cold environment with temperature ranging from -20 C to - 40 C, which was a challenging setting to assess the aircraft's performance under low temperatures, frost and freezing conditions.
Wei Dongxu, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the flight test marks a significant milestone in China's aerospace technology.
These tests aimed to assess the aircraft's adaptability to complex environments, particularly in regions prone to icing conditions, Wei noted.
The successful deployment of the AG600M in such harsh conditions underscores its robustness and reliability, affirming its potential for a wide range of applications in the future, he said.
The expert also said that, with the successful test, the AVIC continues to demonstrate its prowess in manufacturing specialized aircraft, with the AG600M serving as a testament to the quality and resilience of Chinese engineering.
According to the AVIC, the recent flight tests were conducted to verify the functions and performance of the AG600M aircraft's major systems, including power, fuel, flight control and avionics, in cold environments.
Additionally, the tests have evaluated the aircraft's maintainability in low temperatures. The two AG600M airplanes undertook ferry flights, traveling approximately 2,000 kilometers in six hours from Northwest China's Shaanxi Province to Hailar Airport in late January.
This test marked the longest ferry flight mission completed by the aircraft and presented them with the most challenging route environment to date. AVIC said that cold-weather flight tests are crucial for obtaining airworthiness certification and gaining insights into the future operation and maintenance of the AG600M aircraft.
As the aircraft proves its mettle even in the most challenging environment, it opens up new avenues for China's aerospace sector, promising broader market opportunities on both domestic and international fronts, Chinese observers said.
The AG600M firefighting aircraft has entered the key phase of airworthiness compliance verification, and it is set to obtain the type certificate before the end of 2024, the developer added.
China's independently developed AG600 aircraft family is being developed as vital advanced aeronautical equipment to strengthen the country's emergency-rescue capabilities.
Codenamed Kunlong, or ""water dragon"" in Chinese, the AG600 aircraft family is being developed to serve various emergency rescue missions. It can be used in forest firefighting, maritime search and rescue, and other critical emergency rescue missions.
The AG600 series amphibious aircraft features a unique configuration consisting of an integrated aircraft-shaped upper body and ship-bottom-shaped lower body.
As a member of the AG600 family, the AG600M is specifically designed to combat forest fires. Its maximum take-off weight is 60 tons, with a water-carrying capacity of up to 12 tons and flight range of up to 4,500 kilometers. It can conduct low-altitude flying at low speed, enabling it to drop water accurately on fire sites, Global Times learned from the AVIC previously.

The recently released artificial intelligence model Sora, created by research organization OpenAI, has caused a sensation in the tech sector with its ability to generate videos of up to a minute in length based on brief text instructions.Some industry insiders said that Sora will bring revolutionary changes to content creation as well as the entertainment and education industries, while causing concern among regular workers about their future amid constantly improving AI technologies.The quickly changing situation has prompted some employees to adapt through proactive steps to use AI in their work.Generative AI, which allows enterprises to create new products more quickly, may become a major, uncontrollable factor in the job market, and experts and industry insiders are advising the average worker to gain more digital working skills.The online career networking platform LinkedIn said in a recent report that last year, generative AI affected more than 500 working skills worldwide, such as data analysis and visual content creation. The application of generative AI is projected to affect 65 percent of people's working skills by 2030, the report said.Yang Jing, 32, an illustrator in Beijing, said that she and her colleagues are worried about their future. ""We have been jittery since we watched online videos that showed AI tools being used to make superfast illustrations. News reports about AI replacing average workers in the near future are making us anxious.""She recalled that one of her friends who is an animator for a gaming company in Beijing almost lost her job last year. ""I can't say that AI has fundamentally changed our lives yet, but it is very likely to affect our careers in the future,"" she said.Yang's fears are not unfounded. Many employers are showing a growing interest in AI, and job seekers with AI working skills are likely to gain more interview invitations.According to recruitment portal Liepin, the number of job openings requiring AI-related skills rose by nearly 180 percent on the platform between January and October last year.Li Qiang, vice-president of Zhaopin, another recruitment portal, said the employment market is currently dynamic, with new professions emerging and old ones being replaced because of technological advancements.""Just like previous digital technology innovations replaced lower-level, low-wage workers, the advent of large language model AI tools has a substitution effect on white-collar jobs, or relatively high-paying, knowledge-based, high-income jobs,"" Li said.In July, Zhaopin and the National School of Development of Peking University jointly released a report that listed several professions expected to bear the brunt of AI, including financial auditing, interpretation and banking. On the other hand, workers involved in domestic services, catering and nursing face the lowest possibility of replacement.For the first time, the development of AI tools is threatening to replace high-paying, white-collar jobs, instead of the labor-intensive jobs that were affected during previous technological revolutions, according to the Zhaopin report.The report further indicated that China is not fully ready to adjust its job market or labor supply resources with the development of AI, and some skills or knowledge-based jobs have started to take a hit.To actively adapt to the changing job market, some employees — especially those born after 1995 — are making efforts to use AI in their daily work and turn the technological challenge into an advantage.According to a recent survey by Zhaopin, 69 percent of employees have tried to use AI tools such as ChatGPT in their daily work, while only 7.7 percent have never heard about such tools.""We need to see AI technology in a more objective and reasonable way, instead of panicking or worrying. What we average people need to do is embrace it with a positive attitude, and keep learning to strengthen our personal working abilities,"" said Li, the Zhaopin vice-president.""Digital technology may grow to become an essential working skill, like using office software, so we encourage job seekers to put in extra efforts to acquire more knowledge of digital and AI technologies,"" he said.""However, AI is not omnipotent, so job seekers and employees can enhance their 'soft skills', such as emotional competence, to make themselves more competitive in the market,"" he added.Yang, the illustrator, said that although AI has changed and will keep changing the industry, it cannot replace the human touch and personal improvisations in artwork.""We can neither overlook nor overestimate AI,"" she said. ""As humans, we have to be more diversified. Maybe AI will have emotions in the future, but as of now, it is just a tool serving people's needs. It is never wrong to keep learning.""

Brain-computer interface tech set to surge in China,2024-02-21,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0221/c90000-20135484.html,"Home>>
		
Brain-computer interface tech set to surge in China
By Zheng Yiran (China Daily) 09:59, February 21, 2024
The brain-computer interface in China is expected to develop rapidly, thanks to policy support, technological advancement and surging demand.With the ability to regulate brain functioning through stimulation, the interface is a frontier technology that could assist in rehabilitation of patients with brain diseases and injuries, and even expand the human brain's processing capability in the future.At Ruijin Hospital affiliated with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, surgery using a brain pacemaker with brain-computer interface function and multi-target combined stimulation to treat depression was successfully completed in 2020, the first of its kind in the world. The hospital recently spoke about the patient's successful recovery.The patient was 31-year-old Wu Xiaotian, who had been suffering from depression for 16 years. Depression often left his brain blank, and he was unable to express even simple greetings such as a ""hello"". At its worst, it left him lying motionless in bed all day.The external world seemed like a vacuum to him. ""It had nothing to do with me,"" he recalled.Today, Wu is a happy man. Now there is a neural regulatory device, known as a brain pacemaker, buried in his right chest cavity. It is connected to two electrodes, extending from the device in front of the chest to behind the ear, and then from the posterior brain to the anterior side of the brain, passing through the nerve nuclei at the front end of the brain. Electric stimulation of these nerves makes depressive symptoms disappear.He can crack jokes and talk to strangers without any hesitation. Fond of music, he starts humming when he is at a place that makes him happy.On Jan 28, the Elon Musk-backed neurotechnology company Neuralink announced that it had carried out its first brain chip implant.Other companies are developing similar interfaces to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities by enabling them to control prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs or other assistive devices directly with their thoughts. Some companies are working to use the technology to restore lost sensory or motor functions in individuals who have experienced paralysis, limb loss or the treatment of neurological conditions; and as a means of communication for individuals with conditions that limit their ability to speak or write.In fact, China has been exploring the technology for many years. Not only has it made breakthroughs in basic research, but it also has implemented practical applications in fields such as healthcare, education and entertainment.The country's emphasis on brain-computer interface technology is evident. As early as 2016, it announced the launch of the China Brain Project, or Brain Science and Brain-Like Intelligence Technology, where the interface played a key role, displaying enormous growth potential.""Currently, China's brain-computer interface industrial chain is not perfect, with some key features such as chips being the weak links. With policy support and technology advancement, the market scale of China's brain-computer interface segment is estimated to grow rapidly, and form a market worth 100 billion yuan ($13.9 billion),"" said Zhang Yue, chairman of AoYo International Media Beijing Co Ltd.Hong Yong, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation's e-commerce research institute, said: ""China's brain-computer interface development is a positive trend and has great growth potential. Although we are currently dependent on core technologies from overseas, the situation encourages domestic companies to enhance R&D capabilities, to explore core technologies on our own.""In the future, propelled by policy, capital and market demand, the brain-computer interface industry is expected to achieve the autonomy of key technologies and make commercial progress in multiple application scenarios such as healthcare, rehabilitation training, education and entertainment, and intelligent control.""To boost the development of the sector, Wang Peng, an associate research fellow at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, suggested that China should enhance independent R&D and innovation, improve relevant laws and regulations, promote the coordinated development of the industry, and increase market acceptance.

China contributes to Antarctic studies, protection over past 40 years
By Liu Shiyao, Hu Runxin (People's Daily) 14:36, February 20, 2024
China's Qinling Station started operation on Inexpressible Island in the Terra Nova Bay of Antarctica on Feb. 7.
Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter on the completion of the building of the Qinling Station and its operation in Antarctica. He said the completion of the building of the Qinling Station will provide a strong guarantee for scientists in China and around the world to continue to explore the mysteries of nature and bravely ascend the peak of science.

Antarctica has immense value for scientific research. It is hailed as the golden key to unlock the Earth's mysteries and a natural science laboratory.
Because of its distinctive geographical conditions and natural environment, changes in Antarctica will have incalculable impacts on the global climate and environment.
The Qinling Station is China's fifth research station in Antarctica, after the Great Wall, Zhongshan, Kunlun, and Taishan Stations. It is also China's third Antarctic research base to be operational throughout the year.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's polar expedition. Over the past 40 years, China has launched five stations and two research vessels for Antarctic research, entering an era of three-dimensional development across sea, land and air.
The Great Wall Station is located on King George Island, the Zhongshan Station in the Larsemann Hills, the Kunlun Station and Taishan Station in Antarctica's inland region, and the Qinling Station in the Ross Sea area. Their geographic differences exactly bring greater value to scientific research.
The region where the Great Wall Station is located is suitable for subantarctic ecological monitoring and research. The Zhongshan Station is an ideal place to observe and study the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet and the interactions between the ice shelf and the ocean. It is also an excellent location for research in aerophysics, geology, geophysics and other disciplines.
The Kunlun and Taishan stations in Antarctica's inland enable frontier research in ice core science, atmospheric science and astronomical science.
The Ross Sea region features interactions between the lithosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and atmosphere - different layers of the Earth system. This helps researchers investigate important scientific questions like how changes in Antarctica affect the whole world.
Over the past 40 years, China has become a driving force in Antarctic scientific exploration, achieving many breakthroughs in fields like glaciology, space science, bio-ecology, and climate change.
Countless ""firsts"" have marked the fruitful achievements of China's Antarctic expeditions.
The first Chinese Antarctic expedition team conducted the first multidisciplinary field scientific survey near the Great Wall Station.

During the 19th Chinese Antarctic expedition, China tracked and monitored changes in the thickness of Antarctic sea ice for the first time in the world.
The 21st expedition team entered the area of the Dome Argus (Dome A), the peak of Antarctica's inland icecap, and carried out substantive scientific investigations, for the first time in the history of Antarctic research.
In recent years, China has conducted continuous observations of the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, glaciers, soil, bio-ecology and other elements of Antarctica. This has made important contributions to the international community's understanding of the polar regions, especially the interaction between global climate change and Antarctica.
Over the past 40 years, China has always been an active contributor to environmental protection in Antarctica.
In early September 1990, the Great Wall Station temporarily halted the use of all vehicles and required staff to walk on foot, in order to ensure a good environment for seals around the station during their pregnancy and following childbirth.
At the 31st Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in 2008, the Antarctic Specially Protected Area around Mount Harding in the middle of the Grove Mountains proposed by China was approved. As the first Antarctic Specially Protected Area independently proposed by China, it has made positive contributions to environmental protection in the region.
China's first independently built polar icebreaker, the Xuelong 2, is a well-deserved ""green"" vessel. From the control of exhaust emissions, sewage and waste discharge, to real-time regulation of air conditioning and heating, and even the use of paints, all are in strict compliance with environmental requirements.
Environmental protection was also integrated throughout the construction process of the Qinling Station. Through integrated design, domestic modular customization and pre-assembly were implemented to save energy, water and materials.
In addition, the station reduced the number of temporary facilities and construction personnel on site to minimize the scope of construction activities, aligning with the goal of building an environmentally sustainable research station.
Over the past 40 years, China has become an important participant in the international governance of Antarctica.
In 1983, China acceded to the Antarctic Treaty. In October 1985, China became a consultative party to the Antarctic Treaty, obtaining decision-making status in international polar affairs.
In 2017, China successfully hosted the 40th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting and the 20th Meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection, where it led the proposal of an international initiative on green expeditions, which was widely recognized by the international community.
In 2023, China and several other countries jointly submitted a proposal to promote international cooperation on aerial surveys of the Antarctic ice cap and improve the accuracy of global sea level rise projections.
Since 2012, China has submitted over 80 proposals individually or jointly to relevant polar international organizations, comprehensively participating in the formulation of rules and regulations related to polar environmental protection and resource conservation.

New study suggests birds began their evolution long before demise of dinosaurs,2024-02-20,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0220/c90000-20134994.html,"Home>>
		
New study suggests birds began their evolution long before demise of dinosaurs
 (Xinhua) 10:04, February 20, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- A new study provides evidence suggesting that the evolution of modern birds commenced much earlier than previously believed, predating the extinction of dinosaurs.
Published earlier this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study was led by scientists from China and the United States who analyzed the genomes of 124 living bird species and created an evolutionary tree for Neoaves, which include 95 percent of all modern birds.
Combining fossil records, they found that the main lineages of birds can be divided into two groups, with one group representing land-based species and the other group representing waterbirds. They estimated that this split took place during the Late Cretaceous period (roughly 87 million years ago), long before the end-Cretaceous extinction event that wiped out dinosaurs approximately 66 million years ago.
The findings challenge the widely-held belief that the dinosaurian extinction was followed by a rapid evolution of bird species. Previous studies indicated that the catastrophe resulted in the elimination of birds' competition for resources, thereby facilitating their fast diversification into the 11,000 species we see today.
The extinction event ""seems to have had a limited impact on birds' evolution,"" said first author Wu Shaoyuan, a professor from the Jiangsu Normal University in east China.
Researchers who worked on the study also found that a global warming event occurring 55 million years ago was responsible for the evolution of modern seabird species, such as penguins and seagulls.
The new findings provide a more comprehensive and refined perspective on the evolution of birds, said co-author Zhou Zhonghe, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
""The development of modern birds, unlike the previously acknowledged pattern of rapid evolutionary changes, is a gradual and continuous process driven by natural selection. They tend to align with the diversification of plants, mammals, fish and insects,"" Zhou noted.

During the first three days of the Spring Festival holidays, the three taikonauts arranged their own activities, including video calls with family and colleagues, and engaged in recreational activities freely. Subsequently, the training and work of the three taikonauts proceeded in an orderly manner, Global Times learned from mission insiders.
According to the latest episode of the Tiangong Television series released by the China Manned Space Agency on Sunday, on the New Year's Eve, Shenzhou-17 mission commander Tang Hongbo, and his fellow crewmembers Tang Shengjie, and Jiang Xinlin put on the festive ""auspicious cloud attire,"" hung up lucky couplets, and pasted New Year paintings.
They adorned the China Space Station's Tianhe core module, Wentian and Mengtian experimental modules with Spring Festival couplets, fully embracing the New Year atmosphere while also sending Lunar New Year blessings to the ground support team.
Even in space, the crew didn't miss out on the New Year's Eve dinner. Besides traditional festive food such as dumplings and Eight Treasures Rice, the crew had also enjoyed a total of 10 dishes of unique Chinese cuisine, representing the blessing message of perfect 10. These were all carefully prepared by ground researchers as a special Chinese New Year gift for the three taikonauts.
The crew also watched and even performed singing at the Spring Festival Gala live in orbit, according to the Tiangong Television episode and the vlog highlighted a remarkable moment where the crew members interacted with the giant panda via the screen.
China's Shenzhou-17 crew members also extended their Spring Festival greetings via video from space on February 9, Chinese New Year's Eve. Onboard the country's space station, the three taikonauts expressed their wishes for the prosperity of the motherland and all Chinese people.
""We have a full and happy Chinese Lunar New Year in space,"" said Tang Hongbo.
Tang Shengjie, a first timer to space, said he missed the motherland and the family. ""It is a precious life experience for me to spend the Lunar New Year in space for the first time.""
Jiang wished the country ""vigorous and prosperous,"" and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups ""good luck and good health.""
Except for the Chinese New Year celebration, the new episode also revealed that the crew underwent a routine body check-up and carried out physical exercises in space.
The crew is the third batch of taikonauts that have celebrated the Chinese New Year in orbit, following the Shenzhou-13 and -15 crews.
Chinese netizens have left proud messages online, lauding the record that us Chinese people have celebrated the Chinese New Year for three consecutive years in space. Some noted that ""it is surely a display of Chinese strength.""
Chinese space watchers applauded the feat, saying that it was a confidence show of China's manned space capabilities such as the space-ground communication technology and the space cargo transport technology, which sustained the life quality of the taikonauts to be as comfortable as us on Earth.
The Shenzhou-17 spacecraft celebrates the Spring Festival in orbit, creating a festive atmosphere. This marks the third consecutive year that our Shenzhou taikonauts have celebrated the Lunar New Year in space, showcasing the confidence of China's aerospace capabilities. For every Chinese person on Earth, this serves as both encouragement and inspiration, observers noted.

New plant species discovered in SW China
 (Xinhua) 09:03, February 20, 2024
KUNMING, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have found a new plant species of the Rubiaceae family in southwest China's Yunnan Province, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
The findings, made by researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) of the CAS, were recently published in the journal Phytotaxa.
During a botanical expedition to a local nature reserve in Yunnan Province, the researchers collected a previously unknown Rubiaceae species. After extensive examination and comparison with other known species, the researchers confirmed that it was a new species.
The new species has been named Leptomischus bracteosus due to its distinct bracts.
""As only two populations have been found, and the population is declining due to forest fragmentation and habitat degradation, we consider the conservation status of the new species to be 'vulnerable' according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature standard,"" said Tan Yunhong, a researcher of the XTBG.
Leptomischus is a genus of plants in the family Rubiaceae, which is abundant in the tropics and includes many economically important members used for purposes such as medicine, horticulture, and food production.

LJUBLJANA, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- China has set an ""example"" in the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), an informatics professor at Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul has said.
China is making huge investments in education to enhance the development of AI products and services and has also made principles on ""how to do good research and implement good services and products,"" Edson Prestes said in an interview on the sidelines of the UNESCO Global Forum on the Ethics of AI that took place earlier this month.
During the UNESCO forum held in Slovenia, China's Vice Minister of Education Wang Jiayi said that China is willing to participate in global efforts to promote the ethics and governance of AI so that it will benefit all mankind.
Citing the China-proposed Global AI Governance Initiative and the Beijing AI Principles, which aim to support AI's healthy development, Prestes said he was a ""bit surprised"" by China's emphasis on the environment, which is included in Chinese AI governance stating the importance of citizens protecting the environment. ""That's a very good point in terms of regulation.""
The lead expert in RAM exercise said regulation should respect cultural differences between states. ""We should not have almost homogenous kind of regulation because we are different by nature and in terms of race, gender, age, and future.""
Regulation should not be solely influenced by the Global North and the West, but should emphasize global discussion on AI, he said.
""I believe China could contribute a lot to showing others how to implement AI systems and services ... and be part of international cooperation on this matter,"" he said.
""What happens in Brazil could affect the Chinese, and what affects the Chinese could also affect citizens of the United States ... It is very important to foster collaboration across countries and cooperation in building a global framework where you can accommodate different cultural aspects,"" Prestes said.
The professor, who is also an avid lover of Chinese culture, said China is a very important player in the global discussion on AI development, adding that Chinese experts have contributed greatly to this kind of discussion and debate.
He also encouraged more Chinese experts to take part in international discussions and debates on AI development. ""It is necessary to be open and listen to others, and try to consolidate these different views,"" he said.

China to become global powerhouse in tech, pharma: IMD
 (Xinhua) 10:10, February 18, 2024
GENEVA, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- China is becoming a global powerhouse in tech and pharmaceuticals, according to a new indicator released by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD).
The IMD launched its inaugural China Company Transformation Indicator (CCTI) earlier this month, focusing on technology, pharmaceuticals and apparel.
It found that internet technology firms still dominate China's technological sector, with Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent among the top five, alongside JD.com and NetEase.
IMD China's CEO Mark Greeven said in a video interview with Xinhua that three hard tech companies have also secured their place among the top 10, including semiconductor giant SMIC, computer maker Lenovo and global security technology leader Hikvision.
Meanwhile, China's hidden technology champions are likely to become global contenders in the future, said Greeven, who directed the CCTI research.
The IMD indicator also highlighted a dynamic interplay between foreign multinational corporations and innovative national companies in the pharmaceutical sector, currently led by big-name companies like Pfizer, Roche, AstraZeneca, and the emerging Chinese company Hengrui Pharmaceuticals.
Likewise, automotive businesses like BYD and new energy and battery company CATL are globalizing, he said.
""Innovation is the name of the game. All the top performers have been or are investing in innovation for the future,"" he said.
According to the authors, the indicator is designed to provide an objective, data-driven assessment of how well companies are faring in the Chinese market, and their readiness to transform and thrive in the long-term.
An indicator focusing on the automotive, new materials and food and beverage sectors is set to be published later this year.
Greeven said the Year of the Dragon will be a ""roaring year"" for the Chinese economy, given the growth of 4 or 5 percent in real estate and exports, which are traditional drivers of China's economic growth.
IMD is an independent academic institute based in Lausanne, Switzerland, and also in Singapore. It also opened a hub in Shenzhen in January last year.

SHANGHAI, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Rural farming has long been closely associated with cattle, plows and toil. Today, there are also agricultural robots and all sorts of other intelligent equipment, marking a significant shift in agricultural practices.
At the Diantian Farm in rural Shanghai, this transformation is noticeable. Here, robots operated by engineers have replaced conventional farming cattle.
Among the engineers is Li Wei, who was spotted guiding his agricultural robot with precision, clutching a controller. He is just one of over 70 engineers working at the Diantian rural cooperative, where rice is the main crop.
Over the past seven years, they have been engaged in research and development, resulting in the creation of over 60 types of agricultural robots capable of performing tasks ranging from planting to harvesting.
The robots use crawler feet that can adeptly navigate various types of terrain, while their artificial intelligence (AI) operating system serves as the brain to plan their movements.
Farmers simply need to log on to the system through the WeChat mini program on their mobile phones and switch on the robots.
""I grew up in the countryside, and I know farm work can be extremely exhausting,"" said Wang Jinyue, head of the Diantian agricultural cooperative.
In contrast to the past, today a long line of agricultural robots are dotting the field to assist with farm work.
They operate efficiently, accurately and tirelessly, said Wang, noting that technologies such as 5G, image recognition and big data enable the robots to swiftly calculate the distance to the crops and achieve rapid harvesting within seconds.
The weeding robots can not only accurately distinguish between grass and crops, but also guide the specialized knives to remove weeds precisely, he said, adding that each weeding robot can operate for eight hours on a one-hour charge.
The agricultural robots at Diantian Farm are equipped with China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). The BDS has facilitated more than 100,000 sets of agricultural machinery automatic driving systems in China.
The modernization of agriculture is underway throughout the entire country. In Hanzhong, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, intelligent equipment has made vegetable cultivation more cost-effective and efficient.
Here, an automated vegetable farm has achieved unmanned production in the entire process of cultivating green leafy vegetables. A vegetable planting area spanning about 13 hectares requires only five farmers.
China unveiled its ""No. 1 central document"" for 2024 earlier this month, outlining the priorities for comprehensively promoting rural revitalization this year.
The document called for consolidating the support of agricultural science and technology and intensifying the research on core technologies of germplasm resources.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the contribution rate of agricultural scientific and technological progress exceeded 62 percent in 2022, with the overall mechanization rate of crop cultivation and harvest reaching 73 percent.

BEIJING, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have turned to the earth science satellite SDGSAT-1 as a tool to manage the impact of modern illumination sources on the urban environment.
The study, conducted by scientists from the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), was published recently in the International Journal of Digital Earth.
According to the study, the constant need for decarbonization has led to the replacement of artificial light at night (ALAN) with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), inducing blue light pollution and its associated adverse effects. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop a technique for rapid, accurate, and large-scale discrimination of various illumination sources.
The scientists believe that the satellite SDGSAT-1 can play this role by supplementing the existing nighttime light data with multispectral and high-resolution features.
The scientists used Beijing as an example, and found that their approach is highly effective in distinguishing the various types of light sources, boasting an overall accuracy of 92 percent for ALAN and 95 percent for streetlights.
The analysis of the SDGSAT-1 images revealed clear and distinct illumination patterns, which showed spatial heterogeneity in ALAN along Beijing's 5th Ring Road, providing valuable information about how light pollution varies across different urban areas.
In addition, the scientists discovered statistically significant disparities across the road classes and the types of streetlights, illustrating the influence of urban planning and infrastructure on the prevalence of specific lighting technologies.
""This work emphasizes the crucial role of SDGSAT-1 in analyzing ALAN, providing valuable insights in urban lighting management,"" said the study.
Launched into space on Nov. 5, 2021, the satellite SDGSAT-1 is the world's first space science satellite dedicated to serving the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The satellite is designed to provide space observation data for the monitoring, evaluation and study of interactions between humans, nature and sustainable development, according to its developer, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Last September, SDGSAT-1 captured the world's first atlas of urban nighttime light remote-sensing data, providing support for the research on urban sustainable development. The atlas contains 10-meter resolution nighttime light data from 147 cities in 105 countries around the world.

Scientists invent new algorithm to improve aerosol monitoring on China's FY-4A satellite,2024-02-14,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0214/c90000-20133470.html,"Home>>
		
Scientists invent new algorithm to improve aerosol monitoring on China's FY-4A satellite
 (Xinhua) 10:37, February 14, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have recently introduced a new algorithm that combines deep learning and transfer learning to improve aerosol monitoring on China's FY-4A satellite.
The study, published in the journal Engineering, was conducted through a collaborative effort by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Satellite Meteorological Center, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and other institutes.
Scientists believe that accurate measurements of atmospheric aerosols are pivotal in understanding Earth's radiation balance, climate change, and air quality. Aboard China's geostationary meteorological satellite FY-4A, the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) scans China every five minutes, providing crucial data for monitoring aerosol spatiotemporal variations.
However, the inflexibility of traditional physical retrieval algorithms, coupled with the insufficient number of ground-based sunphotometer sites, poses challenges in meeting the extensive sample requirements for machine learning in aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval.0000000000
In response to these challenges, the scientists developed an innovative AOD retrieval algorithm that combines deep learning and transfer learning. The new algorithm incorporates key concepts from the dark target and deep blue algorithms to facilitate feature selection for machine learning.
According to the study, independent validation confirms that the algorithm is highly accurate in estimating AGRI aerosol levels. The results show a strong correlation with expected values, indicating the algorithm's reliability in predicting aerosol optical depth.
""Our study showcases the significant potential of merging the physical approach with deep learning in geoscientific analysis,"" said the lead author Fu Disong from the IAP.
""The proposed algorithm holds promise for application to other multi-spectral sensors aboard geostationary satellites,"" Fu added.
