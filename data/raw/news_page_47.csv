HAIKOU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The world's first land-based commercial small modular reactor (SMR) has started installation of its digital control system (DCS) in the country's southernmost island province of Hainan.
The reactor, also known as the Linglong One, is a multi-purpose, small modular pressurized water reactor self-developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation.
The DCS is called the ""nerve center"" of the operation of a nuclear power plant, and the reactor's DCS adopts two domestically-developed platforms, said Deng Xiaoliang, deputy general manager of Hainan Nuclear Power Co., Ltd.
The reactor is an achievement of independent innovation after Hualong One, a domestically designed third-generation nuclear reactor.
Compared with the bigger Hualong One, the 125 MW Linglong One reactor is designed for urban heating, urban cooling, industrial steam production, or seawater desalination.
The Linglong One was the world's first SMR approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2016. China started construction of the project in Hainan in 2021.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have explored the role of androgens in shaping sex differences at the molecular and cellular levels, according to a research article published in journal Nature on Wednesday.
This research has laid a foundation for the potential targeting of the androgen pathway in the treatment of sex-biased diseases.
Sex differences are widespread across human development, physiological processes and diseases, making it important to characterize the impact of sex differences in these areas.
A team of researchers from the Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, constructed a detailed single-cell transcriptomic map of 17 different tissues from a mouse.
Using this dataset, they analyzed sex differences in depth and investigated how androgens influence these differences through specific molecules and cell types. They also explored the implications of their findings on sex-biased diseases.
The researchers pinpointed the genes among these various tissues and cell types whose expression is sex-biased and directly influenced by androgens. These genes have been highlighted as potential targets for precision medicine through the modulation of the androgen pathway.
The researchers also detailed how androgens affect the prevalence of certain cell types across sexes in various tissues, notably within immune cell populations.
By integrating their findings with data from the UK Biobank, the researchers discovered the most common risk genes for multiple sex-biased diseases. Additionally, some of the genes showed sex differences or were androgen-responsive, according to the study.

Lijiang Alpine Botanic Garden of Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is located in the Yulong Snow Mountain. With an elevation difference of about 1 kilometer, seeds could be conserved under favorable conditions in this area.
As the director of the botanic garden, Xu Kun is specialized in plant resources and conservation biology. Recently, in the lab, Xu has observed that the seeds of Cypripedium flavum germinated three months ahead of schedule, which made him feel excited. This means that following experiments could be carried out sooner. The seed germination conditions of endangered Cypripedium are usually strict, and there are few new seedlings each year. After years of research, Xu and his team have obtained the aseptic germination technique of seeds of 4 Cypripedium species, which contributed to the following production procedures.
Fan Zhongyu is a technician at Lijiang Alpine Botanical Garden. Currently, Fan and his team monitor the growth of plants in Yunshanping on a sample area of 25 hectares at the east side of Yulong Snow Mountain. Every day, Fan gets up early, returns late for working in the mountain.
According to introduction, Lijiang Alpine Botanical Garden has more than 1000 native species. By far, more than 2000 alpine and subalpine species were introduced to the park.
At present, seed bank, artificial climate chamber, high-standard greenhouse, tissue culture facilities have been established at the botanic park, creating a complete research system with functions of investigation, collection, conservation, research, development, production, etc.

""Since 2018, we have been gradually exploring the application of AI technology in our classrooms,"" said Cai Lei, principal of Beijing Hongzhi Middle School. Currently, students are benefiting from the fruits of AI applications in many subjects, Cai added.
In English classes, students can use AI products to enhance their speaking skills. Whenever a word is mispronounced, it will be immediately displayed on a screen.
After Chinese language classes, teachers will utilize a large language model developed by the Research Center for Language Intelligence of China to grade students' compositions, improving their writing skills in an efficient manner.
During physical education classes, AI equipment can automatically record data on each student' performance, such as the number of pull-ups and standing long jump distances. The data is then carefully analyzed to offer tailored guidance to enhance their physical capabilities.
Beijing Hongzhi Middle School has also introduced general education curriculums on information technology and established a dedicated club to support students with a keen interest in this subject and help them develop their skills. During the winter break this year, the school launched an AI course specifically for middle school students.
""I believe the development of AI technology should allow intelligent machines to assist human life, and even expand human intelligence. I'm sure that this technology has a bright development prospect,"" said Li Muqi, a sophomore student who joined the course.
""The acquisition of knowledge about AI technology is essential for the growth of primary and secondary school students in multiple areas,"" Cai noted.
Offering AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools not only prepares students for the changing world, but also develops their cognitive processes and bolsters their scientific proficiency, laying a foundation for them to better face competition and challenges in the era of intelligence, he said.
AI is not only changing the way students learn, but also transforming teaching methods.

Wei Yungang, director of the experimental education center at Beijing Normal University's School of Artificial Intelligence, told People's Daily that currently, the main role of AI technology in education is to help with lesson planning and teaching organization.
""For instance, with help of computer vision and other AI technologies, teachers can gain better insights into students' learning status, knowledge comprehension and emotional state. This provides new ways for teachers to accurately assess the situation of each student and develop personalized teaching plans to meet their needs,"" Wei said.
Additionally, AI offers more possibilities for instructional design and teaching implementation.
""AI technology can make up for limitations of traditional classrooms and assist teachers in creating more novel and engaging curriculum. For instance, big data analysis can help identify the most effective teaching methods and materials; generative AI can be used for knowledge search and classroom scenario simulations; augmented reality technology can make classroom presentations more engaging and effective,"" Wei explained.
Today, Chinese universities are strengthening the development of AI disciplines. As of 2023, 498 universities in the country had offered undergraduate programs in AI.
Many Chinese universities are collaborating with major tech companies to provide joint training programs for AI talents, so as to adapt to the rapid iteration of AI technology, the high demand for AI professionals, and the extensive applications of AI.
Wuhan University recently announced to establish a robotics department within its School of Computer Science together with tech firm Xiaomi. Focusing on core AI technologies, the robotics department aims to build a collaborative innovation system integrating enterprises, universities, research institutions, and end-users.
Huazhong University of Science and Technology has partnered with tech giant Baidu to establish an innovation center for AI education, which will combine teaching scenarios with industrial needs to conduct cutting-edge education and scientific research, thereby supplying the industry with innovative talents in large model applications and development.
""AI is a discipline involving computer science, mathematics, statistics, cognitive science, and other related areas. When cultivating AI talents at institutions of higher education, we should place a strong emphasis on building a solid foundation of knowledge while also strengthening school-enterprise cooperation and the collaboration among enterprises, universities, and research institutions, thus allowing students to grow through practical experience,"" said Wei.

CHANGSHA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A central Chinese hospital has performed a rare surgery in which a kidney was excised, the tumor and aneurysm removed before the organ was implanted back to the patient's body.
The surgery was conducted in late March at the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in central China's Hunan Province in an innovative method that had not been documented before.
The patient is a 24-year-old woman who had wished to keep her right kidney despite having both a renal tumor and renal artery aneurysm, for which the conventional treatment is complete removal of the kidney.
The hospital summoned a multidisciplinary medical team led by Chen Minfeng to design the operation, which has seen the kidney excised, flushed with cold preservation solution and placed on the operating table for medics to swiftly remove the tumor and the aneurysm, and reconstruct renal blood vessels. Transplant doctors then implanted the kidney back into the patient's body.
Chen said the two lesions were too close to each other, leaving little space for the surgery to be safely conducted inside the abdomen, so to keep the kidney, the tumor removal should be performed outside the body.
The entire medical procedure took five hours, including 56 minutes of cold ischemia.
The patient has recently been discharged from hospital after recovery, according to the hospital.

Interview: World-renowned mathematician acclaims China's mathematics research
 (Xinhua) 15:36, April 10, 2024
TIANJIN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese mathematics researchers are enthusiastic, hardworking and dedicated, which makes people very hopeful for the development of the Chinese community in mathematics, said Artur Avila, a world-renowned mathematician, in an interview with Xinhua during his recent visit to Tianjin Municipality, north China.
French-Brazilian mathematician Avila was officially appointed as a guest professor at Nankai University in early April, starting a new journey of his mathematical communication and cooperation.
Avila, who works as a professor at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, is known for his profound contributions to the field of dynamical systems and spectral theory.
In 2014, he was awarded the Fields Medal, one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive.
Avila's academic experience in mathematics is full of cross-cultural exchange and integration. After completing all his studies in Brazil, he chose to move to France to be exposed to different people and different mathematics.
""I think that one thing that's very important is to change your environment from time to time. You need to get outside of your initial field to see a little bit more of the diversity of math,"" Avila said.
He added that mathematics is very international. Seeing different groups of mathematicians and different culturally influenced mathematics can be very important for the development of any mathematician.
Avila also believes that China's mathematics discipline has performed well in the quality of education.
""I feel that in a sense China is being seen as a more important part of mathematics in the world. It's becoming more and more unavoidable to interact here,"" Avila said.
Actually, Avila had a deep cooperation with two of Nankai University's professors. The pair came up with a surprising idea that provided a new way of attacking a well-known problem.
""Seeing such a new idea was unexpected to me, which was really nice and gave me more enthusiasm to keep collaborating with them,"" Avila said, adding that he was very happy to come to Nankai University to visit their workplace.
Avila also delivered a lecture in Nankai University. While sharing his ideas, he was impressed by the enthusiasm and curiosity of young Chinese students for mathematics.
""From the young students, I felt enthusiasm. They really want to understand how is actually the process that still ahead of them. They think hard about how the future will go. I try to answer and be helpful to the best of my abilities. I hope it will help them,"" Avila said.
He said that China has been making good progress in the field of mathematics, and he has five Chinese PhD students, whose diversified research styles show the vitality and potential of China's mathematical community, which is exactly what mathematics needs.
""Mathematics is international. There's not one style of doing mathematics. Different cultures can be developed within China,"" Avila said, adding that he expects that more and more countries can strengthen mathematical cultural exchanges to spur innovation.

Chang'e 6 to carry foreign science payloads,2024-04-10,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0410/c90000-20155361.html,"Home>>
		
Chang'e 6 to carry foreign science payloads
By Zhao Lei (China Daily) 14:57, April 10, 2024
China's upcoming lunar mission has garnered global attention for more reasons than one. The Chang'e 6 robotic probe will not only make an ambitious and unprecedented attempt to collect samples from the lunar far side, it will also carry three European science payloads to the site.
The mission holds great significance because the new samples will enable scientists to study and better understand the history and the physics of the moon.
According to the China National Space Administration, the three foreign science payloads include a radon measuring instrument from France's national space agency that will help study the movement of lunar dust and some volatile chemicals between the lunar regolith, a layer of unconsolidated rocky material, and the lunar exosphere.
The second foreign science payload is a passive laser retroreflector from Italy's National Institute for Nuclear Physics that will be used as a laser range-finder for the Chang'e 6 lander.
The third payload, developed by the Swedish Institute of Space Physics with support from the European Space Agency, will be the first-ever dedicated negative ion instrument flown beyond Earth. It will seek to detect negative ions emitted from the lunar surface as a result of interaction with solar wind.
More than 20 proposals from foreign space agencies and research organizations contested for the golden opportunity to join the Chang'e 6 mission and touch down on the moon's little-known far side, which has so far been the subject of scientific speculation and wild imagination. The three from France, Italy and Sweden emerged as winners.
Yang Yuguang, a senior space industry observer and vice-chair of the International Astronautical Federation's Space Transportation Committee, said that opening a nation's spacecraft to other nations' science payloads has become a common practice among space powers because international cooperation can maximize a mission's scientific value.
""An opportunity to put your science devices on a spacecraft, especially a historic one like the Chang'e 6, is always enthusiastically sought by scientists around the world,"" he said.
China and Europe have engaged in space industry cooperation for many years, and such collaborative projects have brought benefits to both sides, Yang said, citing the successful cooperation in data relay during China's Tianwen 1 Mars mission.
Wang Yanan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the Chang'e 6 mission will offer European scientists the first chance to deploy their instruments on the lunar far side, which will be a landmark moment for the planetary research community in Europe.
""Through this move, China has shown its sincerity and capability to bolster international space cooperation, and it will also definitely advance the collaboration in lunar exploration and development between China and Europe,"" Wang said.
A Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket, carrying the Chang'e 6 robotic probe, is scheduled to blast off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center on the east coast of Hainan province in the coming weeks.
If everything goes according to plan, the spacecraft will make a series of flight maneuvers and finally land in the South Pole-Aitken Basin.
Like Chang'e 5, its predecessor, the Chang'e 6 spacecraft is a product of the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing and also consists of four components â an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module.
After collecting dust and rocks on the moon, the ascender will transport the samples to the lunar orbit for transfer into the reentry module, which will carry them to Earth.
Meanwhile, scientific instruments on the lander will continue to perform their operations as long as they have sufficient power.
The United States, the former Soviet Union and China have brought lunar samples to Earth, but none has ever obtained soil from the far side of the moon.
Although the far side had been previously photographed by spacecraft, no probe had ever touched down on it until China's Chang'e 4 mission, which landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin in January 2019.

Researchers unveil variations of pregnancy microbiome, links to reproductive disorders
 (Xinhua) 14:24, April 10, 2024
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Researchers recently unveiled the evolving patterns of pregnancy microbiome, aiming to analyze the impact of the microbial ecosystem on the health of both mothers and their offspring.
The study, jointly conducted by a team consisting of researchers from the Beijing Institutes of Life Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, has been published in the journal Science Bulletin.
During pregnancy, the female microbiome undergoes significant changes, which may lead to reproductive disorders. Nevertheless, there is a lack of large-scale integrated investigations that characterize microbiome dynamics across key body habitats.
In this regard, researchers performed an extensive meta-analysis that compiles and analyzes microbiome profiles from over 10,000 samples across the gut, vagina, and oral cavity of pregnant women from diverse geographical regions.
They unveiled unexpected variations in the taxonomic, functional, and ecological characteristics of microbial communities throughout the course of pregnancy, and established a comprehensive atlas of the pregnancy microbiome by integrating multidimensional datasets.
Researchers found that as pregnancy advances, the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota undergo significant changes, adapting to fluctuations in hormone levels during pregnancy, which may affect maternal metabolism and immune system.
The study also discovered a correlation between an increased abundance of bacteria from the genus Bacteroides and a higher occurrence of gestational diabetes, suggesting that the bacteria could serve as a crucial biomarker for monitoring maternal health.
During pregnancy, the diversity of vagina microbiota decreases, while the abundance of Lactobacillus significantly increases. Potential disruption of the microbial ecosystem dominated by Lactobacillus may affect pregnancy outcomes.
The study also revealed that the vagina microbiota network of women who deliver preterm exhibits greater disturbances compared to healthy pregnant women. There is a significant decrease in Lactobacillus abundance in the preterm group. This phenomenon is observable in early pregnancy and predictable by machine learning models.
By comparing the oral microbiota of healthy pregnant women from different regions, researchers found that the oral microbial variations are relatively stable during pregnancy. Significant differences, however, were observed in the microbial composition and diversity of pregnant women with gestational diabetes, with an obvious decrease in Streptococcus and an increase in Corynebacterium.
These changes could serve as a basis for the early diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Additionally, it suggests that oral microbiota might be used as a relatively stable and easily detectable indicator for monitoring maternal health during pregnancy.
The intricate ecosystem of pregnancy microbiome holds profound implications for the health of both mothers and fetuses. In-depth research in this field is poised to offer novel insights into future clinical practices and medical technologies.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- As China works to send more taikonauts on long-term missions in space, ensuring their well-being has become a matter of public concern. The cutting-edge devices aboard the Tiangong Space Station have proved to be invaluable tools in maintaining the safety and health of the these taikonauts in a zero-gravity environment.
The China Manned Space Agency has recently unveiled fascinating footage of a taikonaut crew engaging in rigorous workouts in space to mitigate the physiological impacts of prolonged exposure to microgravity.
The agency said that taikonauts in orbit need one to two hours of exercise daily to counteract the effects of microgravity, which include muscle loss, abnormal heart rates and immune system disorders. The three-module space station has fitness areas stocked with various equipment, including rowing machines, treadmills and resistance devices, so that taikonauts can stay fit.

The crew members in orbit were also seen wearing specially designed uniforms equipped with elastic resistance bands that enable them to experience elastic force, inducing muscle tension and counteracting the detrimental effects of a weightless environment on muscle.
During spaceflight, medical staff on the ground can continuously monitor the body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and other physiological indicators of any taikonaut in orbit in real-time, and they maintain regular communication.
During the Shenzhou-11 mission in 2016, China tested its first space-Earth telemedical consultation system. The orbiting taikonauts transmitted their physiological data from the spaceship, allowing doctors on Earth to provide diagnoses and prescriptions, which were subsequently returned to the crew in space.
The Chinese ""space home"" also features an onboard clinic for its residents, providing various devices that monitor vital signs regularly. Additionally, the clinic is able to track organ functions and offer emergency first aid and trauma medical supplies, according to the space agency.
Available devices include cardiopulmonary resuscitators and ultrasound machines, and they are designed to be more compact than normal to save space aboard the orbiting station.

The real-time data of taikonauts is accessible thanks to wearable monitoring equipment. Even if a spacecraft enters the blackout zone -- a zone that a spacecraft passes through when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds, where communication with the ground is interrupted -- the equipment on taikonauts' suits can store their data for future analysis by ground personnel.
The Tiangong Space Station also offers a unique service in space that is not available to their peers aboard the International Space Station: traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment. In their latest video update, the Shenzhou-17 taikonauts can be seen using a TCM diagnostic instrument to test their health. And in 2022, the Shenzhou-13 crew was spotted receiving acupuncture in zero gravity, garnering millions of views on social media.

Russia confirmed on Monday that TÃ¼rkiye has applied to participate in the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) jointly initiated by China and Russia, making it the 10th nation to join the group following Thailand. The news coincided with the arrival in Beijing of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for a visit to China. Russia has also invited other BRICS members to join the lunar research.
Anatoly Petrukovich, director of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS IKI), made the announcement, citing TÃ¼rkiye's emerging role in global space endeavors, according to Russian and Turkish media reports.
This initiative ""represents a new chapter in TÃ¼rkiye's quest for a robust presence in space research and exploration,"" the TÃ¼rkiye Newspaper said on Monday. By applying to the ILRS, TÃ¼rkiye seeks to boost its scientific and technological prowess, the report noted, adding that the country will also be joining an elite group of nations dedicated to advancing space exploration.
Russia has also invited other BRICS member countries to discuss cooperation on the Moon research, Lev Zeleny, scientific director of the RAS IKI, said on Monday, according to TV BRICS, a Moscow-based media outlet dedicated to covering news among BRICS members.
""We are thinking of organizing a big cooperation on lunar exploration within the BRICS. So far these are only plans. Perhaps we will discuss them in the near future at a meeting of BRICS countries,"" Zeleny said at a press conference ahead of Cosmonautics Day, which falls on April 12.
Petrukovich said that future plans for the ILRS include establishing a collaborative data processing center to consolidate essential information for lunar exploration. Additionally, China and Russia have signed a cooperation pact between their respective lunar projects, Chang'e-7 and Luna-26, facilitating joint operations in orbit.
The possibility of putting a nuclear reactor on the Moon is also being considered, Petrukovich said.
China plans to work with global partners to construct a basic version of the ILRS before 2028, an improved version before 2040, and a more complete one with application functions by around 2050, Director General of China's Deep Space Exploration Laboratory Wu Weiren previously revealed.
The basic version of the ILRS to be completed before 2028 will execute lunar environment exploration and experiments as well as verification of the use of lunar resources, while the improved version will be able to conduct Earth-moon space environment exploration and relevant scientific experiments as well as the construction of comprehensive constellation Queqiao satellites, which will enhance communication, navigation and remote sensing capabilities.
Following these developments, the lunar research station will be gradually upgraded into a multi-function, application-oriented moon base, Wu noted.
""We welcome all countries to join hands in the International Lunar Research Station,"" Wu said.
As the first step toward building the ILRS, China will launch the Chang'e-6 lunar probe in the first half of 2024, which will attempt to achieve the world's first return of a lunar sample from the dark side of the moon.
The ILRS has already attracted the interest of more than a dozen countries and organizations, including Venezuela, South Africa, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Belarus, Egypt, and Thailand. Several US-based and European organizations have also cooperated with China and Russia on the program, including the Hawaii-based International Lunar Observatory Association, Swiss company Nano-SPACE for Cooperation, and France's Thales Group.

Chinese satellite deploys pioneering 3D-printed storage tank
 (Xinhua) 10:03, April 10, 2024
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The cold propulsion system on Tiandu-2, a communication and navigation technology test satellite, is working well, marking the first in-orbit application of a 3D-printed storage tank in China, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
The cold propulsion system recently provided high-precision orbital attitude control for the satellite during lunar orbit, marking the first successful application of the liquid ammonia cold air micro-propulsion system in the field of deep-space exploration.
The storage tank is an important component of satellite propulsion systems. As a pressure component, it requires not only high precision of forming and no leakage, but also good anti-fatigue performance, allowing for repeated fuel filling and discharge.
The development team from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation has mastered a number of key technologies to connect the components inside the storage box through 3D printing, which has greatly shortened the development cycle and effectively reduced the cost.
On March 20, China launched the new relay satellite Queqiao-2 and two communication and navigation technology test satellites Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2.

Smart farming blooms on Chengdu plain

On a morning in Chongzhou, Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan province, Wang Lingli opened an app on her phone. Seeing that the temperature was 14 degrees Celsius with no rain expected for the next two hours, she grabbed her drone and headed out the door.
As a professional agricultural manager, Wang leads a team of 13 who utilize smart farming software to manage 7,000 mu (around 467 hectares) of farmland of four cooperatives.
""Our top priority right now is to apply pesticide to prevent pests and diseases,"" said Wang, as she skillfully piloted the drone to release an even mist of pesticide over the fields.
The fickle spring weather on the Chengdu plain makes precision farming crucial. ""If a sudden rain comes before the pesticides are absorbed, they get washed away, which is a waste of resources and harms the soil,"" Wang explained.
The app Wang uses can provide accurate weather forecast for the next two hours, thus she can arrange her work accordingly.

Taking a break, Wang shared the benefits of agricultural informatization with People's Daily: ""My phone manages every aspect of farming.""
Through remote sensing technology, Wang can view soil moisture levels and crop growth conditions right on her phone, giving her a ""diagnostic report"" to guide field management. Besides, agricultural experts provide her with online consultations and on-site support, serving as an ever-present ""brain trust"". The app also connects directly to supply and sales platforms, maximizing income while reducing costs.
Without pausing, Wang hurried to a smart seedling center. ""Rice seedling cultivation begins in early April. In May, it's the wheat harvest. Then we prepare the fields, fertilize, and transplant the seedlings - the schedule is fully packed,"" Wang said.
The center, which is operated by the cooperative that Wang works for, has six zones including a seeding production line, nutrient soil storage, and a sprouting room. Some of the seedling equipment were already being tested and calibrated.
""My phone is connected to the center's control system, so that I can check real-time seedling data,"" said Wang. Compared to traditional manual methods, the smart system significantly improves the survival rate and quality of seedling, she added.

As cultivation scales up and technologies advance, Wang is also integrating modern corporate management practices into the cooperative to boost incomes for member farmers. Last year, the fields managed by her team yielded a total of 6,000 tons of wheat and rice - nearly 25 kilograms higher per mu than non-member farmers.
Wang's career was inspired by her father, Wang Zhiquan, one of Chengdu's first professional agricultural managers. It was under her father's encouragement that she returned home and joined the cooperative after graduating from university in 2015.
Initially, having grown accustomed to traditional farming methods, Wang Zhiquan was reluctant to leave his ""comfort zone."" When Wang Lingli proposed buying a rice transplanter to replace manual labor, he objected. So, the two divided a field to test the approaches. Ultimately, the machine's efficiency proved superior, boosting Wang Zhiquan's confidence in modern agricultural technologies.
These days, Wang Zhiquan often ""peeks"" at his daughter's phone, which displays the rice transplanter's BeiDou navigation paths and planting densities in vivid detail. Recalling his stubborn resistance years ago, he admitted, ""You have to trust the vision of the younger generation.""
As new seedlings sprout, technologies are ""sown."" Today, 90 percent of agricultural production in Chongzhou has been informationized.
