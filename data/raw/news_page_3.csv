Professor Hai Jiangbo talks with Ngnadong Wansim Aboubakar, a doctoral candidate from Cameroon, at the College of Agronomy, Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University in Yangling, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, Sept. 3, 2024. (Xinhua/Shao Rui)
XI'AN, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- Following his 27th journey to the African continent in January, Hai Jiangbo, a 58-year-old agriculture professor, envisions his life after retirement a few years from now: he hopes to return to Africa to establish an agricultural base.
During his January visit, Hai, a faculty member at the College of Agronomy, Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, dedicated 20 days to Guinea. There, he helped to craft comprehensive agricultural development plans, advocating for the country to establish a distinct agricultural identity through robust branding and strategic agricultural production planning.
Hai's connection with Africa was forged in 2003 when he joined the third batch of Chinese educators dispatched to Ethiopia as part of a teaching initiative.
Initially tasked with teaching phytophysiology and agroecology, he encountered a diverse classroom of students aged 12 to 45. Despite the scarcity of internet and his nascent English proficiency, he diligently translated Chinese textbooks into English. This year-long endeavor marked the genesis of his profound bond with Africa.
Over the past two decades, Hai's fervor for African agriculture has remained unflagging. He has been involved in multiple aid projects from Ethiopia to Tanzania, Kenya to Madagascar. With each venture, he has transplanted China's successful agricultural varieties, technologies and management paradigms to Africa.
In Cameroon, Hai was instrumental in boosting the yield of local rice to an impressive 7 tonnes per hectare across nearly two hectares of demonstration fields by integrating some rice cultivation techniques.
In Benin, his team successfully adapted two Chinese maize varieties to better withstand the erosive effects of seawater and rainfall, enhancing the local saline-alkali soils and ensuring stable agricultural yields.
Beyond enhancing agricultural development, Hai has also ignited a passion for agricultural education among African students. Over the span of 21 years, he has visited 13 African countries, mentoring and training over 10,000 African students at the master's and doctoral levels, agricultural technicians, and government officials through a blend of online and in-person sessions.
Some of these foreign students have even opted to pursue their studies in China. So far, Hai has mentored 12 African students at the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral levels at Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University.
One such student is Ngnadong Wansim Aboubakar from Cameroon, who is currently pursuing his PhD under Hai's guidance. ""Professor Hai encouraged me to see him as family, not just as a tutor or supervisor. He also inspired me to return to China for my PhD. All that I have achieved is due to his mentorship and support,"" Aboubakar said.
For Hai, Africa is a paradise for agricultural development, blessed with abundant natural resources, favorable light and heat conditions, ample rainfall, extensive river networks as well as vast tracts of land. However, its agricultural productivity remains low due to technological and talent constraints, leading to food shortages and subsequent social issues.
Hai sees immense potential for agricultural growth in Africa, where his knowledge and technologies can be most effectively utilized. ""China's agricultural experiences have provided us with a wealth of experience in agricultural production and rural development. I believe these experiences can be highly beneficial to Africa,"" he said.
After retirement, Hai plans to return to Africa and establish experimental stations, farms or cooperatives with his African students. He aspires to implement more Chinese agricultural experiences in Africa, aiding in the continent's agricultural development and providing a stable foundation for China's agricultural research on the continent.
""Together with my students, I wish to contribute to the agricultural development of African countries, to their food security and to improving the malnutrition situation. I am confident that the future of the China-Africa community with a shared future is very bright,"" he noted.

Chinese, foreign experts call for agricultural sci-tech innovation to combat climate change
 (Xinhua) 16:23, October 11, 2024
BEIJING, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- About 800 experts from China and around the world convened Friday at the 2024 World Agrifood Innovation Conference (WAFI 2024), advocating a low-carbon transition in agrifood systems through sci-tech innovation to address climate change.
The conference, themed ""Climate Change and Agrifood Systems Transformation,"" highlights the urgent need for innovation in the agricultural sector.
Sun Qixin, president of the China Agricultural University (CAU), emphasized that agricultural production activities are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with nearly one-third of total emissions coming from the agrifood system.
""We need to achieve a low-carbon transition in agrifood systems to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture,"" Sun said. ""Sci-tech innovation plays a central role in this process.""
Meanwhile, as global temperatures reach record highs, climate change is increasingly impacting agrifood systems. Sun noted that innovation is essential for building resilience in these systems, enabling the development of new crop varieties that can withstand climate challenges.
Zhang Xingwang, vice minister of agriculture and rural affairs, also emphasized in his opening speech the role of agricultural sci-tech innovation to ensure global food security and foster sustainable agricultural development.
Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), stressed the importance of transforming agrifood systems to combat climate change effectively. She expressed hope that sci-tech advancements would enhance both resilience and ecological sustainability.
Experts at the conference acknowledged the numerous challenges facing agrifood system transformation and the need for global collaboration to share experiences and results through ongoing dialogue.
Fan Shenggen, dean of the Academy of Global Food Economics and Policy at CAU, pointed out that accelerating global warming poses severe challenges to agrifood systems.

Human scientific research may have reached a pivotal moment where scientific research landscape may adopt a new paradigm — the AI-driven research paradigm, Chinese scientists said on Thursday after the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry were announced.
The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry were awarded to scientists who made significant breakthroughs at the intersection of AI and fundamental sciences, which came as somewhat of a surprise to many. Some viewed the award as a bellwether indicating that the scientific community officially recognizes AI's decisive impact on science, while others expressed concern that AI is taking away the most prestigious honors from scientists.
The fact that this year's Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to machine learning scientists, while the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was still awarded to three scientists in the field of computational research, reflects the significant scientific value of AI, Xu Chunfu, a researcher at the Beijing Institute of Life Sciences, told the Global Times.
""The human scientific research may have reached a pivotal moment after this year's Nobel Prize where the entire scientific research landscape may adopt a new paradigm, the AI-driven research paradigm,"" Xiao Yanghua, a computer science professor at Fudan University, also director of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, told the Global Times.
In the future, scientists from traditional natural sciences may utilize AI tools to enhance their research, while also seeking inspiration from natural sciences to explore and solve problems within AI. These research approaches will likely become widely adopted across basic science research, Xiao said.
The potential of AI in health fields such as biology, chemistry, and medicine has only just begun to emerge, and there is still significant room for development in the future, said Xu.
While scientists embrace the changed research paradigm and immerse themselves in the joy that AI brings them, they are also aware of its limitations.
AI, as an extension of human intelligence, is still fundamentally just a tool that performs auxiliary roles under the supervision and control of scientists, Xiao noted.
Whether AI can currently propose new, groundbreaking theories like human scientists is still questionable, the expert said.
Some have commented on whether the Nobel Prize being awarded to AI means it is about to surpass humanity and if AI is taking away the most important honors from scientists. Xiao said, ""No matter how advanced AI becomes, it is still created by humans.""
From the perspective of scientific research, we need to recognize that AI can also make mistakes, Xiao noted. Xu emphasized that scientists should apply AI more responsibly and refrain from using it for scientific research that violates ethical standards or is harmful to human health.

GUANGZHOU, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- China has constructed the world's largest transparent spherical detector 700 meters underground to capture elusive neutrinos, often dubbed ""ghost particles,"" to unravel the secrets of the infinitesimally small and the infinitely vast in the universe.
The 12-story-tall acrylic sphere with a diameter of 35.4 meters, buried deep in a granite layer of a hill in Kaiping, Jiangmen City in south China's Guangdong Province, is the core part of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a gigantic and complex scientific facility.
The construction of the challenging project, launched by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Guangdong government in 2015, has entered the final stage. Installation of the entire device is expected to be completed by the end of November, and the full operation of the facility is scheduled for August 2025, according to the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the CAS, the project's leading institution.
As one of the world's most powerful experiments to uncover neutrino mystery, JUNO is expected to operate for at least 30 years. The observatory is designed to help scientists better understand the neutrino mass hierarchy by detecting reactor neutrinos from the nearby Yangjiang and Taishan nuclear power plants with an unprecedented 3 percent energy resolution, said Wang Yifang, chief scientist of JUNO and head of the IHEP.
Understanding the neutrino mass hierarchy could have huge implications for physical models of the universe and for the research on cosmic evolution, said Wang.

Feature: Chinese scientist's 31 trips in quest for Sri Lankans' safe water
 (Xinhua) 16:50, October 10, 2024
COLOMBO, Oct. 10 (Xinhua) -- In an office drawer of Chinese scientist Wei Yuansong lies a thank-you letter written in Sinhalese and signed off by an entire Sri Lankan village.
The letter, having passed through many hands and franked in various locations, tells shared memories of a decade-long fight against a killer kidney disease that had plagued the locals for years due to a lack of safe drinking water.
""We express our heartfelt gratitude to Professor Wei for providing us with safe and tasty drinking water,"" folks from the Nildiya village wrote.
Now serving as the director of the Laboratory of Water Pollution Control Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wei told Xinhua that his connection with Sri Lanka began in August 2013, when an email from Doctor S.K.Weragoda asked about water treatment collaboration to address the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) in that country.
At that time, CKDu was a major public health issue in Sri Lanka, with over 40,000 people suffering from it since the mid-1990s, statistics showed. In 2016, then Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena called the disease a ""national disaster"" that affected 20,828 patients and caused 5,000 deaths per year.
Preliminary research by the World Health Organization indicated a strong correlation between the disease and local groundwater pumped for drinking, and correspondence with Sri Lankan scientists made the issue come into the view of their Chinese counterparts.
In August 2014, Wei made his first travel to Sri Lanka, initiating an arduous research journey together with Weragoda. Each day, they took hours of bumpy road trips deep into the heavily affected areas and paid home visits to villagers for epidemic inquiries.
However, the duo encountered many cold shoulders and doubts. ""Many locals thought that the Chinese, like other (foreign researchers), were here to write papers, not to genuinely help them,"" Wei recalled. The two scientists had to wade through difficult conversations to win their trust and were eventually welcomed to take samples crucial for their analysis.
Following preliminary research and extensive coordination between Chinese and Sri Lankan partners, a deal was inked in March 2015, enabling joint research on the causes of CKDu and drinking water safety. Since then, Wei frequented Sri Lanka along with more Chinese scientists to conduct thorough research into water treatment solutions that fit local conditions.
Over the following years, the Chinese academy and its partner built four drinking water facilities in Sri Lanka, providing safe drinking water to over 5,000 villagers and more than 1,300 students, followed by a China-Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Center for Water Technology (JRDC) founded in the central city of Kandy.
The center has since trained more than 30 local medical workers, 20 kidney disease investigators, 20 water professionals, and 30 graduate students. Two joint CKDu-related research papers by Wei's team won the Sri Lankan President's Awards for Scientific Research in 2023 and 2024.
""The local people now trust Chinese scientists wholeheartedly ... villagers with kidney disease said they no longer go to the hospital for years thanks to the help of Chinese scientists,"" said Titus Cooray, a Ph.D. student at the JRDC.
This July, Wei came and attended a China-Sri Lanka joint research workshop at the JRDC themed on climate change, marine sustainability and other topics, with participants from nearly ten countries, including the United States, Canada and the Maldives.
""This is my 31st trip to Sri Lanka. We have laid the foundation from zero to one, and future collaboration will undoubtedly progress from one to infinity,"" Wei told Xinhua at the event.
""China has transitioned from being a participant to a leader in global environmental governance, and we aim to bring more benefits to the Sri Lankan people through scientific cooperation and to make this project a model of the 'Belt and Road' international cooperation,"" he noted.

 (Xinhua) 15:03, October 10, 2024
SYDNEY, Oct. 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 160,000 new virus species have been discovered by Chinese and Australian researchers using artificial intelligence (AI).
A team of scientists from the University of Sydney, Apsara Lab of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence and Sun Yat-sen University revealed in a study published in Cell that they used a new machine-learning tool to discover 161,979 new species of ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus.
The study was the largest virus species discovery paper ever published, the researchers said in a media release on Thursday.
The researchers said that the machine learning tool could significantly improve the mapping of life on the earth and aid in the identification of millions more viruses.
""This is the largest number of new virus species discovered in a single study, massively expanding our knowledge of the viruses that live among us,"" Edward Holmes, senior author of the study from the School of Medical Sciences at the University of Sydney, said in the media release.
""To find this many new viruses in one fell swoop is mind-blowing, and it just scratches the surface, opening up a world of discovery. There are millions more to be discovered, and we can apply this same approach to identifying bacteria and parasites.""
To make the discovery, the researchers built a machine learning tool, called LucaProt, capable of computing genomically complex information and vast genetic sequence data.
Holmes said that many of the viruses had already been sequenced but that LucaProt was able to organize and categorize disparate information to identify viruses.
Co-author Li Zhaorong from the Apsara Lab of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence said the study demonstrated that AI can effectively accomplish tasks in biological exploration.
The team will next train the tool to identify even more viral diversity.

BEIJING, Oct. 9 (Xinhua) -- China has initiated the lunar landing phase of its manned lunar exploration program, with a plan to complete a manned lunar landing by 2030. Among all the challenges faced by scientists and engineers working on the program, lunar dust is very small in size, but potentially a big threat to lunar exploration missions.
However, Chinese researchers have found a simple, fast and promising way to build an anti-dust shield by fabricating a lunar dust-repellent surface via nanosecond laser etching, according to a paper published in the journal ACS Applied Materials &Interfaces.
LUNAR DUST THREAT
Lunar dust consists of tiny silicate particles, which are formed from lunar rocks after long-term exposure to micrometeorite impacts, solar winds and cosmic radiation. Mostly between tens to hundreds of microns in size, these particles are almost invisible to the naked eye.
Despite their small size, such particles pose a significant risk, as high temperatures generated by meteorite impacts make them vitrified, rough, sharp and electrically charged. This means they tend to stick to lunar exploration equipment and astronaut spacesuits, thereby threatening the operation of equipment and the health of astronauts.
According to Wang Xiao, an author of the paper and a member of the research team from Xidian University, lunar dust can easily infiltrate gaps and bearings of mechanical equipment and continuously accumulate there, leading to increased friction, intensified wear and other difficulties in equipment operation.
Lunar dust can also lead to the failure of other parts of lunar equipment. They can cover the equipment surface, especially critical parts like radiators, preventing effective heat radiation and making the equipment either too cold or too hot.
In addition, lunar dust can stick to optical lenses or solar panels, causing a decline in image quality and the accuracy of data collection. They can also block the absorption of sunlight by solar panels, leading to insufficient power supply.
NANOSECOND LASER ETCHING
According to Wang Weidong, leader of the Xidian University team, there are two types of anti-lunar dust technology -- namely active and passive. Active dust protection technology relies on external energy sources. Due to limited lunar energy resources and the high cost of energy generation and storage, such active technology is seldom used.
Passive technology, in contrast, can protect equipment from lunar dust by altering the surface structure, selecting materials with self-cleaning properties, or applying a dust-resistant coating to equipment. This has become an important approach due to its high efficiency, long-term reliability and energy independence.
Wang's team opted for aluminum as their chosen material, as it is lightweight, high-strength and corrosion-resistant, and then used nanosecond laser etching to prepare multi-level and micro-structure surfaces with different structural parameters.
Nanosecond laser etching is a material processing technology that utilizes ultra-short pulse lasers with a pulse duration measured in nanoseconds. One nanosecond is one-billionth of a second.
The team achieved multi-level, micro- and nano-structures by adjusting parameters including laser energy density, pulse frequency and duration, as well as scanning speed.
ANTI-DUST IMPACT
During the process of using different parameters, the team found that the aluminum surface treated with a scanning spacing of 80 microns had the smallest contact area with dust particles, thus resulting in the best anti-dust effect.
The study also found that the adhesion force of lunar dust to the aluminum surface etched by nanosecond lasers with a scanning spacing of 80 microns, is 52 percent lower than the adhesion force of lunar dust to the untreated aluminum surface.
In the same dust-raising environment, the dust coverage on the aluminum surface etched by the laser is about 85 percent less than that on the untreated aluminum surface. In addition, the accumulated dust on the laser-etched aluminum surface is easily cleaned up by a combination of flipping and gravity.
Wang Xiao revealed that the team will conduct extensive engineering tests and assessments of this technology -- hoping that it could become one of the options used for spacecraft surface protection.
If proven effective, this technology could be applied to the surfaces of lunar rovers, thermal control equipment, mechanical structures and solar panels, in order to achieve low adhesion of lunar dust, resulting in greater convenience and safety for human exploration efforts on the moon, he added.
