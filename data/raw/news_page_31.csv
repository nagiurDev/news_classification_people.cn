Chinese scientists prove early insulin therapy effective for type 2 diabetes
 (Xinhua) 14:47, June 07, 2024
HEFEI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have demonstrated the effectiveness of early insulin therapy for newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), which can reduce the risks of stroke and hospitalization due to heart failure compared to those who have not received the treatment.
A joint research team led by Professor Weng Jianping from Anhui Medical University, and scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China, Southern Medical University, and Peking University, conducted a 24-year observational study on the treatment of 5,424 T2D patients across the country.
They found that newly diagnosed T2D patients who underwent the therapy experienced a 31 percent reduced risk of stroke and a 28 percent lower risk of hospitalization due to heart failure.
This study further demonstrates the effectiveness of early insulin therapy in improving biomarkers related to low-grade inflammation and endothelial function, which are known indicators of cardiovascular risk, in newly diagnosed T2D patients.
This provides compelling evidence for adopting early insulin therapy as a first-line treatment option for newly diagnosed patients.
The findings were published in the international journal of Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy in early June.

Scientists seek to safeguard biodiversity in SW China
 (Xinhua) 11:20, June 07, 2024
KUNMING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Engineer Fan Zhongyu is well acquainted with the status of over 47,000 trees in a primeval forest beneath the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in southwest China's Yunnan Province, as if they were extensions of his own abode.
Fan, who works at Lijiang Forest Biodiversity National Observation and Research Station, Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB), Chinese Academy of Sciences, has dedicated over a decade to collecting leaves and seeds, observing seedlings, measuring and monitoring trees in a forest sample plot at an altitude of about 3,200 meters.
""We hope that through decades of long-term monitoring and observing the laws of forest and biodiversity development, we can accumulate observation data for future generations,"" Fan said.
Lijiang station is situated in the transitional zone from the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in northwestern Yunnan, which stands as one of the global biodiversity hotspots, a paramount area for biodiversity conservation, and a repository of biological germplasm resources in China.
Scientists have been carrying out long-term observation of the forest biodiversity system of northwestern Yunnan, using technologies such as forest canopy tower crane and satellite remote sensing.
Similar to Fan, many of his colleagues consider the wilderness their home. Xu Kun, the deputy director of Lijiang station, and his team members spend nearly half a year in the field, conducting species surveys during the spring plant flowering season, gathering plant seeds in the fall, and organizing collected specimens and information in the winter.
""We have carried out observation surveys on species at an altitude of 2,000 to 4,500 meters in northwestern Yunnan to obtain first-hand data, and have now collected and preserved more than 2,600 important wild plant germplasm resources,"" Xu Kun said.
""We leverage bio-technology to address the reproductive challenges of endangered species, with the intent of reintroducing them into the wild for ecological reconstruction and restoration in the future,"" he added.
At present, the Lijiang station has been equipped with facilities such as the seed bank of wild plants and greenhouses, forming a complete research system including investigation, collection, preservation, research and development, and production.
The researchers have carried out collaborative research with scientists from Britain, the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan and other countries in various fields such as biodiversity conservation, plant diversity formation and evolution, and forest ecosystem function.
Furthermore, Chinese scientists are elevating biodiversity monitoring and conservation to new heights. The Yunnan Alpine Subnival Ecosystem Observation and Research Station at Baima Snow Mountain in Diqing, the highest scientific research observatory in Yunnan, has been established.
The station features meteorological observation fields and sample plots at altitudes of nearly 5,000 and 4,300 meters, furnishing robust scientific backing for biodiversity research and conservation.
According to Yang Yang, deputy director of Baima station, who has dedicated over two decades of work at Baima Snow Mountain, the oxygen content of the alpine zone is only about 70 percent of that at lower altitudes, and the region remains cold throughout the year, compelling plants to exhaust all their resources in order to thrive in this stressful environment. ""We hope to understand their survival mechanisms at high altitudes.""
""Additionally, the alpine glacial margin stands as one of the most vulnerable regions to global climate change, and we are keen to discern how plants in alpine habitats are reacting to these changes,"" Yang added.
Scientists have established a greenhouse at the Baima station and are planning simulated warming experiments to investigate the responses of the subnival plants to global warming, aiming to offer theoretical support and scientific guidance for the protection of these plants.
Moreover, scientists have established the Germplasms Bank of Wild Species at the KIB, the largest of its kind in Asia. Dubbed the ""Noah's Ark"" of plants in China, the seed bank preserved more than 94,000 plant seeds of over 11,000 species.
""Situated in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains region, we explore the phylogeny and evolutionary processes of plants, recognizing this region as one of the 36 most critical biodiversity areas globally,"" said Li Hongwei, deputy director of the KIB.
""The Earth's ecosystem shares a common destiny, and safeguarding natural biodiversity equates to securing the future of our species,"" Li added.

China's Chang'e-6 completes docking in lunar orbit with samples transferred to returner,2024-06-07,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0607/c90000-20178863.html,"Home>>
		
China's Chang'e-6 completes docking in lunar orbit with samples transferred to returner
 (Xinhua) 08:17, June 07, 2024
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The ascender of China's Chang'e-6 probe successfully rendezvoused and docked with the probe's orbiter-returner combination in lunar orbit at 2:48 p.m. (Beijing Time) on Thursday, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced.
The container carrying the world's first samples from the far side of the moon had been transferred from the ascender to the returner safely by 3:24 p.m., the CNSA said.
After the ascender took off from the far side of the moon on Tuesday morning and entered lunar orbit, it made four orbital adjustments. When the ascender was about 50 km in front of and 10 km above the orbiter-returner combination, the combination gradually approached the ascender through short-range autonomous control and captured it with holding claws.
This is the second time that Chinese spacecraft carried out rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit, with Chang'e-5 realizing the first one in 2020.
The orbiter-returner combination will later separate from the ascender and prepare to return to Earth at an appropriate time.
After the moon-Earth transfer and separation of the orbiter and returner, the returner is expected to land with lunar samples at Siziwang Banner in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as planned.
The Chang'e-6 probe, comprising an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner, was launched on May 3. Its lander-ascender combination touched down at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the moon's far side on June 2, and completed sampling in two days. The ascender, with precious samples, lifted off from the lunar surface and entered the preset lunar orbit on Tuesday morning.

Feature: Unfurling a flag made of ""stone"" on the moon

BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- While collecting lunar samples on the far side of the moon, China's Chang'e-6 mission thrilled the nation with a photo of the bright red Chinese national flag unfurled on the desolate lunar surface.
Even more interestingly, one of the flag's raw materials is basalt, which piqued the curiosity of netizens and sparked lively discussions on social media.
""Unbelievable! I thought making a national flag out of stone was something you'd only see in sci-fi novels,"" commented a user on China's popular social media Sina Weibo.
The China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), the main developer of the national flag display system, explained that during the journey to the moon, the Chang'e-6 probe faced intense radiation and extreme temperature fluctuations, making ordinary materials unsuitable for the lunar flag.
Basalt fiber boasts exceptional insulation and radiation resistance, making it ideal for withstanding the harsh conditions on the lunar surface. However, as an inorganic fiber, it is smooth and brittle, which makes it difficult to spin and maintain in high-durability colors, according to the CASIC.
The team of researchers from CASIC overcame many technical challenges to develop the national flag with superior corrosion resistance, high-temperature tolerance and low-temperature endurance by utilizing technologies such as basalt melting and drawing.
The basalt rocks came from Yuxian County in north China's Hebei Province. The team pulverized and melted the basalt rocks, then drew them into ultra-fine fibers roughly one-third the diameter of a human hair, before spinning them into threads and weaving the threads into fabrics, said Zhou Changyi, a designer of the Chang'e-6 probe.
The flag measures 300 mm by 200 mm, roughly the size of an A4 sheet of paper, and weighs only 11.3 grams, which is 0.5 grams lighter than the one carried by the Chang'e-5 mission to the near side of the moon in 2020.
The abundant basalt on the moon's surface could potentially be used to make fibers and construction materials for establishing a lunar base in the future, Zhou said.
The team also took measures to ensure the best imaging effect of the national flag.
""Lighting is crucial for the imaging effect,"" said Wang Bozhe, who works with the CASIC and is the technical leader of the Chang'e-6 national flag display system.
Given that Chang'e-6 touched down on the far side of the moon, where the lighting and angle of the flag surface differ from those of Chang'e-5, the team conducted multiple rounds of plan assessments and ground-based simulation tests to replicate lunar surface imaging conditions.
The team also evaluated and verified the lifespan of the national flag display system, ensuring its reliable operation on the far side of the moon.

Scientists design injectable, wireless sensor for brain signal monitoring
 (Xinhua) 14:01, June 06, 2024
WUHAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A team of researchers from China and Singapore has designed an implantable miniaturized sensor capable of conducting wireless ultrasonic monitoring of signals within the human skull.
In the clinical monitoring of physiological indicators like intracranial pressure, the use of conventional wired sensors demands surgical implantation. Additionally, the wireless sensors currently available are relatively large, requiring minimally invasive surgery.
The researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and Nanyang Technological University developed a hydrogel cube sensor, measuring just two millimeters in size, which can be implanted into the intracranial space using a puncture needle.
Upon injection, the hydrogel deforms in response to physiological environmental changes, which results in shifts of the peak frequency of the reflected ultrasound waves. These shifts can be non-invasively measured wirelessly by an external ultrasound probe, according to the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
The sensor is capable of independently measuring intracranial pressure, temperature, pH, and flow rate, with a detection depth reaching up to 10 centimeters.
The hydrogel maintains its stability for a period of three to four weeks, subsequently starting to degrade around the fifth week, and is nearly completely decomposed within 18 weeks, causing no systemic immune responses in rats.
Animal experiments on pigs have demonstrated that the sensor exhibits excellent sensing capabilities, comparable to those of conventional non-resorbable wired clinical benchmarks, according to the study.
""Our ultrasonic sensing technology is versatile and can be adapted for use beyond the brain,"" said Zang Jianfeng, one of the corresponding authors of the paper from the HUST.

Scientists identify new gene that may resist aging, kill pests
 (Xinhua) 10:24, June 06, 2024
HANGZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has identified a longevity gene that may potentially enhance human resistance to aging and become a new target for managing pests.
Mitochondria, as the powerhouses of the cell, play a pivotal role in cellular energy production and are closely linked to the aging process. Research on extending lifespan through optimizing mitochondrial function have garnered considerable interest across the scientific community.
Previous research has predominantly concentrated on the mitochondria, while comparatively less emphasis has been placed on the influence of cell nuclei, which have undergone a long-term co-evolutionary process alongside the mitochondria.
The researchers from Zhejiang University and the Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences under the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed evolutionary changes of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes from 472 insects, and identified 75 nuclear genes that co-evolve with mitochondrial genes.
They pinpointed four, including one called CG11837, and undertook experiments to diminish their activities in fruit flies.
The findings revealed that, in contrast to the control group, the diminished activity of these specific genes resulted in conspicuous alterations to the mitochondrial structure, according to the study published this week in the journal Nature Aging.
Furthermore, the team discovered a significant positive correlation between the activity of CG11837 and the lifespan of the organism.
They knocked down the gene across a spectrum of six distinct species, including brown plant hoppers, fruit flies and mosquitoes, and the gene suppression led to a pronounced shortening of their lifespans, with the diminution spanning from 25 to 59 percent.
In contrast, the overexpression of the gene is shown to extend median lifespans in fruit flies, according to the study.
Also, in vitro studies using human cells have shown that the activation of the CG11837 gene boosts their capacity to combat aging, achieving a 30 percent enhancement.
The CG11837 activation may emerge as a novel strategy for extending human lifespan, and in the agricultural sector, this gene knockdown could potentially serve as a new way for pest control, said the researchers.

Chinese scientists have for the first time developed a three-dimensional (3D) architected electronic skin, Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday, which the research team said could be applied to the skin like a band-aid to monitor real-time health data of people with potential applications in biomedical diagnosis and humanoid robots.
The electronic skin, developed by a research team led by Professor Zhang Yihui from Tsinghua University, can simultaneously decode and sense three mechanical signals, including pressure, friction and strain. The perception of the pressure position is also close to real skin.
""Electronic skin is actually a new type of sensor that mimics the sensory functions of human skin. In the future, it can be installed on the fingertips of medical robots for early diagnosis and treatment, and can also be applied like a band-aid to human skin to monitor health data such as blood oxygen and heart rate in real-time,"" Zhang said.
This bionic 3D electronic skin provides a new path for the development and application of electronic skin, with broad application prospects in industrial robotics, biological detection, biomedicine, and human-computer interaction.
Zhang explained that the reason why the skin is able to perceive mechanical signals is that it has a lot of tactile receptor cells that are densely arranged and have a three-dimensional spatial distribution, which can accurately perceive external stimuli. In the development of electronic skin, it is extremely challenging to recognize and decode pressure, friction and strain signals simultaneously to achieve accurate tactile sensing, as reported by Xinhua.
The team introduced that the bionic electronic skin developed consists of epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue, each of which is similar in texture to the corresponding layer in human skin.
Sensors and circuits are distributed both in deep and shallow parts of the skin, with some sensors closer to the skin surface and highly sensitive to external forces, while those distributed deeper are more sensitive to skin deformation, according to Xinhua. Zhang noted that an area of electronic skin the size of the tip of the index finger contains 240 metallic sensors.
When the electronic skin touches an external object, multiple inside sensors will work together. The signals collected by the sensors are processed through a series of transmissions and extractions, and then combined with deep learning algorithms to enable the electronic skin to accurately sense the softness, hardness and shape of the object.
The resulting technology is expected to be applied to freshness assessment, biomedical diagnosis, humanoid robots, prosthetic systems and other fields, according to Tsinghua University's official website.

"Fudan University to launch 100 AI courses, to drive innovation in industrial application",2024-06-06,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0606/c90000-20178558.html,"Home>>
		
Fudan University to launch 100 AI courses, to drive innovation in industrial application
By Liu Caiyu (Global Times) 09:46, June 06, 2024
Artificial intelligence (AI) education in China has been flourishing. Starting in September this year, Shanghai-based Fudan University will launch at least 100 AI courses during the upcoming academic year, with no less than 60 courses being offered in the fall semester of this year alone.
The innovative initiative aligns with the educational authorities' plan to enhance digital literacy nationwide, as well as with the country's AI development goals to cultivate AI talents that will drive innovation and growth across emerging industries.
""We are not establishing an artificial intelligence institute, but mobilizing all students to aim at the construction of a scientific intelligence innovation ecosystem,"" Chen Yan, Executive Vice Dean of the Graduate School of Fudan University, was quoted by media as saying that starting from the freshmen, the study plans for each degree program will clearly specify the requirements for cultivating AI literacy and capabilities. According to its official website, Fudan University has 15,303 undergraduate and 36,690 graduate students.
The scheme is to allow students to actively adapt to the widespread future use of scientific intelligence. Although it is difficult to predict how many industries will be related to AI in the future, what can be said is that mastering AI will lead students to better growth and success, according to a Fudan University statement published online.
A number of universities, along with multiple government departments including the Ministry of Education, have implemented an action plan to enhance digital literacy and skills. This collaborative approach is designed to establish a more extensive system for developing digital literacy and skills, promoting digital competency in schools, and advancing the digital economy.
The research and development of AI is not only related to digital literacy but also the major issues of human survival and development, Xiao Yanghua, a computer science professor from Fudan University, also director of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, told the Global Times when explaining the importance of integrating AI into university curriculum from a broad point of view.
We have never felt such a huge impact of AI on our understanding of ""people and society"" as we do today. AI doesn't just bring tools, but major opportunities to reshape traditional humanities, thus the integration of AI into various other curriculums is essential to redefine our education in this new era, Xiao further said.
Echoed Xiao, Zhu Rongsheng, an expert from Tsinghua University's Center for International Security and Strategy, told the Global Times that not only universities have been making efforts to integrate AI into their daily curriculums, but also the schools. Nurturing AI talent firstly is about equipping them with the most advanced technology and allowing them to adapt to the fast-changing AI era when they walk out of campus, more importantly, is planting seeds for technological breakthroughs that will benefit the country's AI industrial development in the long term.
Earlier in February, Nanjing University announced a pioneering move, launching an AI general curriculum aimed at fostering AI literacy among all new students. Its curriculum is structured around a compulsory AI core course, supplemented by a series of AI literacy courses and interdisciplinary courses that deeply integrate AI with various academic disciplines.
Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications also announced recently that all undergraduate freshmen entering this year will receive general education training in AI, with mandatory courses such as introduction to AI, introduction to computing, and design thinking.
Based on the AI education at Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Fudan AI classes will launch AI-basic courses, AI-essential courses, AI-subject courses and AI-thematic courses targeting the vertical application of AI.
The goal of the professional AI essential courses is to cultivate top innovative talent in the field of AI, and studying this course requires a professional foundation in artificial intelligence. Currently, 64 teaching professors have been recruited from more than 10 colleges and research institutes across the university. Also, in September of this year, at least 10 AI-thematic courses with industrial application scenarios will be launched, according to PLA Daily.

Talent is the cornerstone of progress in each cutting-edge technology, new model, and emerging industry. From robot engineers ensuring machines can understand and perform tasks correctly, to intelligent manufacturing technicians setting up automated production lines, and digital twin engineers turning massive factories into ""virtual plants,"" a steady supply of talents is essential.
In April, China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, along with eight other government departments, unveiled a three-year plan to foster talents to drive the growth of the Chinese digital economy.
The initiative aims to accelerate the cultivation of digital expertise to support the digital economy. It focuses on the needs of the digital industry and relevant industries, aiming to increase the supply of skilled digital professionals from 2024 to 2026.
Zhang Hongchao, a doctoral student majoring in microelectronics and solid state electronics at Beihang University, will become a component developer of a microelectronics company after graduation this summer.
""I think integrated circuit companies are facing a substantial shortage of digital talents, especially those with rich experience,"" Zhang told People's Daily. Since October 2021, he has been working for a Beijing-based memory chip enterprise as an intern while engaging in research projects at the university, gaining abundant experience. That's why he has been ""booked"" by the company long before his graduation.
In the job market, there is a growing demand for new professions such as digital managers, business data analysts, smart building administrators, blockchain application operators, internet marketers, and digital twin application technicians. Experienced digital professionals are highly sought after by companies.

China's emergence as one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the world contributes to this surging demand. The scale of China's digital economy has grown to 50.2 trillion yuan (about 7.25 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2022, and the share of the digital economy in the country's GDP has risen to 41.5 percent.
According to the latest report on the development of Digital China released by the National Data Administration, the value-added output of core industries in the digital economy reached 10 percent of China's total GDP in 2023.
The rapidly developing digital economy in China has led to a steady demand for digital talents. It is estimated that a gap requiring about 25 million to 30 million digitalization professionals needs to be filled to meet the demand of China's digital economy. In particular, there is a soaring need for professionals in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent manufacturing, semiconductors, and big data.
The industry is seeing a huge demand for professionals, but fresh graduates often lack the necessary skills and practical experience. To better match the two ends and nurture versatile talents proficient in both technology and industry development, it is important to accelerate cooperation and collaboration between enterprises and universities.
Recently, technology experts from Chinese e-commerce giant Meituan gave a course on AI technologies for instant delivery to students from the Department of Automation and the Department of Industrial Engineering of Tsinghua University.
The course includes AI-driven modeling and decision optimization methods within complex systems, and their specific applications in instant delivery. It was co-taught by Jia Qingshan, a professor with Tsinghua University's Department of Automation, and Meituan's technology experts.

Students said the course combined theory and practice, helping them master the application of AI technologies in automated and intelligent decision-making in real industrial scenarios.
It is reported that Meituan and Tsinghua University established the Tsinghua University-Meituan Joint Institute for Digital Life in 2021. So far, they have initiated dozens of research cooperation projects and launched long-term courses such as one about commercial application and practice of big data technology.
In recent years, a number of new majors such as robotics engineering, intelligent manufacturing engineering, unmanned aerial vehicle system engineering, intelligent material technology, and intelligent vision engineering have become popular choices in universities.
To enhance practical learning, universities have been introducing industry experts to co-teach courses, establishing joint laboratories with enterprises, setting up internship and practical training bases, and encouraging collaboration between university and industry mentors to guide student projects. These practical initiatives are becoming increasingly common.
Experts said that the digital industry is characterized by rapid technological updates, which leads to ever-changing demand for talents. Thus, adapting to new technologies and changes through university-enterprise collaboration, such as offering customized training programs and company-sponsored classes, is crucial.
Additionally, conducting digital vocational skill certification programs in leading enterprises and vocational institutions, establishing comprehensive digital occupational standards and evaluation systems, and cultivating an ecosystem for nurturing digital talents are vital pathways to drive the development of the digital economy.

Chinese scientists design bio-inspired 3D e-skin,2024-06-05,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0605/c90000-20178241.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists design bio-inspired 3D e-skin
 (Xinhua) 14:46, June 05, 2024
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has created the world's first bio-inspired electronic skin with a 3D structure that mimics three mechanical signals found in human skin.
With its intricate 3D distribution, sensory receptors in human skin adeptly perceive external forces and strain. By mimicking this spatial distribution, researchers from Tsinghua University developed an e-skin that replicates the structure of human skin, featuring its own ""epidermis,"" ""dermis"" and ""subcutaneous tissue.""
This e-skin is capable of achieving simultaneous decoding and perception of three mechanical signals -- pressure, friction and strain -- at the physical level, according to the study published in the journal Science recently.
""A patch of the e-skin, comparable in size to the tip of an index finger, is equipped with 240 metal sensors, each ranging from two to three hundred micrometers in size,"" said Zhang Yihui, the corresponding author of the study.
""Their spatial arrangement closely mimics the distribution of tactile receptor cells within human skin,"" Zhang added.
The sensors amass signals that are meticulously processed and subsequently refined through deep learning algorithms, allowing the biomimetic skin to discern the texture and contours of objects with remarkable precision.
It exhibits a remarkable pressure position perception resolution of about 0.1 millimeters, rivaling the sensitivity of genuine human skin, according to the study.
The e-skin holds the potential to be integrated into the fingertips of medical robots for precise early-stage diagnostics and interventions. It can also be used as a band-aid to offer real-time monitoring of vital health metrics, including blood oxygen saturation and heart rate, according to Zhang.
