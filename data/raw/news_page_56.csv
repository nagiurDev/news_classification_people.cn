URUMQI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The drilling of a superdeep borehole in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region reached 10,000 meters at 2:48 p.m. Monday and is going deeper, marking a breakthrough in the country's deep-Earth exploration.
Located in the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert in the Tarim Basin, the ""Shenditake 1"" is expected to reach a designed depth of 11,100 meters upon completion. It is China's first scientific exploration borehole designed to exceed a depth of 10,000 meters.
Since the start of drilling on May 30, 2023, the borehole has penetrated 13 continental strata, with more than 1,000 drill pipes driven into the Earth and over 20 drill bits consumed in the process.
""It is the first time that China has drilled a vertical borehole over 10,000 meters deep,"" said Wang Chunsheng, chief expert of the Tarim Oilfield of China National Petroleum Corporation, which is in charge of the drilling.
Located between the Tianshan and the Kunlun mountains, the Tarim Basin is one of the most difficult areas to explore due to its harsh ground environment and complicated underground conditions.
Wang said that after reaching 10,000 meters, the drilling will face more severe challenges such as temperatures of over 200 degrees Celsius and formation pressure exceeding 130 MPa, and the difficulty will multiply with each meter drilled deeper.
The deepest vertical well in the world today has a depth of more than 12,262 meters. Jia Chengzao, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the ""Shenditake 1"" has become the second deepest vertical well worldwide and the deepest in Asia, and is of milestone significance in deep-Earth scientific research and ultra-deep oil and gas exploration.

AI technology in spotlight during two sessions
 (Global Times) 13:03, March 04, 2024
As the global artificial intelligence (AI) industry kicks off a new wave of development enthusiasm, AI technology is set to be a hot topic during the two sessions, with a number of members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee saying that in the AI arena, China should adhere to independent innovation, as the country is capable of taking a development path of large language models (LLMs) with Chinese characteristics.
Xu Jiuping, a member of the CPPCC National Committee and professor at Sichuan University, said on Sunday in a note sent to the Global Times that the Chinese market has the world's largest number of users and active data-producing entities, which is enough to shape many complex new businesses and services. This situation can provide a place for advanced AI technologies and inspire Chinese companies to innovate.
""In the field of AI, we can learn from the experience and practices of organizations such as OpenAI, but we should also find another way to explore more advanced AI technologies,"" Xu said, noting that the US is not the endgame for AI, and China should insist on independent innovation.
""This kind of ingenuity does not mean getting stuck in a rut, but rather exploring autonomous directions to better serve new needs and promote the international competitiveness of original technologies,"" Xu said.
China has a huge market and talent reserves, and the population base and sound software and hardware infrastructure also provide a good foundation for data collection. ""We should give full play to the spirit of Chinese people who dare to explore and create, in a bid to explore AI technology with the unique scientific ideas of Chinese people,"" Xu noted.
Zhou Hongyi, another member of the CPPCC National Committee and founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology, said in a note sent to the Global Times that it will take time for China to catch up with the US in the core technology of LLMs.
In terms of LLM application, Zhou noted that China can walk the path of LLM development with Chinese characteristics.
""An important direction for the development of LLMs in China should focus on leveraging the advantages of the industry and various scenarios, combining LLMs with business processes and product functions, and seeking multi-scenario applications, in a bid to accelerate the formation of new productive forces,"" Zhou noted.
LLMs are like engines, which should be integrated with business activities. Especially in the traditional manufacturing industry, LLMs are powerful tools to promote a digital transformation, Zhou noted.
""Authorities can encourage enterprises to integrate one or two business scenarios with an LLM, thus creating a number of LLMs that can be used across the country, which will have a huge effect on China's industrial digitalization and essentially become an important part of the new productive forces,"" Zhou said.
China's leading digital economy with its large-scale data resources, diverse data types and rich application scenarios have provided advantages for the country's AI sector, Qi Xiangdong, chairman of Qi An Xin Technology Group, who is also a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, told the Global Times on Friday.
Qi said that AI depends on data, and China's rapidly developing digital economy provides a large source of data. He added that the total scale of China's digital economy reached 50.2 trillion yuan ($6.97 trillion) in 2022, and the breadth and depth of digital integration in the real economy has expanded.

Song Xiaoming, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the head of the Second Academy of CASIC, told the Global Times on Sunday that the Weihai-1 laser-based communication payload has successfully undergone the satellite-ground communication technology verification, laying ground for new experiment works.
The payloads, developed by the 25th Institute under the Second Academy of CASIC together with the Harbin Institute of Technology's Weihai Campus, were onboard the Weihai-1/-2 satellites launched on February 3 atop the commercial firm China Rocket's Jielong-3 rocket.
The second session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), the top legislature, and the second session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top political advisory body, will open on March 5 and 4, respectively. Collectively, they are known as two sessions.
According to Song on Sunday, just one day before the two sessions officially kick off, with the rapid development of the marine economy, China's demand for large-capacity and real-time transmission of marine data is on the rise. The Weihai-1 project is designed to assist in marine remote sensing applications, elevating the ""information highway"" to a ""high-speed lane,"" Song said.
In recent years, the real-time acquisition of marine information and fishing vessel management has been a key issue restricting the development of coastal cities. The on-orbit application of the Weihai-1 laser communication terminal will provide an important breakthrough in addressing this challenge, Song noted.
The Weihai-1 laser communication payloads, relying on high-precision targeting, capture and tracking, atmospheric turbulence correction, and other technical advantages, will realize real-time transmission of large-capacity marine remote sensing data and fishing vessel monitoring data through laser ""relay"" by multiple satellites.
Its communication capacity can reach hundreds of times that of traditional microwave methods, equivalent to transmitting a high-definition movie in every second, successfully extending the application of laser communication to the field of marine remote sensing and management, Song explained.
The launch and on-orbit verification of the Wehai-1 marks an important exploration of the CAISC Second Academy's laser communication technology in the field of marine information applications, the CASIC lauded in a statement it provided to the Global Times.
The academy will construct a high-performance, reliable product line of inter-satellite and satellite-ground high-speed communications, contributing to the construction of a strong aerospace nation, it vowed.
While ensuring social, economic, and livelihood needs, the academy is also providing aerospace capabilities to support the joint construction of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with the power of its technology.
Over the past decade, the CASIC' Second Academy has provided various types and dozens of sets of meteorological equipment and tens of thousands of radiosondes to countries such as Pakistan and Malaysia.
It has hosted more than 30 visiting exchange groups from BRI-participating countries, organized over 50 international science and technology exchange and cooperation seminars, participated in more than 30 large-scale international meteorological commercial exhibitions, and showcased the latest comprehensive meteorological detection technologies and equipment from aerospace ""integration of space, air, land, and sea,"" continuously strengthening meteorological cooperation with these countries, according to the CASIC.
Setting sail for another decade, the academy continues to advance the deepening and solidification of the joint construction of the BRI through international cooperation, continuously promoting the guarantee of meteorological detection equipment and data services.
In 2024, the CASIC Second Academy will implement the construction task of multiple automatic meteorological stations at Gwadar Port in Pakistan, providing meteorological services for the BRIF flagship project of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor construction.

Political advisors propose including assisted reproductive treatment expenses in national medical insurance,2024-03-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0304/c90000-20140206.html,"Home>>
		
Political advisors propose including assisted reproductive treatment expenses in national medical insurance
 (Global Times) 11:06, March 04, 2024
While some provinces and cities in China have included assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in their medical insurance as part of supportive policies to encourage childbirth over the past year, some political advisors to the ongoing two sessions proposed optimizing the current maternity insurance system and including assisted reproductive treatment expenses in the national medical insurance.
After the national healthcare security authorities proposed in July 2022 gradually incorporating some ART into medical insurance, some places such as Beijing and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region started including 16 therapeutic assisted reproductive technology procedures and eight assisted reproductive technology procedures like oocyte retrieval in the scope of medical insurance payment, respectively.
However, as only four provinces, regions, or municipalities across the country have included some ART procedures in medical insurance reimbursement, it has failed to benefit all groups in need, and insured individuals from different regions enjoy inconsistent treatment safeguards, Xu Ruixia, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and deputy head of the department of human resources and social security of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said in a proposal sent to the Global Times on Monday.
The political advisor suggested including as many ART procedures as possible in the national medical insurance reimbursement scope, including artificial insemination, embryo transplantation, and sperm selection. These procedures involve a wide range of people and are necessary steps in medical treatment.
She also proposed that many diagnostic tests for the causes of infertility, such as semen analysis, should be included in the national medical insurance reimbursement scope. This encourages patients to seek medical treatment early, reducing the likelihood of infertility patients delaying treatment due to economic reasons or wishful thinking, Xu said.
The CPPCC member also suggested strengthening the standardized management of medical institutions' reimbursement projects for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility.
China's population decreased by 2.08 millionpeople in 2023 to 1.40967 billion, as per data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday. In 2023, 9.02 million babies were born, resulting in a birth rate of 6.39 per thousand people.
The birth rate marked a historic low in nearly 74 years (since 1950), and the population has experienced two consecutive years of negative growth, with a total fertility rate of around 1.0, significantly lower than the average total fertility rate of major countries globally during the same period (ranging from 1.47 to 1.65), Xu said in the proposal.
The proportion of infertility in China has increased from 1 to 2 percent in the 1970s to 12.5 to 15 percent three decades later, marking a nearly tenfold increase over 30 years. According to statistics, in 2023, the incidence of infertility in China has risen to 18 percent, with approximately 1 in every 5 to 6 couples experiencing difficulties with conception. This means that over 50 million couples nationwide are affected by infertility issues, the CPPCC member said.
Faced with expensive ART procedures costing over 100,000 yuan ($13,895) per case, Xu said it's necessary to include ART treatment in medical insurance to boost the birth rate and alleviate economic pressure.
Ahead of the two sessions, another political advisor, Zhao Changlong from North China’s Tianjin, proposed adjusting the current maternity insurance system to a national maternity insurance system to ensure universal coverage for all citizens.
Additionally, Zhao suggested establishing a well-balanced and strategically distributed system for ART services, promoting epidural anesthesia during childbirth, and gradually including related expenses in the scope of medical insurance or providing policy incentives. Furthermore, exploring the feasibility of egg-freezing for single womencould also be considered at an appropriate time.
Due to changes in attitudes toward marriage and childbirth, some single women are beginning to freeze their eggs as a means of postponing reproduction, preserving fertility, and asserting their reproductive rights. However, issues related to technology, law, ethics, and others remain unresolved, Zhao was quoted as saying in media reports.
The political advisor suggested that with advancements in science and technology, improvements in overall social morality, and the enhancement of legal systems, it is appropriate to explore the feasibility of egg freezing for single women, according to the reports.

A three-dimensional nanoscale optical disk memory with petabit capacity has been developed at the Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, according to an article published on Feb. 22 in Nature.
The research team managed to increase the capacity of optical data storage to the petabit level by extending the planar recording architecture to three dimensions with hundreds of layers, while also breaking the optical diffraction limit barrier of the recorded spots. The minimum spot size and lateral track pitch are 54 nm and 70 nm, respectively.
The team developed an optical recording medium based on a photoresist film doped with aggregation-induced emission dye, which can be optically stimulated by femtosecond laser beams.
The new technology marks the world's first achievement of a petabit-level capacity optical disk.

"Tech innovations enhance wildlife conservation on ""roof of the world""",2024-03-04,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0304/c90000-20140025.html,"Home>>
		
Tech innovations enhance wildlife conservation on ""roof of the world""
 (Xinhua) 08:22, March 04, 2024
XINING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- On the eastern edge of northwest China's Hoh Xil, a nature reserve encompassing the country's largest area of uninhabited land within the Sanjiangyuan National Park, stands a striking statue of a Tibetan antelope against the backdrop of the azure sky.
This symbolic figure marks the first protection station in the region. Established in 1997, the Sonam Dargye Protection Station pays homage to a renowned guardian of Hoh Xil and now spearheads wildlife conservation efforts in the area. Sonam Dargye, a government official and advocate for wildlife preservation, tragically lost his life in 1994 at the hands of antelope poachers who turned their weapons against him.
Though Sonam Dargye has passed, his spirit endures. Thirty years on, his extraordinary commitment has inspired more people in Hoh Xil to guard this land with passion and dedication. ""I heard about his deeds at a very young age, and I was deeply moved. I was determined to follow in his footsteps and become a guardian of this land,"" said Tsering Lozang, 24, the youngest ranger at the Sonam Dargye Protection Station. Last June, after graduating from university, he arrived at Hoh Xil to take on this job.
For the new generation of rangers like Tsering Lozang who patrol the expansive plateau landscape, beyond the spiritual inspiration, a string of new technologies deployed in biodiversity conservation in Hoh Xil also play a crucial role in their routine work on the ""roof of the world.""
On this year's World Wildlife Day, observed on Sunday, attention has turned to the remarkable progress achieved in these nearly uninhabited areas, with an average altitude of over 4,600 meters, as well as the pivotal role played by advanced technology in safeguarding wildlife.

Nestled deep in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, the Hoh Xil nature reserve had long grappled with a dearth of communication signals, save for the route along the Qinghai-Xizang Highway.
The convenience of sending frequent updates to colleagues and sharing photos of Tibetan antelopes roaming in the wilderness was once unimaginable for many rangers in the nature reserve. ""Entering the nature reserve meant being isolated from the outside world, especially in the Zonag Lake area. We could only contact families through expensive satellite phones,"" recalled Tsesogyal, a 28-year-old ranger in Hoh Xil.
During the last Tibetan antelope breeding season, a 5G base station began operations at the protection station near Zonag Lake, known as the ""delivery room"" for Tibetan antelopes, a species under first-class state protection in China.
This marked the expansion of the 5G network throughout the core territory of this UNESCO natural heritage site. Now it is possible to livestream one of the world's most breathtaking scenes, migrations of hoofed animals, to the global audience.
According to Zhan Jianglong, a local forest police official, the change still feels ""like a dream."" ""Having cellphone signals in the wilderness used to be unbelievable,"" he said. Nowadays, there is uninterrupted 5G signal, with the peak internet speed reaching 860 Mbps.
""In the past, communication with the outside world was difficult during the journey. Now, when we reach the area near Zonag Lake, everyone can easily call their families and colleagues via phone or WeChat,"" Zhan said.
As early as 2016, Qinghai Province began to build a networked, remote real-time observation system to strengthen the monitoring and protection of key ecological areas.
Known as the ""window of ecology,"" the remote monitoring system has 76 observation points across the area. It can not only closely observe and study the migration process of Tibetan antelopes but also facilitate data collection and observation of rare wildlife species, providing detailed data support for biodiversity conservation in the Sanjiangyuan National Park.

""It is a significant step in Sanjiangyuan National Park's pursuit of intelligent ecological protection,"" said Sun Lijun, deputy director of the Sanjiangyuan National Park administration.
Sun noted that based on the geographical factors and ecological monitoring requirements, the park chose to set up the 5G base station in the Zonag Lake area, which can better monitor the migration and delivery of Tibetan antelopes.
According to deputy station chief Guo Xuehu, staffers of the nature reserve rescue many Tibetan antelope calves separated from their herds at the Zonag Lake Protection Station every year. ""Now, when a calf falls ill, we can also use video calls to connect with veterinarians, who can guide the treatment remotely.""
""Livestreaming Tibetan antelope migration and birth also helps foster public awareness for biodiversity conservation,"" Sun added.
According to local authorities, more 5G base stations are expected to be built in the nature reserve, while the combination of 5G remote inspection, on-site patrol and helicopter patrol will be introduced to bolster the anti-poaching and monitoring capabilities of the reserve.

Research on Tibetan antelopes, one of the flagship species on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, has always been important for protecting the plateau's biodiversity, according to Lian Xinming, a researcher at the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Hailing the technological advancements in wildlife conservation atop the ""roof of the world,"" Lian noted that in the future, AI technology can be used to monitor the reproductive status of Tibetan antelopes. This approach would reduce human resource input and statistical errors, thus enhancing the efficiency of ecological protection and scientific research in Hoh Xil.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhou-17 crew aboard China's orbiting space station carried out their second extravehicular mission on Saturday, the China Manned Space Agency has said.
Taikonauts Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin successfully completed all assigned tasks at 1:32 p.m. (Beijing time), after approximately eight hours of extravehicular activities. They worked together closely with the support of the space station's robotic arm and scientific researchers on Earth.
A spacewalk was conducted by Tang Hongbo and Jiang Xinlin, who have since returned safely to the Wentian lab module.
China launched the Shenzhou-17 manned spaceship on Oct. 26, 2023. Its crew conducted a repair test in their first extravehicular mission on Dec. 21 last year.
During their second extravehicular mission, the three taikonauts completed maintenance work on the Tianhe core module's solar wings, addressing the impact of small space particles. According to the agency, the solar wing's power generation function is operating normally after evaluation and analysis.
It was the first time the taikonauts completed the in-orbit maintenance of extravehicular facilities. The Shenzhou-17 crew also inspected the status of the space station's modules during their spacewalk.
The three taikonauts are scheduled to carry out a variety of space science and technology experiments during the remainder of their space journey, the agency said.

Chinese scientists propose new solutions for fast-charging lithium-ion batteries
 (Xinhua) 10:36, March 02, 2024
HANGZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists has developed a design of electrolytes capable of promoting the charging rate and expanding the operating temperature of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Nature.
This new design can enable lithium-ion batteries to achieve reversibility when the cells are charged and discharged in a wide temperature range from minus 70 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius. The lithium-ion batteries can also be charged and discharged within just 10 minutes at room temperature, according to the study.
According to Fan Xiulin, a professor at the School of Materials Science and Engineering of Zhejiang University, the charging rate, operating temperature, and safety of lithium-ion batteries are complex issues for further developing electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles require high density, fast charging and a wide operating temperature range, the study noted.
With this new design of electrolytes, lithium-ion batteries are capable of reaching an 80 percent charge within 10 minutes, said Fan.
Fan's team devised solvent-screening strategies, screening out 23 solvents from tens of thousands of solvents to prepare electrolytes for studying lithium-ion batteries. Following four years of research, they pinpointed the optimal electrolyte formula.
According to him, this new achievement will further promote the development of green and low-carbon energy.

China's agricultural fields grow seeds of sci-tech progress,2024-03-01,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0301/c90000-20139277.html,"Home>>
		
China's agricultural fields grow seeds of sci-tech progress
 (Xinhua) 10:18, March 01, 2024
BEIJING, Feb. 29 (Xinhua) -- In the Taigu District of the city of Jinzhong, north China's Shanxi Province, tall and bright vegetable greenhouses standing next to each other have hosted busy workers before the Spring Festival this year.
With a total area of 330,000 mu (about 22,000 hectares) for grain planting, a 60,000 mu facility for vegetable growing, and an annual output of 300,000 tonnes of livestock products, Taigu has become known for agriculture.
""Our current efforts are aimed at increasing the production of pumpkins,"" said Shi Jingnan, manager of Taigu Defeng Seed Co., Ltd. The company has found an all-female strain, which is expected to be used in developing hybrid pumpkin seeds to deliver a major yield breakthrough.
TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES EVIDENT IN FIELDS
In Hancun Village of Taigu, villagers participated in agricultural technology development by applying research outcomes in the fields and sending feedback to researchers.
The upgrading of seed technology is inseparable from large-scale planting, according to Shi. ""Farmers have true ideas of the advantages and disadvantages of an agricultural product.""
""They hoped to diversify the ripening season of pumpkins, and so we developed early and extremely early varieties,"" Shi said. ""We also maintain the size and weight of the products within a stable range.""
From single varieties to hybrids, the company combined traditional breeding methods and high-tech solutions to cultivate a group of high-quality pumpkin and zucchini seeds, which were introduced to overseas markets.
In a biological breeding research center in Taigu, a seed selection center, experimental production base, promotion and trading platform, and germplasm resource storage facility have combined to greatly improve the innovation ability of the seed industry.
China unveiled its ""No. 1 central document"" for 2024 earlier this month, outlining the priorities for comprehensively promoting rural revitalization this year.
The document called for consolidating support for agricultural science and technology and intensifying research concerning the core technologies of germplasm resources.
The development of seeds is a vivid illustration of the significant agricultural advances made in Taigu. This district has cultivated 44,460 mu of high-standard farmland, which accounts for more than 66 percent of total farmland in the district, and has developed a 24,400 mu efficient water-saving irrigation area, thanks to facilities and equipment upgrading initiatives based on science and technology.
All this work is to make pumpkins more marketable and increase the income of farmers. The net profit of each vegetable planting greenhouse reached 100,000 yuan (about 13,900 U.S. dollars) in 2023, said Cheng Xiaowu, head of a village committee in Taigu. Some village households in this district have crops growing in as many as five greenhouses.
INDUSTRY ADVANCE VIA TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
The introduction of modern science and technology has made traditional agriculture more efficient and effectively improved agricultural production methods.
Mountain monorail transport trucks, loaded with fertilizer and farm tools, climbed steadily along a track to the terraces of olive trees in Wudu District of the city of Longnan, northwest China's Gansu Province.
A single journey by one such truck carries a load of up to 200 kilograms, said Zhao Haiyun, an official with the district. It takes only 11 minutes to climb 500 meters, which means this innovation has effectively eased transportation challenges in terms of both production materials and agricultural products in mountainous areas with steep or extensive slopes.
Longnan has completed a total of 66.7 kilometers of mountain monorail transport tracks consisting of 106 lines.
With only seven percent of the world's arable land, China feeds about 20 percent of the global population and has made remarkable progress in agricultural development, said Yu Ningkai, director of the rural development institute under the Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences
Over thousands of years of Chinese agricultural development, each upgrade in farm tool technology has resulted in progress in human agricultural civilization, Yu added.
A biological pesticide made of materials based on Traditional Chinese Medicine, combined with modern biopharmaceutical methods, is being promoted in more than 10 provinces nationwide, including Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Fujian. It has been widely used for the cultivation of vegetables and Chinese medicinal herbs, covering a planting area of nearly 3.6 million mu.
Biopesticides are natural, said Shen Tong, a professor with Lanzhou Jiaotong University in Gansu. They can effectively control crop diseases and pests as well as ensure food safety and protect the agricultural environment.
China is witnessing continuous research and development in terms of new agricultural technologies, which are beefing up industrial modernization upgrading in the country.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the contribution rate of agricultural scientific and technological progress exceeded 62 percent in 2022, with the overall mechanization rate of crop cultivation and harvesting reaching 73 percent.

Scientists develop anti-fatigue 3D-printed titanium alloy,2024-02-29,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0229/c90000-20138912.html,"Home>>
		
Scientists develop anti-fatigue 3D-printed titanium alloy
 (Xinhua) 14:44, February 29, 2024
SHENYANG, Feb. 29 (Xinhua) -- A team of international scientists has broken through the technological bottleneck caused by the poor fatigue properties of 3D-printed materials, and proposed an innovative strategy to fabricate an anti-fatigue titanium alloy via near void-free 3D printing.
According to the study published in the latest issue of academic journal Nature, the advantage of 3D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM) technology, had previously been severely compromised by the poor fatigue performance of 3D-printed materials under cyclic loading, which resulted from the presence of microvoids induced by prevailing printing process.
To solve the problem, the research team under the leadership of Prof. Zhang Zhefeng and Prof. Zhang Zhenjun from the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, managed to successfully produce an approximate void-free Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy by developing a new 3D-printing processing technique to regulate microstructure and defects separately.
This new technique, known as Net-Additive Manufacturing Process, includes hot-isostatic pressing to eliminate the microvoids and subsequent high-temperature-short-time heat treatment to restore the AM microstructure with fine martensite lath, which can successfully restore a nearly void-free Net-AM microstructure to the titanium alloy.
The team confirmed the fatigue resistance of such a void-free 3D-printed titanium alloy, and found that it exceeded the level of resistance of all other 3D-printed and forged titanium alloys as well as that of other metallic materials.
""This research has revised people's previous understanding of the low fatigue performance of 3D printing materials and is expected to advance such materials' application in aerospace and other fields,"" said Zhang Zhefeng.
