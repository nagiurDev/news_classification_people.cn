Scientists build genome database for ""drying without dying"" plants
 (Xinhua) 15:44, December 25, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- Drying but not dying -- some plants in nature have this ""special function."" Recently, Chinese scientists created a genomic database for these desiccation-tolerant plants.
The study, led by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, was published in the journal Plant Physiology.
Desiccation is typically fatal, but a small number of terrestrial plants have acquired vegetative desiccation tolerance (VDT), which allows them to dry without dying and to be revived when exposed to water, according to the research.
The scientists then decided to create the ""Drying without Dying"" database which stores genome annotations and transcriptomes of desiccation-tolerant plants to aid in the finding of desiccation tolerance gene resource discovery.
The database contains a total of 16 VDT-related plant genomes, including 10 mosses, and incorporates 10 genomes that are closely related to VDT plants.
According to the research, over the past decade advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the investigation of genomes for desiccation-tolerant plants. However, there is a lack of these valuable genomic resources in the dedicated and integrated database.
""We expect this initial release of the 'Drying without Dying' plant genome database to help facilitate future discovery of VDT genetic resources,"" said the study.

KUNMING, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a highway service zone in southwest China's Yunnan Province has been suspended after paleontological fossils were discovered at the site.
The fossils were discovered at the construction site of a service area in the Malong District of the city of Qujing, when a fossil collector revealed in late November that rubble at this site possibly contained fossils of ancient creatures.
The man, surnamed Yang, soon reported his suspicions to local authorities. Experts later confirmed that fossils including malungia laevigata, isoxys, naraoia, bradoriids and hyolithoid were found in the debris. These fossils date back to around 500 million years ago.
According to Liu Yu, a researcher with the Institute of Palaeontology at Yunnan University, the fossils are valuable to scientific studies, with relatively well-preserved exoskeletons found in most of the fossils.
He noted that it was not surprising to discover fossils in Malong, as Malong fauna was named after this district, which has attracted lots of researchers and fossil collectors over the years.
Yang, who started collecting fossils in 2015, said he had already found fossils with more than 1,000 intact malungia laevigata. ""In some rocks there are as many as 20 such creatures,"" he said, adding that he is now in contact with local authorities to find a home for the fossils he collected.
Leng Tao, a manager of the highway construction project, told Xinhua that they have suspended their work at the site since the end of November. ""It certainly affects construction progress, but it is significant for the protection of the paleontological fossils,"" he said.
Experts believe that new discoveries are possible at the site. According to the Department of Natural Resources of Yunnan, excavation efforts will be launched.

Nation powering ahead on renewables
By Zheng Xin (China Daily) 08:13, December 25, 2023

China's installed renewable energy capacity exceeded 50 percent of its total installed power generation capacity this year, marking the early completion of a government target, in which renewable capacity was planned to exceed that of fossil fuel by 2025, said analysts.
According to the National Energy Administration, the installed capacity of renewable energy has so far exceeded that of thermal power, reaching more than 1.45 billion kilowatts. Solar and wind power meanwhile play a major role, with installed capacity exceeding 1 billion kW.
China has been actively stepping up efforts to build its renewable energy power base in the country's Gobi Desert and other arid regions this year, taking advantage of the abundant wind and solar resources while ensuring a sufficient green power supply in the country's load center in eastern areas.
By the end of November, the first batch of projects had been completed and connected to the grid, with a total capacity of 45.16 million kW. The second and third batches, totaling over 50 million kW, have been approved and some are currently under construction, it said.
Lin Boqiang, head of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, said that China's advances in scaling up its renewable energy capacity and reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels position the country as a global leader in renewable energy deployment.
""However, consumption of renewable energy in China still has substantial potential, as it only accounts for a small part of power consumption,"" Lin said.
Power generated from wind and solar sources now accounts for more than 15 percent of China's total electricity consumption, up from 13.8 percent last year, said the NEA.
Kou Nannan, head of China Research at BloombergNEF, said that most sources of new energy are intermittent and have rapid and random variables, making it difficult to maintain stable and steady power generation and posing a threat to the steady operation of the power grid.
Policy support, power market reform, investment in infrastructure such as upgrading and expansion of the power grid, as well as the development of energy storage, will play key roles in accelerating China's green and low-carbon energy transformation in the years to come, he said.
In recent years, China has been accelerating the development of new energy storage, which can help store excess energy generated by renewable sources for use during periods of low generation, to facilitate the nation's development of renewable energy.
The NEA said that over 24 million kW of new energy storage projects have been completed and become operational this year.
China has also been stepping up energy security with a steadily increasing energy supply this year. The annual addition of power generation capacity was approximately 330 million kW, reaching a total installed capacity of 2.9 billion kW, a year-on-year growth of 12.9 percent, it said.
The administration has pledged to further enhance energy supply guarantee capabilities in the next year, focusing on maintaining crude oil production at a stable level of over 200 million metric tons and sustaining positive momentum in domestic natural gas production.
Annual crude oil production remains stable at over 200 million tons this year, and natural gas production exceeded 230 billion cubic meters, with a year-on-year growth of over 4.5 percent, the NEA said.

Chinese researchers develop new technology for propylene production
 (Xinhua) 14:14, December 23, 2023
HANGZHOU, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research team has developed a new molecular sieve material for separating propylene from propane, according to Zhejiang University.
Propylene is the raw material found in chemical products such as plastics, home appliances, medical devices, synthetic fibers and cosmetics. However, There is a high degree of difficulty in separating propylene from propane during industrial production.
A molecular sieve only allows smaller molecules to enter, thus blocking larger molecules, said Xing Huabin with Zhejiang University, leader of the research.
The research team has developed a fast, efficient and low-carbon molecular sieve material ZU-609 that only allows propylene molecules to enter and blocks propane molecules.
The results are expected to significantly reduce the energy consumption of propylene separation technology and will provide support for the localization of ultra-high purity electronic chemicals, Xing said.
The study was recently published in the journal Science.

Well-preserved crystallized dinosaur egg fossils discovered in central China
 (Xinhua) 16:41, December 22, 2023
WUHAN, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- Three crystallized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in central China's Hubei Province, offering evidence for the study of dinosaur egg-laying processes and the paleoenvironment, according to a local nature reserve.
These crystallized dinosaur egg fossils were found in a nest containing 31 dinosaur egg fossils at Qinglong Mountain in Shiyan City during the process of restoration and management of a dinosaur egg fossil outcrop.
The three egg fossils are all well-preserved with the eggshells and internal crystalline mineral intact, said Zhao Bi, a scholar with the Hubei Institute of Geosciences, adding the three egg fossils are believed to be uncracked and unhatched eggs.
Researchers have found that the internal crystalline mineral type of these crystallized egg fossils is calcite with a particle size of 0.2-0.4 cm.
Compared with regular fossilized dinosaur eggs, crystallized dinosaur egg fossils are rare in the world due to the harsh environmental conditions required for their formation. This is the first time crystallized dinosaur egg fossils have been found in Hubei Province.
The three egg fossils remained intact despite subsequent burial and diagenesis, and the internal crystalline minerals formed during the burial and diagenesis of the eggs when a large volume of supersaturated calcium carbonate solution infiltrated the eggshell pores, crystallizing and filling the eggs, according to Zhao.
Dinosaur egg fossil clusters, dating back to the middle Cretaceous period about 60 to 80 million years ago, were first discovered at Qinglong Mountain in 1995. To date, researchers have found nearly 3,000 surface-exposed or well-preserved egg fossils at the site.

Chinese scientists develop knittable fiber inspired by polar bear fur
 (Xinhua) 13:31, December 22, 2023
HANGZHOU, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists has developed a knittable fiber with exceptional thermal insulation drawing inspiration from polar bear fur.
According to a study published on Friday in the journal Science, this encapsulated aerogel fiber is washable, dyeable, durable and well-suited for use in advanced textiles.
Aerogel fibers typically lack the strength and stretchability required for weaving into cloths, and they lose their insulating properties in wet or humid conditions.
The researchers from Zhejiang University discovered inspiration in the specialized fur of polar bears, which effectively keeps them warm and dry. The hair features a porous core enclosed within a dense shell structure, according to the study.
Mimicking the bear's core-shell structure, the researchers created a strong aerogel fiber with lamellar pores, which effectively traps the infrared radiation close to the skin and maintains mechanical robustness, making it suitable for knitting or weaving.
The fiber maintained its thermal insulation properties with minimal impact even after 10,000 repeated stretching cycles at 100 percent strain, according to the study.
The team of researchers tested the fiber in a thin sweater, which, despite being roughly one-fifth as thick as a down jacket, delivered thermal insulating performance comparable to the latter.
This clothing design provides rich possibilities for developing multifunctional aerogel fibers and textiles in the future, according to the researchers.

BEIJING, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhou-17 crew members on board China's orbiting space station completed their first spacewalk at 9:35 p.m. (Beijing Time) on Thursday, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin worked seven-and-a-half hours to complete set tasks such as a Tianhe core module solar wing repair test, with the assistance of a ground team and the space station's robotic arm.
Tang Hongbo and Tang Shengjie have since returned safely to the Wentian lab module.
It was the second time that Tang Hongbo, China's first space traveler to return to the space station for a second mission, has performed a spacewalk. Tang Shengjie became the country's youngest astronaut to carry out an extravehicular mission.
In the future, the Shenzhou-17 crew will complete a significant number of planned space science experiments, technical tests, spacewalks and the installation of extravehicular payloads.
They have performed many tasks since they entered the orbital complex on Oct. 26, including a crew rotation with Shenzhou-16 astronauts, space station platform maintenance, life and health support, extravehicular spacesuit inspections and tests, and Tianzhou-6 cargo ship equipment inspections.
They have also undertaken robotic arm operations training, emergency life-saving drills, medical rescue drills, and full-system pressure emergency drills.

China welcomes researchers from the United States wishing to study lunar samples brought back by a Chinese robotic probe, but urges ""farsighted people in the US"" to work for the abolition of the infamous Wolf Amendment, said a spokesman for the China National Space Administration.
In an exclusive interview with China Daily on Thursday in Beijing, Xu Hongliang, the spokesman, said: ""China has never made any law, regulation or clause that prohibits cooperation with the US on space exploration. We place great attention on international space cooperation and we are always open to exchanges and communication with the US in this regard.""
Xu said that China ""welcomes people of the international science community, including those from the US, who have applied, or intend to apply"", for the use of its lunar samples in accordance with its application rules and ""through appropriate means"".
He emphasized that the Chinese government carries out space programs to explore and develop outer space in a peaceful manner, and engages in international communication and cooperation based on principles of equal treatment, mutual benefit, peaceful purposes and shared development.
Till now, China has established communication and cooperation on space programs with more than 50 nations and international organizations, he said.
The Wolf Amendment, which was first added to NASA's annual appropriations bill by former US representative Frank Wolf in 2011, has been included in the agency's funding bill every year and has greatly affected bilateral ties between NASA and Chinese space authorities.
Xu said it is truly confusing why at a time when the US is seeking to apply for China's lunar samples, ""some people on the US side continue to show their fervid fondness for the Wolf Amendment"".
""I don't know whether the US side is playing on words or (playing) other little tricks,"" he said. The amendment has severed almost all exchanges and lines of communication between Chinese and US space communities since 2011, he added.
In 2015, the US proposed to China to jointly run a Civil Space Dialogue, which China agreed to. The first dialogue was held in Beijing in 2015, the second in Washington in 2016, and the third again in Beijing in 2017. The fourth dialogue, which the US was supposed to host in 2018, is long overdue, Xu said.
China has done a lot of work to make the fourth dialogue happen, but all its efforts have been in vain, he said. ""This clearly shows that China is a genuine supporter of bilateral space exchanges and communication, and the reason why bilateral cooperation can't occur lies in the plain fact that the US government continues to adopt Cold War mentality in handling space issues between the two countries.""
Xu said that many of his ""peers in the international space circle"" have called on the US to relax or repeal the amendment, because they deem it as a stumbling block and only a tool for political propaganda.
""We also urge far-sighted people in the US to consider kicking away such an obstacle,"" he said, adding that as far as he knows, there have been strong appeals in the US for abolishing the Wolf Amendment and resuming cooperation with China in lunar and deep-space explorations.
The spokesman made the remarks in the wake of recent statements issued by NASA and US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.
In a Nov 29 statement, NASA said it has certified its intent to the US Congress to ""allow NASA-funded researchers to apply to the China National Space Administration for access to lunar samples returned to Earth on the Chang'e 5 mission"".
The US space agency said that applying for the Chang'e 5 samples will ensure that US researchers have the same research opportunities as scientists around the world.
However, NASA made it clear that this allowance applies specifically to Chang'e 5 mission samples and ""the normal prohibition on bilateral activity with (the) PRC (People's Republic of China) on NASA-funded projects remains in place.""
Meanwhile, when attending a lecture hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank in Washington, on Dec 12, Burns responded to a request for his perspective on China-US space collaboration by saying that he does not believe ""the Chinese have shown much of an interest in working with the US"" in space.
Yang Yuguang, a senior space industry observer and vice-chair of the International Astronautical Federation's Space Transportation Committee, said there are many distinguished figures in the US space community such as Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission, who have been calling for the rescission of the Wolf Amendment.
""Some people in the US are always terrified by their own imagination that China wants to contest for space supremacy with the US, but the fact is that we never want to engage in a space race,"" Yang said.
""When the US wishes to cooperate with us, it says such cooperation poses no threat to its national security, but when it doesn't want to work with us, bilateral ties become 'toxic and dangerous' to its national security. This is unfair,"" he said.
As of press time on Thursday, an email sent to NASA by China Daily, requesting a comment on the matter, had not been answered.
Professor Martin Sweeting, a fellow of the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and a distinguished professor of space engineering at the University of Surrey, said it is very good news that as an exception to the Wolf Amendment, the US Congress has granted permission to NASA-funded researchers to apply for access to Chang'e 5 lunar samples.
""International collaboration on scientific space exploration is of great mutual benefit and increases the contribution to global knowledge,"" he wrote in an email to China Daily on Thursday. ""This very welcome decision hopefully paves the way for further possible bilateral scientific collaboration (between China and the US) relating to the moon and on the future analysis of samples collected from Mars.""
Professor Clive Neal, a leading expert on the moon at the University of Notre Dame in the US state of Indiana, told the academic portal Science this month that US researchers started lobbying NASA officials to explore the possibility of gaining access to the samples soon after the Chang'e 5 capsule returned to Earth.
He said the Chang'e 5 lunar samples have proved to be much younger, dated at 2 billion years old, making them unique among lunar materials returned to Earth.
As one of the world's most notable space activities in 2020, the Chang'e 5 robotic mission was launched in November that year. It was China's first lunar sample-return mission and one of its most sophisticated and challenging space endeavors.
The landmark mission returned 1,731 grams of rocks and soil to Earth on Dec 17, 2020, presenting the first lunar substances obtained since the Apollo era. Recognizing the accomplishment, the International Academy of Astronautics gave its highest team award for 2023 to the Chang'e 5 project group, explaining that the Chinese team made outstanding contributions to mankind's lunar and deep-space exploration missions.
So far, lunar samples from the Chang'e 5 mission have enabled Chinese researchers to make a number of academic strides, including the discovery of the sixth new lunar mineral, named Changesite-(Y).
Changesite-(Y), which falls in the category of lunar merrillite, has become the first lunar mineral discovered and identified by Chinese scientists, making China the third nation in the world, after the US and Russia, to have achieved such a feat.

Vessel expected to meet demand in sightseeing tours, cargo transport
The multipurpose AS700 civilian airship model recently received a major certification from the government, moving it closer to mass production, according to State-owned conglomerate Aviation Industry Corp of China, the nation's leading aircraft maker.
The company said in a statement on Tuesday that the Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the type certificate to the AS700 on Dec 13, making the type the first manned airship in China to be domestically developed and certified.
Designed and built by the Special Aircraft Research Institute, an AVIC subsidiary in Jingmen, Hubei province, the airship's research and development started in August 2018, with the main aim of meeting tourist demand for sightseeing air tours.
Propelled by piston engines, the airship has a maximum takeoff weight of 4.15 metric tons and a maximum speed of 100 kilometers per hour. The craft is able to carry one pilot and nine tourists and is capable of flying 700 kilometers and staying in the air for up to 10 hours.
""After receiving the type certificate, we will cooperate with the airship's first users to develop a set of standard procedures for its business operations. And we will also work together to get the production certificate as soon as possible,"" Zhao Xiajun, deputy director of the institute, said on Wednesday.
""So far, we have signed several contracts for the first mass-produced AS700s,"" he said.
There are three prototypes: the first was built as an unmanned platform for technology demonstration and had completed all of its assigned test flights, the second and third are crewed and tasked with making test flights for certification procedures, said Du Wei, a senior engineer at the Jingmen institute and project manager of the AS700.
There will be plenty of space inside the aircraft, which will allow it to have cooking facilities and a washroom. It can also be equipped with high-end appliances or be modified into a luxury vehicle to meet various kinds of market needs, according to designers.
With a comfortable flight experience, good economy and high safety, airships are a good choice for aerial tourism and cargo transportation to remote areas, Du said.
""Besides its potential in tourism, the AS700 will also be suitable for a wide range of civilian operations such as mineral prospecting, marine surveillance, police patrols, cargo transport and emergency rescue,"" the manager said.

Technology aids productivity amid cold-wave conditions
 (Xinhua) 13:20, December 21, 2023
CHANGCHUN, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- In China's northeastern city of Changchun, where winter temperatures plummet to nearly minus 20 degrees Celsius, Wang Xinbing, a member of the local branch of State Grid, once faced challenges due to the harsh weather.
However, thanks to the assistance of intelligent inspection robots, he can now monitor substation equipment comfortably indoors.
""The robots can swiftly evaluate equipment conditions, significantly boosting our work efficiency,"" Wang said as he reviewed data and images transmitted by the robot from a 220 kV substation 30 km away.
""The robots are equipped with 40 high-definition cameras on their pan-tilt heads,"" Wang added.
These cutting-edge technologies are becoming more prevalent across China, helping with snow removal, ice melting, power restoration, and addressing the challenges brought about by intense rain and snowfall during the winter.
Drones also lend a helping hand during rapid inspections in the rugged terrain of the Dabie Mountains.
During the recent cold spell, Yuexi County in the city of Anqing, east China's Anhui Province, located in the hinterland of the mountainous region, has experienced significant snowfall. The potential increase in ice on power lines poses a threat to the entire county's electricity supply.
""The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can operate at high altitudes, at high speeds, and cover long distances,"" said Chu Zhugang with State Grid's Anqing branch.
""With predefined flight routes, they can complete an inspection within an hour,"" Chu said.
In freezing conditions, technology also plays a crucial role in maintaining the orderly functioning of both production and daily life.
In northeast China's Jilin Province, snow removal has become highly mechanized. Benefiting from the use of de-icing vehicles, snow blowers and biogenic snow-melting agents, manual labor serves as a supplementary measure.
In Pingshuo East Open-pit Mine, one of China's largest open-pit mines in the coal-rich Shanxi Province, the massive screen at the mine's control center shows live updates of orderly blasting, mining and transportation activities in a pit over 200 meters deep, despite the extreme cold temperatures following heavy snowfall.
The seamless operation relies on the assistance of unmanned trucks, which were introduced in 2022, said Dong Shubin, deputy chief of the mine.
""We have achieved the coordinated operation of five unmanned trucks. Previously, it required around 20 personnel to operate these trucks each day. Now, only a few safety officers are needed, monitoring screens from the control room, just in case,"" said Dong.
Dong added that the mine aims to achieve unmanned operations with about 100 trucks, each with a loading capacity exceeding 300 tonnes.
In many intelligent mines across China, the remote control of equipment such as electric shovels and drilling rigs is also being enhanced, aiding the country's mining industry in boosting production efficiency and mitigating the impact of extreme weather conditions.
