HANGZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese paleontological research team has identified a new species of tyrannosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 72 to 66 million years ago.
Researchers from the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History named the dinosaur ""Asiatyrannus xui"" in honor of Xu Xing, a Chinese scientist dedicated to dinosaur research.
The fossil specimen includes a nearly complete skull, along with tail vertebrae and hind limb bones, marking the first deep-snouted tyrannosaur discovered in southeastern China, according to Zheng Wenjie, a researcher from the museum.
Histological analysis revealed that the holotype of Asiatyrannus xui was not a fully mature adult but had passed through its most rapid growth stages.
Zheng added that the skull measures 47.5 centimeters in length, and the body length was approximately half that of Qianzhousaurus, which is estimated to reach around nine meters at similar growth stages.
The earliest tyrannosaurs appeared in the Middle Jurassic, around 165 million years ago. They became the apex predators in their respective ecologies during the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous in Asia and North America.
The findings were recently published online in the journal Scientific Reports.

China sees rapid development of intelligent shipping,2024-07-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0726/c90000-20198732.html,"Home>>
		
China sees rapid development of intelligent shipping
By Han Xin (People's Daily) 17:05, July 26, 2024
On the shore of the Bohai Sea, a ""smart zero-carbon"" terminal at the Section C of Tianjin Port's Beijiang Area was bustling with activity. Nearly 100 AI-enabled transport robots zipped back and forth, guided by the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, setting new highs in cargo handling volume.
A 12.5-meter-deep channel downstream of Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu province along the Yangtze River, was teeming with vessels. Thanks to an automatic identification system, ships entering an electronic geofence could quickly receive real-time service information, which significantly improved navigation safety.

In the waters off Zhanjiang, south China's Guangdong province, the unmanned vessel Wenjiang traveled thousands of miles from inland rivers to the open sea for marine surveying tests and applications. Equipped with low-latency communication and high-precision positioning systems, it not only navigated autonomously but also transmitted data in real-time, expanding the potential uses for unmanned vessels.
From fully automated cargo terminals to the rapid rise of digitally managed waterways and self-navigating smart ships, ""intelligence"" is becoming a key feature of the high-quality development of China's shipping industry.
Smart ports are emerging rapidly across China. Nowadays, China ranks among the world leaders in both operational and under-construction automated container terminals. The country has mastered key technologies across the entire chain, from design and construction to equipment manufacturing, system integration, and operational management. Both the overall application scale and technological level are at the forefront internationally.
Meanwhile, the automation of dry bulk cargo terminals is accelerating. Qinhuangdao Port, Huanghua Port, Qingdao Port, Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, and Zhangjiagang Port have achieved full automation of dry bulk cargo handling, transitioning towards unmanned, intelligent operations.
Smart waterways continue to expand. Electronic navigational charts now cover over 5,700 kilometers of waterways nationwide, with complete coverage of the Yangtze River's main channel. The application of electronic cargo release platforms for imported containers and bulk commodities by sea is also growing.

Significant breakthroughs have been made in the development of intelligent vessels. China has successfully developed key technologies for intelligent navigation, including ship perception and decision-making, with some indicators leading globally.
These advancements have resulted in a series of achievements, including the Zhifei vessel which equipped with a complete set of intelligent navigation systems, over 10 self-navigating ships, and more than 1,000 vessels applying intelligent technologies. These developments have brought substantial economic and social benefits.
""Currently, a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is reshaping the global shipping industry, creating new driving forces and competitive advantages,"" said an official with China's Ministry of Transport.
It is important to maintain a coordinated approach to promote systemic upgrades, and accelerate comprehensive development in smart ports, intelligent waterways, smart ships, and intelligent shipping services, so as to continuously enhance the digital and intelligent capabilities across all elements and the entire chain of the shipping industry, the official explained.
The shipping industry not only serves as a crucial support for economic circulation but also acts as a window into economic performance. The rapid development of intelligent shipping not only demonstrates China's growing strength in the shipping sector but also reflects the vibrant energy of a nation in motion.

Since this year, many Chinese ports have seen continued growth in throughput. From January to June, Ningbo-Zhoushan Port handled 708 million tons of cargo, a 4.2 percent year-on-year increase, and processed over 19.16 million twenty-foot equivalent units of containers, up 8.4 percent from a year ago.
During the same period, Huanghua Port, the primary hub for China's ""west-to-east coal transport and north-to-south coal transport"" strategy, achieved a cargo throughput of 179 million tons, marking a 12.04 percent year-on-year increase.
""Last year, China's international maritime shipping volume approached nearly 1/3 of global sea freight, further cementing the country's role as an 'anchor' in international shipping,"" said the official.
According to the official, since the beginning of this year, waterway transportation has continued to develop at a relatively rapid pace. The Three Gorges hub on the Yangtze River, the Changzhou hub on the Xijiang River, and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal have all set new records for vessel passages. The capacity and efficiency in transporting key materials and international containers have further improved.
At the same time, a number of major projects have accelerated. A container terminal project in the northern operations area of Xiaoyangshan port area in Shanghai has begun construction both on land and at sea, and work has commenced along the entire route of the Pinglu Canal project. Such growth in both volume and quality of the shipping industry will provide robust support for economic and social development.

Chinese scientists research on protecting, restoring high-altitude wetlands
 (Xinhua) 14:57, July 26, 2024
CHENGDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are conducting monitoring, evaluation and research on biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration of the alpine wetlands in southwest China, harnessing the significant role of the wetlands in carbon sequestration and climate change adaptation.
The Zoige Wetland Ecology Research Station, established by the Chengdu Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Sichuan Province, went operational on Friday.
The station is expected to provide scientific and technical support and policy recommendations for regional ecological protection and sustainable socio-economic development in southwest China, and also make scientific explorations for global wetland protection, according to Gao Yongheng, head of the research station.
The Zoige plateau, one of the main distribution areas of high-altitude wetlands in China, serves as an important ecological barrier. With the backdrop of global climate change, the region is facing significant ecological challenges, including biodiversity loss and a weakened wetland ecosystem, scientists say.
China lacked long-term monitoring and research on the ecology of high-altitude wetlands. The systematic scientific research, technological development and promotion of sustainable agricultural and pastoral development in the Zoige region are still weak, said Zhu Dan, deputy director of the station, who has conducted research in the Zoige region for nearly two decades.
The Zoige region is the most populous area for yaks on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, and the yaks are a vital source of energy and materials for the local herdsmen, Zhu said.
In addition, the Zoige wetland is the world's most concentrated area of alpine peatlands, which are similar to huge loose sponges able to hold water up to eight times its own weight. During the dry season of the Yellow River, the Zoige wetland could provide 40 percent of the downstream flow, according to Zhu.
""If the Zoige wetland is not properly protected, it might become a source of sandstorms in south China, posing a threat of ecological degradation,"" Zhu said.
Peatlands play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, carbon fixation and climate change mitigation due to the slow decomposition rate of carbon dioxide in peat soils, Zhu explained.
Zhang Hui, an assistant researcher at the station, said peatlands, often in a state of being submerged or semi-submerged, contain a large volume of water but with little air and low soil fauna content. If peatlands degrade, there would be an increase in soil animals such as earthworms, as well as microorganisms, leading to peat decomposition and causing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, thereby exacerbating global warming trends.
""Our research has illustrated that the unique climatic conditions of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, with its low temperatures, inhibit carbon decomposition, thereby possessing a strong carbon neutralization function,"" said Ju Peijun, who is also conducting research in the Zoige region.
""Previously, people only focused on the ecological functions of wetlands in terms of water conservation and biodiversity protection. We hope to draw people's attention to the carbon fixation function of wetlands,"" said Liu Xinwei, another assistant researcher at the station.
The new station, focusing on the Zoige wetland and covering typical wetland distribution areas of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and the adjacent regions, adopts an interdisciplinary approach to mainly carry out monitoring, research and experimental demonstration works on the conservation and sustainable utilization of high-altitude wetland ecosystems.
The research mainly includes observation of wetland and grassland ecological elements, high-altitude ecosystem structure, function and processes, as well as wetland and grassland resource conservation and utilization.
The research station has set up field observation instruments and equipment at altitudes ranging from 3,400 meters to 4,100 meters, and utilizes efficient storage and automated information transmission methods to improve the accuracy and density of field data monitoring, as well as the comprehensiveness of observed parameters.
The researchers also established a climate change simulation platform to investigate the mechanisms of aboveground vegetation, underground soil microorganism and soil carbon processes in alpine wetlands in response to climate change.
Scientists will also comprehensively explore the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as investigate grassland degradation and restoration in high-altitude wetlands. Their experiments involve studying the impacts of environmental change such as warming, nitrogen deposition and grassland degradation.
Chinese researchers have engaged in exchanges and cooperation on wetland ecological protection with scientists from the United States, Canada, Australia and Croatia, as well as neighboring countries such as Russia, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bhutan and Afghanistan.

To unlock door of history with key of technology
By Feng Tianyu (People's Daily) 14:25, July 26, 2024
A world-class archaeological project has made new progress. Recently, China's National Cultural Heritage Administration announced the latest archaeological findings from the Northwest Continental Slope No. 1 and No. 2 Shipwreck sites in the South China Sea.
Underwater archaeology and cutting-edge technology have teamed up to crack open a ""time capsule"" that's been lying on the seabed for centuries, more than a kilometer below the sea surface.

These long-lost treasures are finally seeing the light of day, stunning the world with their beauty. Each artifact tells its own tale of history while showcasing just how far technology has come.
""Retrieving"" history from the vast, deep sea is no easy feat. In the past, when deep-diving technology was not this developed, China's underwater archaeology was mostly confined to coastal and shallow waters. Deep-sea archaeology seemed like an impossible mission.
But in August 2017, China's second manned deep-sea submersible, Deepsea Warrior, successfully completed its first manned dive, marking the beginning of China's deep-sea archaeology efforts.
The submersible played a crucial role in the recent archaeological survey of the Northwest Continental Slope No. 1 and No. 2 Shipwreck sites in the South China Sea. Its long baseline positioning system acted like a lighthouse, providing precise navigation. 3D laser scanners and high-definition cameras served as its ""eyes,"" keenly capturing every detail in the murky underwater environment. The newly upgraded flexible robotic arms could steadily extract artifacts while preventing any damage.
Thanks to these technological advancements, archaeology has ventured into the blue depths, allowing us to reach deeper and further into the underwater world and explore the deep-sea imprints of Chinese civilization.

Artifacts are the keys that unlock the memories of history. With the power of technology, more and more artifacts are being unveiled, revealing their mysterious stories.
From the Northwest Continental Slope No. 1 and No. 2 Shipwreck sites, pottery and porcelain pieces have been extracted. Some of them bear inscriptions such as ""Fu (fortune),"" ""Zheng (righteousness)"", ""Taiping (peace),"" and other information. These inscriptions not only serve as marks of their origin but also represent fragments of history. They reflect the daily lives of people from centuries ago and depicting the social landscape of that era. They narrate tales of joy and hardship, exploration and perseverance.
Each recovered artifact serves as crucial evidence. From the exported ceramics to the imported timber, and to the exotic Fahua pottery, the treasures found within the depths of the sea from the two sunken ships vividly depict the prosperous maritime trade during the mid-Ming Dynasty. They bear witness to the significant exchanges of trade and culture along the ancient Maritime Silk Road, showcasing the vibrant interactions between China and other nations.
Technology is expanding the boundaries of human cognition, enabling people to deepen their understanding of themselves through various means.
Carbon-14 dating has been utilized to establish a unified ""time scale"" for comparative research on different cultures, types, and archaeological sites, and ancient DNA studies were conducted to comprehensively comprehend the migration processes and social forms of ancient populations. Besides, organic residue analysis is used to understand the processing and utilization levels of organisms by our ancestors.

By harnessing technology effectively, archeologists can bring to light and revive the glory of those civilizations that have been buried by thick soil or submerged in seawater for thousands of years, allowing them to ""speak"" once again.
Technology is also breaking down barriers that once stood between ordinary viewers and the cultural relics. Virtual reality, augmented reality, holographic projection, artificial intelligence, and other technologies are increasingly being applied in the field of cultural heritage.
For example, the new building of the Sanxingdui Museum in southwest China's Sichuan province employs naked-eye 3D technology to recreate the archaeological site, allowing visitors to witness the moment when the relics were unearthed. The Grand Bao'en Temple Heritage Museum in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu province has developed a metaverse program, enabling visitors to explore the Grand Bao'en Temple back in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
Modern technology allows historical scenes to transcend time and space. Visitors can gain a more intuitive understanding of the value of cultural relics and experience the charm of culture and the profoundness of history. Only when cultural relics enter people's lives and hearts in a more dynamic way can their vitality be sustained.
Archaeology serves the purpose of decoding the past and also embarking on the journey towards the future. By using the key of technology to unlock the door of history, people will be able to better trace the origins of Chinese civilization and continuously expand the historical memory of human civilization.

""Retrieving"" history from the vast, deep sea is no easy feat. In the past, when deep-diving technology was not this developed, China's underwater archaeology was mostly confined to coastal and shallow waters. Deep-sea archaeology seemed like an impossible mission.
But in August 2017, China's second manned deep-sea submersible, Deepsea Warrior, successfully completed its first manned dive, marking the beginning of China's deep-sea archaeology efforts.
The submersible played a crucial role in the recent archaeological survey of the Northwest Continental Slope No. 1 and No. 2 Shipwreck sites in the South China Sea. Its long baseline positioning system acted like a lighthouse, providing precise navigation. 3D laser scanners and high-definition cameras served as its ""eyes,"" keenly capturing every detail in the murky underwater environment. The newly upgraded flexible robotic arms could steadily extract artifacts while preventing any damage.
Thanks to these technological advancements, archaeology has ventured into the blue depths, allowing us to reach deeper and further into the underwater world and explore the deep-sea imprints of Chinese civilization.

Artifacts are the keys that unlock the memories of history. With the power of technology, more and more artifacts are being unveiled, revealing their mysterious stories.
From the Northwest Continental Slope No. 1 and No. 2 Shipwreck sites, pottery and porcelain pieces have been extracted. Some of them bear inscriptions such as ""Fu (fortune),"" ""Zheng (righteousness)"", ""Taiping (peace),"" and other information. These inscriptions not only serve as marks of their origin but also represent fragments of history. They reflect the daily lives of people from centuries ago and depicting the social landscape of that era. They narrate tales of joy and hardship, exploration and perseverance.
Each recovered artifact serves as crucial evidence. From the exported ceramics to the imported timber, and to the exotic Fahua pottery, the treasures found within the depths of the sea from the two sunken ships vividly depict the prosperous maritime trade during the mid-Ming Dynasty. They bear witness to the significant exchanges of trade and culture along the ancient Maritime Silk Road, showcasing the vibrant interactions between China and other nations.
Technology is expanding the boundaries of human cognition, enabling people to deepen their understanding of themselves through various means.
Carbon-14 dating has been utilized to establish a unified ""time scale"" for comparative research on different cultures, types, and archaeological sites, and ancient DNA studies were conducted to comprehensively comprehend the migration processes and social forms of ancient populations. Besides, organic residue analysis is used to understand the processing and utilization levels of organisms by our ancestors.

By harnessing technology effectively, archeologists can bring to light and revive the glory of those civilizations that have been buried by thick soil or submerged in seawater for thousands of years, allowing them to ""speak"" once again.
Technology is also breaking down barriers that once stood between ordinary viewers and the cultural relics. Virtual reality, augmented reality, holographic projection, artificial intelligence, and other technologies are increasingly being applied in the field of cultural heritage.
For example, the new building of the Sanxingdui Museum in southwest China's Sichuan province employs naked-eye 3D technology to recreate the archaeological site, allowing visitors to witness the moment when the relics were unearthed. The Grand Bao'en Temple Heritage Museum in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu province has developed a metaverse program, enabling visitors to explore the Grand Bao'en Temple back in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
Modern technology allows historical scenes to transcend time and space. Visitors can gain a more intuitive understanding of the value of cultural relics and experience the charm of culture and the profoundness of history. Only when cultural relics enter people's lives and hearts in a more dynamic way can their vitality be sustained.
Archaeology serves the purpose of decoding the past and also embarking on the journey towards the future. By using the key of technology to unlock the door of history, people will be able to better trace the origins of Chinese civilization and continuously expand the historical memory of human civilization.

China's homegrown large UAVs rush to support flood-season rescue
 (Xinhua) 13:29, July 26, 2024
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's homegrown large civil unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are moving swiftly to support the fight against torrential rains, typhoons and other natural disasters in the critical flood season this summer.
The independently-developed large civil UAVs, including the Wing Loong-2H and Haiyan-1, have been dispatched to support disaster relief, disaster prevention and mitigation, and other emergency rescue missions, according to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).
The country has entered the annual critical flood season, which normally runs from late July to early August. Large UAVs are performing unique roles in serving disaster monitoring, meteorological monitoring, communication support, post-disaster recovery efforts and more.
The Wing Loong-2H large UAV flew for a total of 45 hours over three consecutive days, from July 20 to 22, over the flood-stricken Hanyuan County under the city of Ya'an, southwest China's Sichuan Province, said AVIC.
Responding to the task from the Ministry of Emergency Management, the Wing Loong-2H carried out comprehensive disaster monitoring over the affected areas. It supported searches for missing personnel and provided long-term and stable communications support, said AVIC.
This large UAV provided rescue-command authorities with real-time information in the form of high-definition images, voice and data from the disaster-hit areas, supporting them in confirming risk points, monitoring disaster conditions, as well as efficient and precise on-site command and rescuer dispatch, said the developer.
With its ability to remain in flight for long periods, the Wing Loong-2H also served as an airborne communication base to ensure communication services. It provided stable and continuous communication signals covering a total area of about 2,700 square km during missions over three days, and sent 42,000 rescue-related messages, serving as a lifeline for both people and rescue forces in disaster areas.
As a meteorological monitoring-specialized model, the Haiyan-1 large UAV is playing its part in the typhoon season this summer.
In responding to the task from the Meteorological Observation Center under the China Meteorological Administration, the Haiyan-1 flew into the interior of Typhoon Prapiroon, the fourth typhoon of the year, said AVIC.
It carried out typhoon detection work in cooperation with an aircraft sent by the Hong Kong Observatory. They precisely captured the outer cloud system structure of Typhoon Prapiroon, supporting meteorological disaster prevention and reduction efforts.
In this mission lasting about two hours, Haiyan-1 sent more than 4,200 valid items of data to a meteorological big-data cloud platform and provided them to meteorological authorities and related institutions for further study.
It also obtained data on the temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed and air pressure at different altitudes, allowing meteorological forecasters to clearly observe the three-dimensional structure of the typhoon.
The Haiyan-1 large UAV enabled the forecasters to clearly ""see"" the inner structure of the typhoon cloud system, helping them to grasp the typhoon's development and make forecasts in a more scientific manner, said AVIC.

China's advanced satellites for climate, carbon monitoring now operational
 (Xinhua) 10:46, July 26, 2024
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's atmospheric environment monitoring satellite and terrestrial ecosystem carbon monitoring satellite have been officially put into operation, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said on Thursday.
During their in-orbit testing, these satellites demonstrated favorable application results across multiple areas, including ecological environment, forestry and grassland, geographic surveying, meteorology, agriculture and emergency disaster response, according to an official of the CNSA.
The two satellites will provide crucial data to effectively address global climate change and support China's goals of achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality.
The atmospheric monitoring satellite is the world's first to utilize active laser detection, employing a combination of active laser, hyperspectral, multispectral and high-precision polarization techniques for comprehensive observation, according to the CNSA.
It is capable of conducting extensive, continuous, dynamic and round-the-clock comprehensive monitoring of atmospheric fine particulate matter, pollutants, greenhouse gases, clouds, aerosols, as well as environmental elements such as land surfaces and water bodies.
Additionally, it has for the first time achieved global round-the-clock high-precision detection of carbon dioxide column concentrations at 1 PPM.
The terrestrial ecosystem carbon monitoring satellite, also known as ""Goumang"" (named after the ancient Chinese god of spring, growth and life), is the world's first remote sensing satellite for forest carbon sinks combining both active and passive observation methods, the CNSA said.
It employs a range of remote sensing methods, including laser, multi-angle, multispectral, hyperspectral and polarization techniques, to detect vegetation biomass and productivity, and monitor atmospheric aerosol distribution.
It also meets the needs of geographic surveying, disaster assessment, and agricultural remote sensing.
""Goumang"" has achieved quantitative remote sensing detection of forest vegetation height, biomass, and chlorophyll fluorescence, enhancing the forest carbon sink monitoring capabilities of both China and the world.
The CNSA will further explore the satellite application scenarios, enhance the overall application effectiveness, and promote the sharing and utilization of satellite data resources.
China successfully launched the atmospheric environment monitoring satellite on April 16, 2022, and the terrestrial ecosystem carbon monitoring satellite on Aug. 4, 2022, both from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern Shanxi Province.

Following a significant finding by Chinese researchers that for the first time in human history hydrated mineral containing molecular water was found in lunar soil, Chinese netizens started heated discussions over the possibility of growing a variety of vegetables, fruits and flowers on the moon, with the hope of turning Earth's neighbor into another ""home garden.""
Experts said the newly discovered mineral provides great potential for planting seeds on the moon, but the finding seems only a ""step one"" for this ambitious dream. They also noted that this discovery not only makes a revolutionary contribution to understanding the evolution of the moon but could also greatly facilitate future manned lunar missions and the establishment of lunar research stations.
On Tuesday, researchers from the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), along with scholars from renowned Chinese universities, revealed they have discovered ULM-1, an unidentified mineral crystal from the lunar samples retrieved by Chang'e-5 mission, which is enriched with water molecules and ammonium, China Central Television (CCTV) reported.
This mineral has water molecules accounting for as much as 41 percent of the sample's mass, according to the report.
""A mineral that contains water molecules has never been found in previously returned lunar soil samples,"" Jin Shifeng, associate researcher at the Institute of Physics of CAS, said.
Prior research on samples collected by the US Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972 indicated no presence of hydrated minerals in lunar soil. The assumption that the moon lacked water then became a fundamental premise in lunar scientific research, which had a significant impact on understanding lunar volcanic evolution, lunar origin and other related issues.
Chen Xiaolong, another research fellow at the institute, said this result ""changed our understanding of whether lunar soil contains water and the form in which water exists.""
Chen was quoted in another CCTV report on Thursday as saying that through thermodynamic analysis calculations, we can estimate how much water and water vapor were present during lunar volcanic eruptions in the past, greatly deepening our understanding of the celestial body.
As soon as the good news broke out, Chinese netizens were thrilled to begin brainstorming for ways to explore the mysterious land. Those from the southern parts of China, known for their ""hot and spicy"" dishes, called for planting ""space-borne chili peppers,"" while others from the north asked if potatoes and green beans can be considered for the moon.
Responding to the eager calls and enthusiasm from the public, Chinese researchers explained that these hydrated minerals are rich in ammonia, which is a type of nitrogen fertilizer, similar to ammonium bicarbonate used on Earth. In addition, there is also small amount of potassium found in the mineral, which is a potassium fertilizer.
Therefore, this discovery provides great potential for humans to grow crops on the moon in the future, they said.
However, Zhang Chuanjun, a senior aerospace breeding engineer, told the Global Times that there remain many issues to consider. ""For instance, on Earth, in order to grow any plant, various conditions are required, with water being just one aspect. Other factors include fertilizers, light, temperature, humidity and air. Only when these conditions are met, can plants thrive,"" he said.
""On the moon, the water we found is not in liquid form but exists in a crystalline form. Therefore, it cannot be directly used for planting, so the next step would be research. We would research how to extract water from the crystals,"" Zhang noted. Additionally, due to the moon's gravity being only one sixth of Earth's, even if there is water and fertilizer, the ability to retain them and allow plants to absorb them is also a challenge.
In terms of human exploration of the moon, if in the future our taikonauts can extract water vapor or water from these crystals, it would solve a major issue in future manned lunar missions and the construction of lunar research stations, as we would no longer need to transport water from Earth. This would address a significant concern in manned lunar exploration, meanwhile saving substantial costs, Zhang said.
The discovery of hydrated mineral also revealed a possible form of water molecules on the moon - hydrated salt. Unlike volatile water ice, this hydrated material is highly stable in the high latitude regions of the moon. This implies that even in the vast sunlight-exposed areas of the moon, this stable hydrated salt may still exist.
This provides new possibilities for the future development and utilization of lunar resources.
In order to ensure the accuracy of the discovery, Chinese researchers have conducted chemical and chlorine isotope analyses. They found that the composition of the mineral significantly differed from Earth minerals but matched those found on the moon, ruling out Earth contamination or rocket exhaust as the source of this mineral, according to media reports.

China actively promotes international cooperation on cross-border flow of data,2024-07-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0726/c90000-20198354.html,"Home>>
		
China actively promotes international cooperation on cross-border flow of data
By Li Jiabao (People's Daily) 09:29, July 26, 2024
Data is a new type of production factor in the era of digital economy. As an important link of digital economy, the cross-border flow of data has evolved into a foundation for the exchange and sharing of global capital, information, technology, talent and goods.
Recently, China has made new progress in international cooperation on the cross-border flow of data. It signed with Germany a memorandum of understanding on cross-border data flow, and had exchanges with Singapore on relevant cooperation at the inaugural meeting of a bilateral digital policy dialogue mechanism.

Such collaboration marked a positive signal of China promoting international cooperation on the cross-border flow of data. In recent years, the country has been advocating safe and orderly cross-border flow of data, working with all relevant parties to build an open and win-win international cooperation in the data field.
Zhang Pengyang, a professor with the College of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Technology, said that China has enacted a series of laws to cement the legal foundation for the cross-border flow of data, including those on cybersecurity, data security and the protection of personal information.
Besides, the country has been constantly optimizing its business environment and standardizing the management of cross-border data flow, so as to better facilitate foreign enterprises, Zhang said, adding that this demonstrated China's resolution and confidence in opening up.
China also participates in the making of relevant international rules, Zhang noted. It has signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, and is working to align itself with the high-standard economic and trade rules of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement.
Furthermore, China and some other countries and regions have signed bilateral and multilateral agreements on cross-border data flow.
At the border between China and Laos, specialized data that ensure cross-border railway transport are transmitted via information networks, enabling end users to operate in their respective systems and thus guaranteeing the smooth operation of the China-Laos Railway.
Patient treatment data from a clinical data research platform at Beijing Friendship Hospital affiliated with Capital Medical University, are securely processed and transmitted halfway across the globe to the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, in a bid to support joint research efforts between Chinese and Dutch medical experts.
Today, foreign purchasers can browse and obtain relevant information about Chinese suppliers with only a few clicks on their mouse on Chinese e-commerce platforms.
Such cross-border flow of data will become even more active as China deepens its cooperation and exchanges with other countries in various fields.
At present, the cross-border flow of data has become a new driver for global growth. It is expected to contribute $11 trillion to global GDP by 2025, according to a McKinsey & Company report.

""The cross-border flow of data is crucial for supporting international trade activities, global scientific and technological cooperation, and the sharing of data resources worldwide. It calls for international cooperation and sharing to promote the safe and orderly cross-border flow of data,” Zhang said.
Zhang believes that China's proposals and actions to promote such international cooperation would help global trade transit from commodity trade to digital trade and open up more opportunities for international cooperation on science and technology, culture, education and more fields.
Besides, these proposals and actions would improve China's institutional opening up, further optimize the country's business environment, expand the value of data, fully release the potential of data factor, stimulate enterprises' passion for innovation, and finally promote regional and even global economic growth, Zhang added.
However, as data are extremely replicable and non-exclusive, the cross-border flow of data comes with a series of security problems, bringing challenges to data sovereignty, privacy protection and even national security.
According to statistics, as of May 2023, more than 70 countries and regions had formulated regulations on the cross-border flow of data, and more than 180 regional trade agreements newly added specific articles or terms related to digital trade, including the cross-border flow of data.
In September 2020, China proposed the Global Initiative on Data Security, calling on countries to foster an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for mutual benefit, win-win outcomes and common development.
Zhang said the Global Initiative on Data Security stresses that countries should respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and governance of data of other countries, and jointly safeguard the security and order of the global data flow. They should not only focus on their own data security, but also respect other countries' rules on cross-border data flow.

China actively promotes international cooperation on cross-border flow of data
By Li Jiabao (People's Daily) 09:29, July 26, 2024
Data is a new type of production factor in the era of digital economy. As an important link of digital economy, the cross-border flow of data has evolved into a foundation for the exchange and sharing of global capital, information, technology, talent and goods.
Recently, China has made new progress in international cooperation on the cross-border flow of data. It signed with Germany a memorandum of understanding on cross-border data flow, and had exchanges with Singapore on relevant cooperation at the inaugural meeting of a bilateral digital policy dialogue mechanism.

Such collaboration marked a positive signal of China promoting international cooperation on the cross-border flow of data. In recent years, the country has been advocating safe and orderly cross-border flow of data, working with all relevant parties to build an open and win-win international cooperation in the data field.
Zhang Pengyang, a professor with the College of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Technology, said that China has enacted a series of laws to cement the legal foundation for the cross-border flow of data, including those on cybersecurity, data security and the protection of personal information.
Besides, the country has been constantly optimizing its business environment and standardizing the management of cross-border data flow, so as to better facilitate foreign enterprises, Zhang said, adding that this demonstrated China's resolution and confidence in opening up.
China also participates in the making of relevant international rules, Zhang noted. It has signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, and is working to align itself with the high-standard economic and trade rules of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement.
Furthermore, China and some other countries and regions have signed bilateral and multilateral agreements on cross-border data flow.
At the border between China and Laos, specialized data that ensure cross-border railway transport are transmitted via information networks, enabling end users to operate in their respective systems and thus guaranteeing the smooth operation of the China-Laos Railway.
Patient treatment data from a clinical data research platform at Beijing Friendship Hospital affiliated with Capital Medical University, are securely processed and transmitted halfway across the globe to the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, in a bid to support joint research efforts between Chinese and Dutch medical experts.
Today, foreign purchasers can browse and obtain relevant information about Chinese suppliers with only a few clicks on their mouse on Chinese e-commerce platforms.
Such cross-border flow of data will become even more active as China deepens its cooperation and exchanges with other countries in various fields.
At present, the cross-border flow of data has become a new driver for global growth. It is expected to contribute $11 trillion to global GDP by 2025, according to a McKinsey & Company report.

""The cross-border flow of data is crucial for supporting international trade activities, global scientific and technological cooperation, and the sharing of data resources worldwide. It calls for international cooperation and sharing to promote the safe and orderly cross-border flow of data,” Zhang said.
Zhang believes that China's proposals and actions to promote such international cooperation would help global trade transit from commodity trade to digital trade and open up more opportunities for international cooperation on science and technology, culture, education and more fields.
Besides, these proposals and actions would improve China's institutional opening up, further optimize the country's business environment, expand the value of data, fully release the potential of data factor, stimulate enterprises' passion for innovation, and finally promote regional and even global economic growth, Zhang added.
However, as data are extremely replicable and non-exclusive, the cross-border flow of data comes with a series of security problems, bringing challenges to data sovereignty, privacy protection and even national security.
According to statistics, as of May 2023, more than 70 countries and regions had formulated regulations on the cross-border flow of data, and more than 180 regional trade agreements newly added specific articles or terms related to digital trade, including the cross-border flow of data.
In September 2020, China proposed the Global Initiative on Data Security, calling on countries to foster an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for mutual benefit, win-win outcomes and common development.
Zhang said the Global Initiative on Data Security stresses that countries should respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and governance of data of other countries, and jointly safeguard the security and order of the global data flow. They should not only focus on their own data security, but also respect other countries' rules on cross-border data flow.
This initiative demonstrates China's sense of responsibility in global digital governance, and will inject new vitality into building a fair, inclusive and efficient global digital governance system, Zhang added.

Chinese scientists discover highest-energy gamma-ray line in the universe,2024-07-26,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0726/c90000-20198209.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese scientists discover highest-energy gamma-ray line in the universe
By Leng Shumei (Global Times) 08:59, July 26, 2024
Chinese scientists from the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) reported on Thursday their discovery of a gamma-ray line with an energy of up to 37 million electron volts from an extremely bright gamma-ray burst. This represents the highest energy spectral line feature ever emitted by celestial objects in the universe, according to information from the IHEP shared with the Global Times.
The scientists also found that the gamma-ray line evolves according to a power-law function over time, providing crucial clues to unraveling the mystery of the line.
Their paper was published as a cover story in Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy on Thursday.
""These findings provide new and important clues for unraveling the mysteries of gamma-ray bursts and relativistic jets, marking a milestone in the study of gamma-ray bursts,"" corresponding author of the paper Xiong Shaolin told the Global Times.
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosion phenomena in the universe, which can be produced by either the core collapse of a massive star or the collision of two compact stars, such as neutron stars and black holes.
The abovementioned discoveries of the Chinese scientists were made on the so-called brightest of all time GRB, named GRB 221009A, which belongs to the former category and arrived on Earth on October 9, 2022, and was observed by many telescopes all over the world, according to the IHEP.
Researchers from the IHEP of CAS, the Yunnan observatories of CAS, Hebei Normal University, and Guizhou Normal University have formed a collaboration team and executed a comprehensive analysis of the observation data from two space gamma-ray monitors named GECAM-C and Fermi/GBM. The CAS-funded GECAM-C provided an accurate measurement of the low-energy band spectrum of this GRB, while the Fermi/GBM covered the high-energy band where the gamma-ray line showed up.
In particular, this burst is so bright (too many gamma-ray photons in a short period of time) that the Fermi/GBM detector suffered data loss during the bright part of the burst, making reliable data analysis very difficult. GECAM-C did not experience such a problem thanks to its dedicated design of the instrument; thus, the GECAM-C data was used to correct the Fermi/GBM data, the IHEP noted.
After the very challenging analyses of the data issues, instrumental effects, and background modeling, the research group managed to derive the reliable spectra of the GRB and further identify a series of gamma-ray lines throughout the burst, including the surprising gamma-ray line with energy up to 37 million electron-volts detected during the bright part of the burst. Interestingly, they found that line energy varies as a power-law function of time, while the ratio of the line width to line energy remains almost constant. Such features provide solid proof of the reality and the GRB origin of these gamma-ray lines. These discoveries shed new and unique light on the physics of GRBs and their relativistic jets, according to the IHEP.

Chinese scientists embarked on an expedition on July 20 to investigate the water resources and ecological environment in the headwater regions of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers.
The expedition will carry out scientific investigations into river hydrology, water ecology, soil erosion, glaciers and permafrost in Qinghai.
Qinghai is home to the Sanjiangyuan area, which contains the headwaters of China's three major rivers: the Yangtze River, the longest in China; the Yellow River, the second-longest; and the Lancang River, which is known as the Mekong River after it flows out of China.
As important parts of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecosystem, the headwater regions of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers play a crucial role in safeguarding water resources, protecting biodiversity and ensuring ecological stability.

China sets green targets for data centers
 (Xinhua) 14:59, July 24, 2024
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China has unveiled an action plan on the green development of data centers, specifying a set of targets to accelerate the low-carbon transition of the sector.
By 2025, the average power usage effectiveness (PUE) of data centers, a metric for energy efficiency, will be lowered to less than 1.5, according to the plan jointly issued on Tuesday by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and two central bureaus.
The plan also aimed to increase the utilization rate of renewable energy in data centers by 10 percent annually.
As an important infrastructure for development of new quality productive forces, data centers are among the sectors where energy use grow rapidly in China. It is expected that data centers' power usage in the country will climb by 15 percent annually.
The action plan proposed that by the end of 2030, data centers across the country will see their average PUE, and energy and carbon efficiency per unit of computing power reach internationally advanced levels, with the utilization rate of renewable energy further improved.
To meet the aforementioned goals, China will improve the layout of data centers, tighten the energy and water efficiency requirements for new projects, facilitate the energy saving and carbon reduction transformation of existing projects and promote the application of energy-saving technologies and equipment, according to the plan.
Industrial data show that China's total computing power scale now ranks second in the world. By the end of 2023, the number of data center racks in use topped 8.1 million in the country.

BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of 5G base stations in China had risen to nearly 3.92 million by the end of June, data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology showed on Tuesday.
The figure represented a net increase of 540,000 5G base stations over the end of last year, and accounted for 33 percent of the total number of mobile base stations nationwide, according to the data.
The number of 5G mobile subscribers in the country increased by 105 million from the end of last year to reach 927 million as of the end of June this year.
The figure accounted for 52.4 percent of the total mobile subscribers in China's three major telecommunication enterprises and China Broadnet, which stood at nearly 1.78 billion by the end of June, the data showed.
The aforementioned three telecommunication operators are China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.
China has seen its 5G network and commercialization develop rapidly in recent years. The country's 5G network now covers every city and town in the country, as well as more than 90 percent of its villages, the ministry said earlier this month.
Since the issuance of China's first batch of 5G licenses for commercial use five years ago, 5G technology has been integrated into various sectors such as industry, power, mining, healthcare and education, with large-scale promotion and application.
China has also built 300 5G factories and launched over 13,000 projects for the application of ""5G plus industrial internet.""
The ministry said last month that 5G commercialization had directly spurred total economic output of approximately 5.6 trillion yuan (about 785 billion U.S. dollars) in China over the past five years.
It has said that China would continue to advance 5G development and expand 5G network coverage in places such as cultural and tourism sites, healthcare facilities, universities, transportation hubs and subway systems.

China has achieved another significant milestone in its development of the new-generation manned carrier rocket, with the successful completion of a long-duration high-altitude simulation test for the vehicle's third-stage liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen engine, the Global Times learned on Tuesday.
The test has verified the feasibility of the rocket engine working for long periods in space, laying a solid foundation for the smooth progress of the country's future lunar manned exploration program, industry insiders said.
The test was conducted on a newly constructed vertical high-altitude simulation test stand, the first of its kind in China and the longest-duration hydrogen-oxygen engine high-altitude simulation test stand internationally, the Global Times learned from the Sixth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).
The successful completion of this long-duration test suggests that the vehicle's engine achieved the milestone of a thousand-second level test capability, representing a substantial improvement in China's liquid rocket engine testing technology.
This development will significantly support the smooth progression of China's manned lunar exploration program, the Sixth Academy said in a statement.
The CASC previously disclosed that the new-generation manned carrier rocket is expected to possess the capability of sending payload of 27 tons to the Earth-lunar transfer orbit and that of 70 tons to near-Earth orbit.
The new powerful rocket is expected to be ready for its maiden flight by 2027, according to the CASC.
China's lunar exploration program has been advancing steadily with its ""circle of friends"" continuing to expand. A research institute in Hungary has recently become the latest partner to join the China and Russia co-led International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to build a permanent base on the moon around 2035.
The Hungarian Solar Physics Foundation had signed a memorandum of understanding on ILRS cooperation with China's Deep Space Exploration Laboratory, during which it expressed its intention to strengthen cooperation with China in the area of deep space exploration, according to the lab's official WeChat account on July 19.
The joining of this organization from Hungary - both an EU and NATO member - has brought the total number of ILRS partners to around 25, according to media reports.
The Hungarian Solar Physics Foundation holds significant influence in the fields of solar physics and heliophysics and has been engaging in extensive collaborations with numerous universities and research institutions, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Science and Technology of China.
It is worth noting that Turkey is reportedly the first NATO member state to apply to join the ILRS project at a national level.
According to a report by Russia's TASS news agency in April, Anatoly Petrukovich, director of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that Turkey has submitted an application to participate in the ILRS project led by China and Russia.

BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's AG600 large amphibious aircraft has entered the phase of certification flight tests, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) announced on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the Airworthiness Certification Center of the Aviation Administration of China issued the Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) to the first model of the AG600 large amphibious aircraft family, said the AVIC, China's leading aircraft manufacturer.
The move means that the configuration condition of this aircraft, its expected airworthiness and expected safety performance have met the TIA requirements. It also lays a solid foundation for the AG600 aircraft to complete the airworthiness certification, said the AVIC.
Prior to obtaining the TIA, four AG600 aircraft, meant for test-flight use, were sent to conduct the airworthiness compliance flight tests.

The AG600 large amphibious aircraft family is being developed as vital advanced aeronautical equipment to strengthen the country's emergency-rescue capabilities.
The AG600 series amphibious aircraft features a unique configuration consisting of an integrated aircraft-shaped upper body and a ship-bottom-shaped lower body.
According to the AVIC, this amphibious aircraft family is China's first independently-developed large-sized special purpose civil aircraft. It is tailored to meet the needs of forest firefighting, maritime rescue and other emergency rescue missions across the country.
Notably, it is being developed with a focus on amphibious capability, versatility across multiple models, and serialized development, the developer said.
AG600 series aircraft can be fitted with equipment and facilities to meet the diverse needs of users in fields such as marine environment monitoring, resource detection, and passenger and cargo transportation.
The AG600 tech-demonstrator successfully completed its maiden flight in 2017, the first take-off from a reservoir in 2018, and the maiden flight over the sea in 2020.
The development of this type of large amphibious aircraft family is of great significance to enhancing the capability and level of China's homegrown civil aeronautical products, as well as promoting the leapfrog development of China's emergency-rescue aeronautical equipment system, said the AVIC.
