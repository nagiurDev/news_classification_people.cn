Global experts obtain maturity index of Chang'e-5 lunar soil
 (Xinhua) 16:20, December 12, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Global experts have measured the maturity index of the lunar soil brought back by the Chang'e-5 mission by magnetic techniques for the first time after the return of samples, shedding light on the space weathering processes occurring on the Moon's surface.
The lunar soil maturity is an index to characterize the space weathering degree of the soil. It is quantified by a variety of indices such as mean grain size, agglutinate abundance and solar wind gases abundances.
Studying the maturity index can reveal the interaction between micrometeorites, solar wind and lunar surface, and reflect the geological process of lunar soil formation.
The value of Is/FeO (the intensity of the characteristic ferromagnetic resonance normalized to total iron content) is regarded as the only golden standard of lunar soil maturity, according to the research paper published in the journal Icarus.
Researchers from the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Brown University and the University of Hawaii used magnetic techniques to measure the maturity index of Chang'e-5 lunar soil and found that its Is/FeO value is between 4 and 20, one of the lowest Is/FeO values obtained so far, indicating that it is among the most immature soils on the Moon.
""This indicates that the lunar soil in the sampling area of the Chang'e-5 mission was exposed to the space environment for the shortest time after formation,"" said Xiao Long, a professor at the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan.
According to him, based on current studies of Chang'e-5 samples, its landing and sampling unit is much younger than all Apollo and Luna units, which may be the reason why the Chang'e-5 lunar soil is the most immature.
The Chang'e-5 probe returned to Earth on Dec. 17, 2020, retrieving a total of 1,731 grams of lunar samples, mainly rocks and soil from the Moon's surface.

MEXICO CITY, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- In front of the headquarters of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), located in Texcoco in Central Mexico, tens of national flags flutter in the wind.
Wang Hui, a Chinese researcher from Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences (SAAS), was taking samples from a maize plant in the experimental greenhouse.
Wang is among the multiple visiting researchers from China, which established partnership in 1974 with CIMMYT, an international organization focusing on non-profit agricultural research and training.
As an expert in specialty maize, she has been engaged in research on maize genetic breeding for more than 10 years.
Last year, she came to Mexico, the birthplace of maize, as a visiting scholar on maize projects at CIMMYT for one year.
After collecting the samples, Wang entered the laboratory, where it is obligatory to wear a white uniform so as to guarantee the hygiene.
She then started to mix reagents with various maize samples, measuring their protein and trace elements. All the data will, in time, be processed on the computer to conduct further genetic and genomic analysis.
Using genome-wide association study, genomic selection and molecular marker-assisted selection, Wang combines biological breeding with conventional breeding techniques.
Working with researchers from all over the world, Wang contributes to the main purpose of this organization, which is to empower farmers through science and innovation and nourish the world amid a climate crisis.
Wearing an insulated coat, Wang walked into the germplasm bank where over 150,000 wheat germplasm and more than 28,000 maize germplasm are stored.
""China and CIMMYT have long-term collaboration on germplasm resources, which help to develop some important seeds worldwide,"" she said.
During her one-year research at CIMMYT, Wang has gained a better understanding of local culture and had good cross-cultural communication in the international organization.
""I have broadened my horizons since researchers at CIMMYT come from different countries and academic backgrounds,"" she said.
""The application of CIMMYT germplasm resources in specialty maize, advanced technological methods, and research achievements can benefit my future career,"" Wang added.
Wang is one of the over 5,000 Chinese scholars who have participated in the exchange program at CIMMYT.
""Talent exchange serves as a bridge to facilitate the cooperation between China and CIMMYT,"" Wang said. ""This will not only bring the world experience to China's agricultural development, but also give back to the world the Chinese approach to food security.""
In 2016, CIMMYT was honored with the International Scientific and Technological Cooperation Award by the Chinese government.
In 2018, the SAAS and CIMMYT jointly established the CIMMYT-China Specialty Maize Research Center (CCSMRC) in Shanghai, which aims to help Shanghai build a science and technology innovation center with global influence.
Later on, Wang will return to China and continue her research on specialty maize germplasm with all the experiences learned and an unforgettable memory living in Mexico.

Chinese plant scientists build vertical unmanned greenhouse rack,2023-12-12,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1212/c90000-20109099.html,"Home>>
		
Chinese plant scientists build vertical unmanned greenhouse rack
 (Xinhua) 15:05, December 12, 2023
CHENGDU, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Inside a building on the outskirts of Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan Province, 16 robots are programmed to tend vegetables grown on 20-tier vertically-installed rack.
Standing beside the 10-meter-high unmanned greenhouse rack, the tallest of its kind in the world, the urban farm's chief scientist Yang Qichang boasted that a total of 24,000 vegetables had been planted in a floorage of 200 square meters.
The plant factory was built at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences' Institute of Urban Agriculture (IUA). Its cultivation procedures are completely automated, including sowing, thinning, harvesting and packaging.
In an open field, the lettuce usually takes about 70 days to grow from seed to harvest, but in this urban farm, the growth period can be shortened to about 35 days, resulting in 10 crops a year. Its annual output is expected to reach 50 tonnes.
Nutrition has not suffered as a result of rapid growth and high productivity. The crude protein content of alfalfa grown by crop breeding accelerators has reached 30 percent, about 10 percentage points higher than that of normal species.
The alfalfa can be harvested once every 12 days. Crop yield has increased by more than 20 times when compared to nature's maximum of four harvests per year.
""Crops grow fast and well, and its key secret lies in the fill light,"" said IUA's researcher Wang Sen, pointing at LED light above the vegetables. ""We sought out an optimal 'light recipe' by adjusting the light source in different growth stages of the crops.""
Over the last three years, the plant scientists have created over 1,300 customized light formulas for 72 crops including rice, wheat, and corn.
IUA scientists managed to harvest high-quality grapes with high yields thanks to the root-limiting cultivation and precise control of water and fertilizers, in order to create and grow more fruits and vegetables in limited urban residential space.
Artificial planting racks are typically installed to five floors due to safety risks, but the robotic system in a smart factory works to overcome this limitation, according to Wang.
""In densely populated cities, plant factories can replenish the city's daily vegetable supply and improve its self-sufficiency,"" said Wang.
In addition, the vertical greenhouse technology can also be applied in scenarios such as border patrol, scientific expedition and island survival.
Next, scientists will upgrade the smart factory by integrating aquaculture and edible fungi cultivation into the vertical space, as well as investigate new models of rooftop and balcony agriculture.

Scientists develop new AI model for weather forecasting,2023-12-11,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1211/c90000-20108501.html,"Home>>
		
Scientists develop new AI model for weather forecasting
 (Xinhua) 14:29, December 11, 2023
SHANGHAI, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have developed a new model for sub-seasonal forecasts using artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
The new model, ""FuXi-Subseasonal,"" developed by scientists from the Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science, Fudan University, and China's National Climate Center, represents a significant advancement in AI climate modeling by extending the forecasting range to 42 days.
The new model was unveiled Friday at the China Pavilion during the ongoing 28th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, according to Fudan University.
According to scientists, sub-seasonal anomalies significantly contribute to high-impact climate events, so improving prediction skills at this timescale is a pressing requirement for advancing climate science.
The new model integrates the transformer architecture with guided random samples in a latent space to account for underlying uncertainty in sub-seasonal forecasts. By doing so, the model can generate forecasts with accuracy superior to those of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), said Qi Yuan, director of the Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science and a professor of Fudan University.
The new model has overcome challenges related to inaccurate initial conditions and inadequate external forcing signals at the sub-seasonal timescales and addressed notable gaps in forecasts, he said.
""This achievement addresses a long-standing technical challenge in climate change research. It offers the potential for more timely and accurate assessment of climate-related risks,"" Qi said.
Moreover, the new model has significantly advanced its ability to predict the atmospheric phenomenon of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), extending the prediction skill of MJO from 30 to 36 days.
""Accurate MJO prediction is important for agricultural planning, disaster preparedness and risk mitigation, and long-term climate research,"" Qi added.
The ""FuXi-Subseasonal,"" through its sub-seasonal forecasts of major weather processes like intense heat, severe cooling, and heavy precipitation, achieves a high level of precision unattainable by traditional technical methods, he said.
As the model advances with its cutting-edge AI capabilities, it is bound to make significant progress in addressing a broader spectrum of climate-related challenges, contributing to the empowerment of renewable energy development, construction of new types of electric power systems, ensuring agricultural food security, and achieving sustainable socio-economic transformation, Qi added.
The world needs to find more effective paths of technological innovation to address the increasingly severe global climate risks. AI holds tremendous potential in climate change risk management, said Wu Libo, a professor at Fudan University.
""With such high-end technology, we can better address the risks of climate change,"" Wu added.

China's largest onshore wind power base starts full-capacity production
 (Xinhua) 14:07, December 11, 2023
SHENZHEN, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- A wind power facility with an electricity generating capacity of more than 10 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year was put into full-capacity production and connected to the grid in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Sunday, and is the country's largest onshore wind power base currently in operation.
A project of China's leading nuclear power operator China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), the wind power plant built in Hinggan League, Inner Mongolia, is one of the country's first batch of large-scale wind and solar power bases planned for desert regions.
Electricity generated by the plant is environmentally friendly and equivalent to reducing standard coal consumption by about 2.96 million tonnes, and preventing the discharge of around 8.02 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the company headquartered in the city of Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province.
""With this wind power base, the installed capacity of CGN's new energy power generation facilities in operation in China is expected to reach 45 million kilowatts by the end of this year,"" said Zhang Zhiwu, chairman of the board of CGN New Energy Holdings Co. Ltd.

Biological community protects Great Wall's earthen sections from erosion
 (Xinhua) 13:24, December 11, 2023
BEIJING, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- New research has revealed that large portions of the Great Wall of China, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are protected by a biological community found on the surface of the ancient ramparts.
According to a study published on Saturday in the journal Science Advances, the biological soil crusts or biocrusts, consisting of photosynthetic bacteria, mosses and lichens, aid in increasing the ancient structures' stability and fend off erosion caused by rain and wind.
The Great Wall consists of many interconnected walls, some dating back 2,000 years. The existing sections have a total length of over 21,000 kilometers. Its most visible portions were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
Many sections of the wall, particularly those in more arid regions, were built with rammed earth, such as soil and gravel compacted into dense earthen formulations.
Some heritage conservationists have conjectured that the natural vegetation might accelerate the weathering process. However, the findings of the new study provided a contrary conclusion.
Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and China Agricultural University examined the structural stability and erodibility of samples taken from eight sections of the Ming-era Great Wall made from rammed earth.
They found that biocrusts covered 67 percent of the studied sections. Also, the cyanobacteria, a group of bacteria containing a blue photosynthetic pigment, dominated biocrusts in arid regions while Pottiaceae mosses thrived in wetter, semi-arid climates.
Overall, the biocrusts, especially those dominated by moss, enhanced the wall's mechanical strength and soil stability by 37 percent to 178 percent compared with bare rammed earth, said Xiao Bo, corresponding author of the study.
They also work to significantly buffer the effects of wind, rain and temperature fluctuations, according to the study. ""Biocrusts serve as stabilizers, sacrificial layers and drainage roofs, combining the protective functions of several conventional measures into one eco-friendly approach,"" Xiao said.

JIUQUAN, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- China on Saturday successfully launched the Zhuque-2 Y-3 carrier rocket into space from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.
The carrier rocket blasted off at 7:39 a.m. (Beijing Time) and sent three satellites -- Honghu, Honghu-2 and TY-33 -- into planned orbit.
It was the third flight mission of the Zhuque-2 carrier rocket.
The success of this launch mission has made Zhuque-2 China's first commercial liquid carrier rocket to be successfully launched in a row. In this mission, its technical maturity and stability were further verified, its reliability met the requirements of commercial launch delivery, and the rocket is closer to the phase of mass production and delivery.
The Zhuque-2 is China's first medium and large-size liquid rocket with liquid oxygen and methane as propellant. It is independently developed by LandSpace, and provides low-cost and highly reliable launch services to meet the commercial launch requirements in multiple scenarios.
Liquid oxygen-methane fuel is a type of rocket propellant formed by liquid oxygen and methane, the latter of which is the main component of natural gas.
The rocket has a height of 49.5 meters and a body diameter of 3.35 meters. Its takeoff weight is about 220 tonnes, and its takeoff thrust is about 268 tonnes.
Its carrying capacity is 1.5 tonnes for a 500-km sun synchronous orbit, and the following improved version can reach a carrying capacity of 4 tonnes for the same orbit, which can meet the needs of low-Earth orbit satellite deployment and the launch of transport spacecraft.
In Saturday's mission, the Zhuque-2 Y-3 rocket successfully sent three satellites into the sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 460 km.
The mission signifies that the rocket has carried out a commercial multi-satellite launch mission, and the developer of the rocket has made steady progress in its commercial operation of rockets. It also accumulated data and flight experience for the satellite's improvement and follow-up progress.
""Rockets are in the trend of large carrying capacity and low cost in the commercial space era. The key to the industrialization and commercialization of liquid rockets is to achieve low-cost, large-scale manufacturing and delivery, and continuous and stable launch,"" said Dai Zheng, deputy chief engineer and deputy chief commander of Zhuque-2.
LandSpace has cultivated a large-scale delivery capacity of rockets for commercial launch missions. It will continue to build commercial launch vehicles featuring high reliability, low cost and large capacity to sustain China's construction of a low-orbit satellite network, and support the development of low-cost cargo transport for the space station, according to Dai.

China used a Long March 2D carrier rocket on Sunday morning to send several remote-sensing satellites into space, marking the 500th launch of the Long March family.
The rocket blasted off at 9:58 am from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan province, spitting red-orange flames and soaring into bright skies, which was caught on video published by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, the maker of the Long March 2D series.
It was China's 59th rocket launch this year and the 13th flight of the Long March 2D model in 2023.
The overall success rate of the Long March fleet is around 97 percent. Of the 500 liftoffs, 297 were carried out by models developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology in Beijing and 203 by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology.
Both academies are subsidiaries of the state-owned conglomerate China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the nation's dominant space contractor.
The Long March 2D is one of the most reliable rockets in China. Since its debut flight in August 1992, the model has been used in 85 flights, all of which have been successful. This has led to it becoming well-known as the ""gold medal rocket model"" in China's space industry.
The 40.6-meter-tall rocket has a diameter of 3.35 meters and a liftoff weight of 251 metric tons. Its typical tasks are to transport satellites to low-Earth or sun-synchronous orbits.
The launch vehicle is capable of sending a 1.3-ton spacecraft into a sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 700 kilometers, or satellites with a combined weight of 4 tons into a low-Earth orbit.
In June, the 76th flight of the Long March 2D series sent a total of 41 satellites into space, setting a new national record for the largest number of spacecraft launched in a single mission.
China launched its first carrier rocket — a Long March 1 — in April 1970 to send its first satellite, Dongfanghong 1, or East Red 1, into space. The mission made China the fifth country capable of building and launching its own carrier rocket to reach Earth's orbit.
It took the Long March family 37 years to conduct its first 100 launches. The next 100 were made in seven-and-a-half years; the third 100 launches in over four years; the fourth 100 launches in two years and nine months; and the most recent 100 missions in only two years.
China has developed and launched more than 20 types of Long March rockets, and 16 of them are in active service.
Zhang Zhi, a senior rocket designer at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, said that engineers are working on the research and development of the country's next-generation crew-carrying rocket, and the new model, named Long March 10, is expected to be ready for its debut flight around 2027.
""The Long March 10 will be a brand new type of launch vehicle, and will be tasked with launching the country's new-generation manned spacecraft and the lunar landing module,"" he said.
In addition to the Long March family, there are multiple types of Chinese carrier rockets developed by another state-owned space contractor, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, and several private enterprises. So far, Chinese carrier rockets have conducted 564 launches.
The payloads in Sunday's mission — several satellites in the Yaogan 39 series — were manufactured by the Shanghai academy and the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing, which is also part of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.
Remote-sensing satellites refer to those tasked with observing, surveying and measuring objects on land or at sea as well as monitoring weather.
China has so far sent more than 300 civilian remote-sensing satellites into orbit. The Yaogan family is the largest fleet of remote-sensing spacecraft in the country, and their data has been widely used by governments, public service sectors and businesses.

BEIJING, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have discovered a key gene that regulates the loading of iron into maize kernels, providing a scientific basis for cultivating iron-enriched maize varieties and potentially helping to address iron deficiency anemia.
By utilizing the discovery, scientists can cultivate maize with the iron content in the kernels greatly increased to 70.5 mg per kg, which is more than twice the iron content in common maize varieties.
The study was conducted by a joint research team from the Institute of Crop Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Henan Agricultural University, and published online in the latest issue of the academic journal Science.
About one-third of the global population is affected by anemia caused by iron deficiency. Survey data shows that the prevalence of anemia among Chinese residents is 20.1 percent, with half of them suffering from iron deficient anemia, said Li Wenxue, a leading scientist on the research team.
""Although taking iron supplements could be a solution, the cost is relatively high,"" Li said. ""If the iron content of daily edible crops can be increased, it will help fundamentally improve the iron nutritional status of a large number of people at a low cost, which is particularly significant for developing countries that rely on maize as their staple food.""
However, the iron content in maize kernels is generally negatively correlated with yield, which greatly limits the cultivation of new maize varieties that are both high-yield and iron rich, he said.
The process of iron loading into maize kernels has always been an unresolved issue, so the new discovery is valuable in identifying genetic resources that could enhance iron concentrations in maize kernels without reducing yield, said Li.
The research team analyzed more than 200 maize data samples for the study. ""We conducted a genome-wide association study and identified a gene, ZmNAC78, that regulates iron concentrations in maize kernels,"" said Yan Pengshuai, the first author of the research article.
Furthermore, the researchers cultivated maize varieties with both high yields and high iron concentrations in their kernels by using a molecular marker. The results indicate that ZmNAC78 is a key gene for iron nutrition in maize and has no negative impact on yield, providing a feasible method for cultivating new high-yield maize varieties that are iron rich in the future.
The study also provides new insights into understanding the process of nutrient loading into cereal crops such as wheat, scientists say.

World's deepest underground lab expanded to help China detect dark matter
 (Xinhua) 09:43, December 09, 2023
* The world's deepest and largest underground physics laboratory went operational Thursday in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
* A laboratory that can shield cosmic rays and provide an experiment environment and facilities with an extremely low radiation background becomes a prerequisite for dark matter detection.
* After about three years of construction, the DURF welcomed its first batch of teams. As a major national project, the facility will develop into a world-class platform integrating multiple disciplines including particle physics, nuclear astrophysics and life sciences.
CHENGDU, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- The world's deepest and largest underground physics laboratory went operational Thursday in southwest China's Sichuan Province, as physicists moved in and started their research in the second phase of the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL).
The second phase project, or the Deep Underground and Ultra-low Radiation Background Facility for Frontier Physics Experiments (DURF), boasts the deepest, largest, ultra-clean underground space for scientific research. A total of 10 teams from universities and research institutions are stationed there and will seek to unveil the mysteries of the universe.
DARK MATTER DETECTION
In the vast universe, visible matter varying in size from a grain of dust to a planet like Earth or nebulae, only accounts for about 5 percent of the total mass of the universe. The remaining 95 percent consists of dark matter and dark energy.
The probability of dark matter interacting with visible matter is so low that it is very difficult to detect it directly, while ubiquitous cosmic rays can also greatly interfere with the efforts of physicists to detect dark matter.
Therefore, a laboratory that can shield cosmic rays and provide an experiment environment and facilities with an extremely low radiation background becomes a prerequisite for dark matter detection. The United States, Japan and some European countries have built underground laboratories meeting this requirement.
In 2009, Tsinghua University and the Yalong River Hydropower Development Company, Ltd. began to build the first phase of CJPL at a depth of 2,400 meters under the Jinping Mountain in Sichuan's Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture.

The first phase was completed and put into use at the end of 2010, featuring a room capacity of about 4,000 cubic meters. Thanks to rocks as thick as 2,400 meters, the laboratory is exposed to only a tiny flux of cosmic rays which is only a hundred-millionth of that found on the surface.
Two research teams, China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) group from Tsinghua University and PandaX group from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, were deployed in the first phase of CJPL. They now have a number of scientific achievements under their belts, elevating China's dark matter direct detection experiments to an advanced level on the global stage.
SECOND PHASE CONSTRUCTION
Given their growing list of achievements in the first phase of CJPL, it was felt that the research teams needed more space to carry out further studies. In 2014, Tsinghua University and the Yalong River Hydropower Development Company, Ltd. agreed on a plan to build a second phase to expand total room capacity at the facility to about 330,000 cubic meters.
To ensure the cleanest possible environment for the second phase of this project, builders had to meet the requirements of ultra-low cosmic ray flux, extremely low environmental radiation, extremely low radon concentration, and ultra-clean space.
For example, radon gas constantly released by surrounding rocks is a major source of interference in deep underground experiments. The construction team invented waterproof and radon suppression technology, and used special materials to lay a protective layer with a thickness of 10 centimeters on the surface of the cavern, thereby blocking 99 percent of the radon gas released by the surrounding rocks.

Background radiation of building materials and equipment were also taken into account. All materials and equipment must have a radiation background of less than three times that of the radioactivity level of rocks surrounding the cavern, and such materials and equipment could only be used after strict laboratory inspection.
Workers also laid about 10 km of ventilation pipes to supply fresh air with low radon content to the laboratory. For experiment spaces with special requirements, specially developed devices are provided to adsorb radon in the fresh air.
FURTHER EXPLORATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE
After about three years of construction, the DURF welcomed its first batch of teams. As a major national project, the facility will develop into a world-class platform integrating multiple disciplines including particle physics, nuclear astrophysics and life sciences.
The study of dark matter is a new starting point for human beings seeking a better understanding of the universe, and is currently among the hottest research topics in the fields of particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics, which means it is of great significance for frontier science research, according to scientists.
During the construction of the facility, various scientific research teams continued their exploration efforts.
The CDEX group innovated high-purity germanium detectors, upgrading the devices from the initial 1 kg to 10 kg, and is now planning to build a tonne-class detector.
Meanwhile, the liquid xenon detector of the PandaX group was upgraded from 120 kg to 4 tonnes. This group now plans to develop a 30-tonne or even 100-tonne dark matter detector, to boost their detection capabilities.

In 2022, by using the CJPL, the Jinping Underground Nuclear Astrophysics Experiment (JUNA) revealed the origin of the calcium found in the first stars. JUNA successfully verified the hypothesis that calcium comes from a key breakout reaction of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen cycle, confirming the origin of the calcium contained in these stars.
Reviewers of the journal Nature said that this study can be seen as a great experimental success, and that it provides new insight for future nuclear astrophysics studies.
""Whether we will find dark matter or not, every step we take is a step into the unknown, so every small step forward is a huge leap,"" said Liu Jianglai, chief scientist of the PandaX group. ""This is the fun of doing basic research.""

Researchers develop robotic mouse featuring enhanced flexibility, agility
 (Xinhua) 10:55, December 08, 2023
GUANGZHOU, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- An international team of researchers from Germany and China has developed a robotic robot with a flexible spine capable of performing lateral flexion, which displayed heightened agility compared to other existing four-legged robots.
The study about this 40-centimeter-long robot nicknamed NeRmo, which emulates the morphology and tendon system of a real mouse, was published on Thursday in the journal Science Robotics.
The researchers from the Technical University of Munich and Sun Yat-sen University designed this neurorobotic, mouse-inspired robot with artificial nylon tendons, which support compliant and smooth spine-like movement.
They built a rigid frontal structure that contains NeRmo's electronics, and a vertebrate spine on the back equipped with four lumbar and lateral joints. The artificial tendons in its knee and elbow joints allow the robot to move more like a mouse and turn quickly, according to the study.
The robot weighing 225 grams boasts 13 degrees of freedom, allowing for a variety of flexible movements, including rotating hips and shoulders, flexed knees and elbows, lateral and sagittal spine flexions, horizontal rotation and pitching of the head, and lateral curved tail.
This design significantly enhanced the robot's swerving capability. In a maze navigation task, the time it took to exit the maze was reduced by over 30 percent compared to when the spine controller was disabled.
""The flexible spine improves the locomotion performance of quadrupeds in static stability, walking speed, and turning behavior. Our study may advance the understanding of spine-based quadruped locomotion skills and highlight promising design concepts to develop more agile-legged robots,"" said Bing Zhenshan, corresponding author of the study.

Forest fires should be included in carbon emission accounting system: Chinese scientists,2023-12-08,http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1208/c90000-20107718.html,"Home>>
		
Forest fires should be included in carbon emission accounting system: Chinese scientists
By Leng Shumei and Fan Wei (Global Times) 10:08, December 08, 2023

Undated aerial photo provided by BC Wildfire Service shows wildfires in the coastal region of British Columbia, Canada. Canada is seeing its worst fire season on record as hundreds of blazes rage across the country, with more than 250 burning ""out of control,"" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. (BC Wildfire Service/Handout via Xinhua)
Chinese scientists urged the world to establish a comprehensive carbon accounting system that includes natural processes, especially extreme forest fires, as international delegates are gathering in Dubai to find a deal that will make a real difference in tackling the planet's climate issues at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), according to the Shenyang-based Institute of Applied Ecology (IAE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), on Thursday at a press conference on a blue paper on the carbon emissions of forest fires.
Led by the Institute of Applied Ecology, and jointly compiled by the Institute of Earth Environment and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the CAS, the document points out that, from 2001 to 2022, the annual average area of forest burned globally was 46.95 million hectares, which is 11 times the annual average increase in artificial forest area during the same period.
During this period, the total carbon dioxide emissions from global forest fires reached 33.9 billion tons, which could increase atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by 4.35 ppm (parts per million), the blue paper said.
Forest fires are a common disturbance in forest ecosystems, significantly affecting the composition, structure and succession characteristics of forests, thereby altering the material cycling and energy flow of forest ecosystems, said Xu Wenru, a researcher at the IAE and one of the lead authors of the blue paper.
Extreme forest fires have become more frequent in recent years, mainly due to climate change and human activities, leading to an increase in global carbon emissions, according to the blue paper.
""Our study has proven that the amount of emissions from forest fires is huge, so we think it is necessary to include forest fire carbon emissions into a carbon emission accounting system. On the other hand, once established, such a comprehensive accounting system will help urge related governments enhance prevention and management of extreme forest fires,"" Zhu Jiaojun, director of IAE, told the Global Times.
In terms of the impact of climate change and human activities on extreme forest fires, Zhu noted that these three elements are connected. He called for further scientific research and more international cooperation on fire carbon emissions.
Taking the extreme forest fires in Canada in 2023as an example, the blue paper points out that direct carbon dioxide emissions from this fire exceeded 1.5 billion tons, higher than the total carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires in Canada over the past 22 years (1.374 billion tons). ""This severely weakened the carbon sink function of forest ecosystems,"" Xu noted.
According to the blue paper, from May to August, the forest fires in Canada emitted a total of 10.02 million tons of PM2.5, causing environmental pollution not only in Canada but also significantly affecting air quality in large areas of the Northern Hemisphere.
The blue paper also presented significant spatial differences in global forest fire carbon dioxide emissions, with the carbon emissions from high-latitude coniferous forest areas in the Northern Hemisphere showing a rapid increasing trend. Between 2001 and 2022, Africa witnessed the largest areas that had been burned each year (33.32 million hectares), followed by Southern America (5.18 million hectares) and Asia (5.12 million hectares).
China's forest area accounts for 5.4 percent of the global total forest, but its carbon emissions from forest fires only account for 0.65 percent of the global total for forest fire emissions, significantly lower than the global average, the blue paper noted. From 2001 to 2022, China's carbon emissions from forest fires showed a significant downward trend, with annual average carbon dioxide emissions of 10 million tons.
China has adhered to the policy of ""prevention as the primary focus, combining prevention and control."" The country has also established an effective forest fire warning and monitoring system, and a comprehensive fire prevention network. Thanks to the efforts of the whole society, both the frequency and the burned area of forest fires have been declining since 2001, according to Xu.
