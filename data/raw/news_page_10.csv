NEW YORK, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- Boeing's Starliner spacecraft departed the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday to begin its journey back to Earth with no astronaut onboard.
The uncrewed spacecraft autonomously undocked from the ISS at approximately 6:04 p.m. Eastern Time Friday, to start its journey home, according to NASA livestream.
The separation burns and breakout turns for Starliner's departure went well, according to NASA engineers.
Starliner is headed for a deorbit burn at 11:17 p.m. Eastern Time. The spacecraft is scheduled to land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at approximately 12:03 a.m. Eastern Time Saturday to conclude the mission.
NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams closed the hatch on Starliner for the final time at 1:29 p.m. Thursday. The duo were on deck to monitor the spacecraft's departure as it undocked from the forward-facing port of the Harmony module, according to NASA.
Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Starliner spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed spaceflight, arriving at the ISS on June 6.
As Starliner approached the orbiting laboratory, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters.
The astronaut duo were originally scheduled to stay at the ISS for eight days. Now they have spent three months in space.
NASA ultimately decided that sending the two astronauts home onboard Starliner was too risky. The new plan is to have the two astronauts ride home in a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft in February 2025, and have Starliner return to Earth uncrewed.

China's planned lunar research station ushers in new era of global space collaboration
 (Xinhua) 09:13, September 07, 2024
* China's ambitious initiative to construct an international lunar research station (ILRS) is paving the way for a new era of global space collaboration, drawing in developing countries without their own space missions and igniting widespread enthusiasm for participation.
* The ILRS is a scientific experimental facility designed to be an expandable and maintainable system capable of long-term robotic operation with short-term human participation on the moon.
* The Chang'e-7 lunar exploration mission, scheduled for launch around 2026, will carry six international scientific instruments. Chang'e-8, targeting a launch around 2028, will offer 200 kilograms of international payload capacity.
HEFEI, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- China's ambitious initiative to construct an international lunar research station (ILRS) is paving the way for a new era of global space collaboration, drawing in developing countries without their own space missions and igniting widespread enthusiasm for participation.
In 2017, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) officially launched the ILRS cooperation initiative to the international community. To date, over 40 institutions from across the world have signed cooperation documents with China.

BEIJING, Sept. 6, 2024 (Xinhua) -- China National Space Administration and its counterpart in Senegal sign an agreement on International Lunar Research Station cooperation during the 2nd International Deep Space Exploration Conference in Huangshan, east China's Anhui Province, Sept. 5, 2024.

The ILRS is a scientific experimental facility designed to be an expandable and maintainable system capable of long-term robotic operation with short-term human participation on the moon.
The project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will see a basic facility built by 2035 in the lunar south pole region, while the second phase aims to establish a network connecting the moon's south pole, equator and far side by 2050.
CONCERTED EFFORTS
Wu Weiren, director and chief scientist of Deep Space Exploration Lab (DSEL), said at an ongoing space conference in east China's Huangshan city that the ILRS adheres to the principles of mutual consultation, joint construction and shared benefits to foster collaborative efforts with global partners.

Speaking at the conference, Wu Yanhua, chief designer of the country's major deep space exploration project, extended an invitation to nations worldwide to participate in the two-phase program at various levels, including concept study, equipment, system and even mission levels.
Wu Yanhua also announced that China is planning to establish multiple international organizations, including a cooperation committee, an expert consultative committee, a tech innovation alliance, a science alliance and a coordination headquarters, to enhance global collaboration efforts.
Following the successful operation of payloads from the European Space Agency (ESA), France, Italy and Pakistan in China's Chang'e-6 mission, the country's Chang'e-7 lunar exploration mission, scheduled for launch around 2026, will carry six international scientific instruments. Chang'e-8, targeting a launch around 2028, will offer 200 kilograms of international payload capacity. Chang'e-8 and Chang'e-7 will finally be part of the basic model of ILRS.

Ayman Ahmed, senior director of space program at the Egyptian Space Agency, proudly introduced an AI-enabled camera at a seminar during the two-day conference on Friday. This camera, set to be part of the Chang'e-7 mission, is currently in the testing phase, supported by the Changchun Institute of Optics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
ILRS is a space program that aims to provide ""a synergy in international lunar exploration on the basis of the set of complex research facilities on and around the Moon,"" said Dmitrii Zarubin, an engineering fellow of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Russia's payload PmL-Ch7 is slated to be brought into orbit by Chang'e-7, according to Zarubin.
""Free riding plus data sharing is the selection principle and cooperation philosophy,"" said Han Siyuan, an official of the CNSA, on Friday.
PASSIONATE PARTNERS
Senegal is a new partner in the ILRS cooperation initiative. On Sept. 5, the CNSA and its counterpart in Senegal signed an agreement, following a joint statement released earlier this week that emphasized deepening bilateral relations and establishing a high-level China-Senegal community with a shared future.

During the conference, the DSEL inked memoranda of understanding with 10 institutions from countries including Serbia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Panama and South Africa. Among the institutions are the Belt and Road Alliance for Science &Technology, the Foundation for Space Development Africa, and the Africa Business Alliance.
Adriana Marais, director of the Foundation for Space Development Africa, expressed her excitement about the collaboration between China and Africa at the educational, scientific and partnership levels for lunar exploration.
Marais, a visiting scientist in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, is advancing her Africa2Moon Project, which aims to send Africa's first mission to the moon. She is now particularly focused on the Chang'e-8 mission and considers it a significant opportunity.
Wiphu Rujopakarn, deputy director general of the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, said that space cooperation with China will benefit the people of his own country.
""This year, we have collaborated with the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory to connect our radio telescope in Thailand with Chinese ones, forming a very long baseline interferometry observation network,"" Rujopakarn said.
Thailand has also worked on the development of a science payload set to enter the lunar orbit with Chang'e-7. ""If the collaboration is successful, it could also serve as a model to demonstrate to other ASEAN members,"" Rujopakarn added. Among Asian nations involved in China's lunar exploration programs, Pakistan has already begun to reap the benefits. In May, China delivered data provided by a cube satellite aboard its Chang'e-6 spacecraft to Pakistan.
The cube satellite, ICUBE-Q, developed by Pakistan's Institute of Space Technology and China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University, was sent to space, together with the Chang'e-6 orbiter, to carry out exploration activities such as capturing images of the moon.

This is the first image of the moon taken by the cube satellite ICUBE-Q, developed by Pakistan's Institute of Space Technology and China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University, on May 8, 2024. (China National Space Administration/Handout via Xinhua)
China and Pakistan have also signed a cooperation agreement on the ILRS and China has already received Pakistan's application for payload cooperation on the Chang'e-8 mission.
EDUCATION FOR FUTURE
Nurturing young talent for future space exploration is equally crucial, if not more, for numerous nations in the Global South.
""Our population may not yet fully realize the importance of developing lunar exploration or space programs,"" said Maram Kaire, director-general of the Senegalese Space Studies Agency, noting that the country is still facing challenges in power supply and space education.
China's lunar exploration initiatives could be ""one of the best ways for Senegal to seize the opportunity to cultivate young space scientists and simultaneously build the necessary infrastructure,"" Kaire said.
Highlighting Africa's large youth population, Marais said that space education collaboration with China can ""prepare the next generation of humans to become excited about space exploration and to share knowledge, skills, infrastructure and capabilities.""
""The idea of looking back at Africa from the moon with African designed, African-built mission, in partnership with China, will be a huge inspiration for young people for years to come,"" Marais said.
Jing Guifei, deputy director of the regional center for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific affiliated to the United Nations, outlined the goals of ILRS education and training. The goals include nurturing specialized engineering technicians and project management experts for developing countries in areas such as short-term projects, space law and policy, and the design of micro and cube satellites.
Relying on this UN institution, China has trained nearly 1,000 space professionals, according to a white paper released by the country in 2022.
China deems the peaceful exploration, development and utilization of outer space as rights equally enjoyed by all countries, the white paper stressed.
""As a major spacefaring nation, it is our country's responsibility to provide a platform for scientists and peers from countries around the world,"" Wu Weiren said.
""Space is a shared domain, a common dream, and a collective treasure for humanity,"" said Chinese astronaut Zhai Zhigang who made history as the country's first person to conduct a spacewalk. ""Our aspiration to build and seek new homes in space is a testament to the unity and relentless efforts of global space pioneers.""

 (Xinhua) 21:06, September 06, 2024

A drone photo shows a Chinese scientific expedition base camp, located 2 to 3 km from the end of No. 10 glacier of the Purog Kangri Glacier in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, Sept. 4, 2024.
China launched a scientific expedition in Lhasa on Aug. 18 to investigate the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau -- known as Asia's ""water tower"" -- with a target region encompassing ""one glacier, two lakes and three rivers.""
The region is home to Purog Kangri Glacier, the largest glacier in the world, located in the mid to low-latitude regions, as well as Siling Lake and Namtso Lake, the largest and second-largest lakes in Xizang, respectively. It is also the birthplace of the Yangtze River, Nujiang River and Yarlung Zangbo River.
Over the past 20 years, the climate and environment in the region have experienced dramatic changes, including accelerated glacier retreat and rapid lake expansion. These transformations have affected the structure and function of the regional ecosystem, with significant implications for human survival and development.
This scientific expedition, based on an Earth system science perspective, will identify the characteristics of regional climate and ecological changes and reveal the mechanisms behind these changes. (Xinhua/Liu Shiping)

China outlines blueprint for international lunar research station
 (Xinhua) 21:21, September 05, 2024
HEFEI, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Through global cooperation, China is set to construct an international lunar research station (ILRS) with a network linking the moon's south pole, equator and far side by 2050, according to a key engineer in the country's space industry.
The blueprint for an expandable, maintainable system capable of long-term robotic operations with short-term human participation on the moon was revealed by Wu Yanhua, chief designer of the major Chinese deep space exploration project, in a speech at the second International Deep Space Exploration Conference in Tunxi of Huangshan City, east China's Anhui Province.
The ILRS, a scientific experimental facility consisting of sections on the lunar surface, in lunar orbit and on Earth, is projected to be built in two phases: a basic model to be built by 2035 in the lunar south pole region, and an extended model to be built by about 2050.
Per the blueprint, the extended model will be a comprehensive lunar station network that utilizes the lunar orbit station as its central hub and the south pole station as its primary base, and it will include exploration nodes on the lunar equator and the far side of the moon, according to Wu.
The extended model will be capable of laying a foundation for manned landings on Mars in the future, Wu said. China is currently planning to land astronauts on the moon by 2030.
In his speech, Wu mapped out the composition of the planned ILRS, which will be powered by solar, radioisotope and nuclear generators. It will also include lunar-Earth and high-speed lunar surface communication networks, as well as lunar vehicles like a hopper, an unmanned long-range vehicle, and pressurized and unpressurized manned rovers.
Wu noted that orbital and lunar-surface refueling stations, a launch vehicle, an orbiter, a landing-and-ascent vehicle, and a return capsule are in development to ensure Earth-moon transportation.
At the conference, Wu invited nations around the world to participate in the program across different tiers, which include concept study, equipment, system and mission levels.

AI trainer emerges as promising job in China
By Huang Xiaohui (People's Daily) 16:42, September 04, 2024
Switching on the computer and starting an intelligent training software, artificial intelligence (AI) trainer Yang Hongxu began his work. His recent task is to train an AI model that can autonomously recognize bank wire transfer applications.
Yang works for Data Grand, a company located in Shanghai Pudong Software Park, specialized in intelligent text processing. The AI models developed by the company can read various types of text files, such as contracts, financial statements, and industry reports, and have been applied in scenarios such as bank transaction recognition, and contract auditing and comparison.
""Before training an AI model, the trainer needs to read relevant documents and extract and annotate key information,"" Yang said. He compares this process to a teacher preparing for a class, which is the foundation of training.

Yang Hongxu makes a plan for AI training. (People's Daily/Huang Xiaohui)
""We highlight and annotate important parts, and then 'feed' the AI models with 'useful' information, telling them which information to extract and in what format,"" said Yang, adding that AI trainers need to read tens of thousands of documents and train dozens of AI models each year.
Yang opened a scanned image of a remittance application form from a bank in the intelligent training software. He selected the fields such as ""transaction type,"" ""remitter name,"" ""account number,"" ""bank name,"" ""contact address,"" one by one and labeled them accordingly. Then he clicked the mouse to generate a training model.
Once the model was generated, he raised some practice questions for the AI model. He input the field information and compared the results generated by the AI model with the original text to evaluate how well it had learned.
Whenever he noticed any discrepancies between the generated results and the original text, he recorded and compiled them into a list. For example, an image in the document was not recognized, and an upright image was recognized as sideways. These issues were then collectively provided as feedback to the developers of the AI model for future improvements.
""After training, the AI model can independently extract and read the key information from similar text files, enabling it to execute human instructions more efficiently,"" Yang said.
While others may perceive tasks like document reading, data annotation, and result testing as monotonous, repetitive, and somewhat dull, Yang finds them effortless. His greatest joy is witnessing the increasing intelligence of the models he trains.
Yang, born in 1993, has congenital hearing impairment and needs to wear hearing aids to hear sounds. In 2014, he graduated from a vocational and technical college in Shanghai with a major in environmental design. He worked different jobs such as home interior designer, accounting clerk, and warehouse administrator.
""When communicating with clients, I often felt frustrated because my speech was not clear and fluent enough,"" Yang said.

Yang Hongxu (right) discusses AI training progress with a colleague. (People's Daily/Huang Xiaohui)
When he was feeling lost, the Disabled Persons' Federation in Pudong New Area recommended him for the AI trainer job at Data Grand. Despite having no programming skills and limited knowledge of AI, Yang decided to give it a try when he learned that the job mainly involved working with machines.
Yuan Shaoyang, head of operations and management of Data Grand, who recruited Yang, said that the first batch of AI trainers of the company mainly engaged in basic data annotation. The repetitive tasks and high volume of annotations require a great deal of patience, attention to detail, and focus, Yuan explained.
Over the course of five years, Yang, who is diligent, focused, and eager to learn, has earned a good reputation among his colleagues. Through training sessions organized by the company and his own efforts to learn, he gradually became proficient in tasks such as model processing, product testing, and client communication. In 2022, he became a certified Level-2 AI training instructor, among the first batch recognized by Shanghai.
To adapt to the rapid development of the AI industry, Yang has taken the initiative to learn mainstream programming languages for AI models so that he can write some simple code to address issues that arise with the models.
""For example, when I discover a problem with the trained model misinterpreting information, I can write a few lines of code to make some initial corrections instead of directly handing the problem over to the model developers,"" Yang said.
In order to improve himself, he is currently preparing for a certification exam for project manager of information systems.
AI is one of the three leading industries that Shanghai seeks to develop. In recent years, Shanghai has been strategically developing the industry in terms of computing power, language resources, models, testing, and application scenarios, while also increasing efforts in talent cultivation.
In 2022, Shanghai initiated the professional skill level certification for AI trainers, and so far, more than 450 people have become certified AI trainers.

The widespread application of digital technologies is directly connected to the tremendous progress that has been made in building a digital China. The country has accelerated steps to carry out reform related to the market-oriented allocation of data elements, and its digital economy has continuously expanded, according to the Digital China Development Report (2023) recently issued by the National Data Administration (NDA).
The expanding importance of data has been at the forefront of China's digital transformation.
By the end of 2023, more than 20 provinces had established specialized data trading institutions, with Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces ranking among the highest in terms of the number of data trading institutions in China.
China has seen a sea change in the scale and scope of data sharing since last year, said Hu Jianbo, vice president of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.
China's total data output reached 32.85 zettabytes (ZB) in 2023, up 22.44 percent year-on-year. By the end of last year, the country's data storage volume hit 1.73 ZB.
This year, the NDA will continue to roll out institutional documents focusing on data property rights, data circulation, revenue distribution, security governance, public data development and utilization, enterprise data development and utilization, high-quality development of the digital economy, and data infrastructure construction, said Liu Liehong, head of the NDA.
This will transform China's vast data resources into a new competitive advantage to promote high-quality development and contribute to advancing Chinese modernization, Liu added.
The value-added output of core industries in the digital economy in 2023 is expected to exceed 12 trillion yuan ($1.684 trillion), making up about 10 percent of China's GDP.
The digital transformation of the manufacturing sector has also been further promoted.
Last year, the numerical control rate of key processes and the penetration rate of R&D and design tools for digital transformation in major industrial enterprises reached 62.2 percent and 79.6 percent, up by 12.1 and 9.4 percentage points from 2019, respectively.
In 2023, China was home to 62 ""lighthouse factories"", accounting for 40 percent of the global total of such factories selected by the World Economic Forum as representing the highest level of global intelligent manufacturing.
China has maintained its position as the world's largest online retail market for 11 consecutive years. Last year, the county's e-commerce transaction volume approached 46.83 trillion yuan, up 9.4 percent from the previous year, and its online retail sales hit 15.42 trillion yuan.
""Thanks to the continuous improvement of digital infrastructure and basic systems for data, China's digital economy has made great strides in both technological and model innovation, and the platform economy has played an increasingly important role,"" said Ouyang Rihui, assistant dean of the Chinese Internet Economy Research Institute at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.
He added that the country has further pushed forward the digital transformation of various industries, and the scale of its digital economy has seen steady growth.

Digitalization is also improving how people connect with the government, public services, and cultural content.
China has maintained a leading position in the world in the realm of digital governance. Over 90 percent of government services are now available online, and online and one-stop services are provided for over 92.5 percent of the items requiring provincial administrative licensing.
The supply of digital cultural content is expanding and improving in quality. By the end of 2023, among the 1.86 million pieces of cultural relics preserved by the Palace Museum, 900,000 pieces had undergone digital collection, accounting for approximately 48 percent. The National Museum has achieved similar levels, with approximately 49 percent of cultural relics undergoing digital collection.
Digital education is developing equitably. As of Oct. 2023, schools at all levels and types achieved full internet coverage, with more than three-quarters of schools achieving wireless network coverage. By the end of 2023, the National Smart Education Platform had gathered 88,000 resources for primary and secondary schools, a year-on-year increase of 100 percent. 10,000 high quality courses for vocational education were also uploaded, a nearly tenfold increase year-on-year.
The building of a digital China and the accelerated development of new quality productive forces will boost the vitality and resilience of the Chinese economy, Ouyang said. Digitalization is a powerful engine to advance Chinese modernization in an accelerated manner.

The China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) jointly released a series of global images of Mars obtained during China's first Mars exploration mission. (CNSA/Handout via Xinhua)
BEIJING, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- A study by Chinese researchers has confirmed the feasibility of continuously producing fiber materials from Martian soil, indicating that ""in-situ resource utilization"" could be achieved in the construction of future Mars bases.
A research team from the Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), in collaboration with various institutions including the CAS Institute of Geochemistry and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, successfully simulated Martian soil using Earth-based basalt and produced continuous Martian soil fibers through melt-drawing experiments, the ScienceNet.cn reported on Monday.
The researchers also analyzed the impact of factors such as Martian low gravity and the planet's unique atmosphere -- characterized by low pressure and inert atmosphere -- on the fiber production process and performance.
The research findings confirm the feasibility of producing continuous, controllable-diameter fiber materials from Martian soil. These fibers could be used in the preparation of fiber-reinforced composite materials, which have important application value for using Martian soil to build future Martian bases, said Ma Pengcheng, who led the research team.
Ma's team has long been committed to the study and application of high-performance basalt fiber.
""Although physical samples of Martian soil are currently not available, basalt, which is widely found on Earth, is very similar to Martian soil in terms of chemical composition, mineral composition, and similar melting behavior,"" Ma added.
In recent years, the research team has conducted extensive experiments using basalt to simulate Martian soil, which showed that the simulated Martian soil could be completely melted at 1,360 degrees Celsius, and no obvious crystal precipitation occurred during the melting-cooling process.
The molten material transformed into an amorphous glassy state after quenching, demonstrating excellent properties for further fiber production, according to Ma.
Based on these experimental results, the researchers used the melt-drawing method to produce continuous Martian soil fibers. After further analysis, it was found that lower drawing speeds result in a denser atomic structure in the soil fibers, enhancing their resistance to external damage and improving their mechanical properties, Ma noted.

3 Chinese sites listed as world geological heritages by IUGS,2024-09-03,http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0903/c90000-20213951.html,"Home>>
		
3 Chinese sites listed as world geological heritages by IUGS
 (Xinhua) 16:56, September 03, 2024
NANJING, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- Three geological sites in China, comprising vegetation fossils, dinosaur fossils and a karst landform, have recently been listed as Geological Heritage Sites by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).
These newly selected sites include the Permian vegetation of the Wuda Fossil Site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Dashanpu Middle Jurassic Dinosaur Fossils Site in southwest China's Sichuan Province and the Guilin Karst in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said Zhang Jianping, vice-chair of the IUGS International Commission on Geoheritage and a professor at the China University of Geosciences, Beijing, at a press conference held by the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIGPAS) on Tuesday.
So far, a total of 10 Chinese geological sites have been included in the list of the IUGS Geological Heritage Sites.
Geological heritages are a precious and non-renewable resource that faithfully records the 4.6 billion years of evolution history of the Earth and bases for geologists to conduct scientific research.
The IUGS Geological Heritage Sites are key places with the highest scientific international relevance, used as a global reference, and with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history, according to the IUGS.
The three newly selected sites are outstanding representatives of China's geological relics and they have been internationally recognized for their scientific value, research significance and current protection status, Zhang said.
VEGETATIONAL POMPEII
The Wuda Permian vegetation fossil site, dubbed the ""Vegetational Pompeii,"" features a peat-forming tropical rainforest preserved in remarkable detail by volcanic ash. This ancient forest, dating back approximately 298 million years, was buried by ash-fall and now appears as a tuff bed between two coal seams in the Wuda coalfield, according to Wang Jun, director of NIGPAS.
The plant remains are well-preserved, with some retaining anatomical structures. The site provides extensive evidence of the intricate details of an ancient tropical rainforest community and interactions between various organisms, Wang said. ""This site offers a unique window to understand past floral community ecology.""
The Wuda fossil site is exceptional for best demonstrating what plants formed coal and what a coal-forming forest looked like, he added.
Discovered in 1998 and identified as a forest buried by ash in 2003, the site has since been studied by an international research team of about 30 experts from Britain, the United States, the Czech Republic, Germany and China, who have published over 60 research papers.
JURASSIC PARK
At the Dashanpu Middle Jurassic Dinosaur Fossils Site in Zigong City, Sichuan Province, over 200 specimens of dinosaurs and other vertebrates have been uncovered. According to Zeng Xiaoyun, curator of the Zigong Dinosaur Museum, these include 29 species across 26 genera, such as sauropods, theropods, basal neornithischians, stegosaurs, as well as fish, amphibians, turtles, crocodiles, pterosaurs and therapsids.
This site not only boasts the highest concentration of Middle Jurassic dinosaurs but also exhibits remarkable vertebrate diversity. Described by Zeng as a ""Jurassic park,"" it is acclaimed as ""a dinosaur quarry and a world wonder.""
The site has yielded unique bone structures that are crucial for inferring dinosaur behaviors. It fills gaps in the history of dinosaur evolution and provides exceptionally valuable samples for studying dinosaurs from various perspectives and their relationships with other vertebrates, Zeng said.
The Dashanpu site, spanning an area of about 70,000 square meters, was first uncovered in 1972. An on-site museum was built thereafter. Extensive studies have been carried out by scientists from home and abroad.
KARST WITH SCIENTIFIC AND ARTISTIC VALUE
Guilin Karst features beautiful continental tower and cone karst formations around the Lijiang River and its tributaries, as well as many caves. Shaped by Paleozoic tectonic movements, the Guilin Karst has created a unique basin that is ideal for karst development, said Chen Weihai, deputy chief engineer of the Institute of Karst Geology of the China Geological Survey.
The geomorphological setting, enriched by thick carbonate deposits and a warm, humid climate with plentiful rainfall, fosters extensive karst phenomena. Guilin's geological stability and comparatively slow tectonic uplift, unlike more rapidly uplifting regions in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, enhance its scientific relevance, making it an outstanding location for studying karst processes and their environmental impacts, Chen said.
Research on Guilin Karst dates back to the 17th century when the Chinese traveler and geographer Xu Xiake explored 88 caves. Contemporary studies focus on understanding karst dynamics and evolution models, as well as the aesthetic influence of Guilin's landscapes on Chinese paintings and poetry.

In a banana seedling cultivation room of Crossfrontier International Ltd. in Kenya, rows of cultivation bottles filled with seedlings were neatly arranged. Lucy Mimano, the company's CEO, was carefully examining the growth of these seedlings.
""It is crucial to consider the preparation of nutrient solution, the method of inoculating tissue culture seedlings, and specific factors such as temperature, humidity, and light conditions during the cultivation phase,"" said Mimano.
Mimano had attended a training program organized by the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS), where she learned about the tissue culture technique for banana seedlings. To gain expertise in this technique, she visited the CATAS for a 28-day study program in 2014.
""Chinese experts provided me with detailed guidance on how to efficiently develop the banana industry from production and management perspectives, which was of tremendous help to me,"" said Mimano.
After returning to Kenya, she invested in and established the largest factory for producing tissue-cultured banana seedlings in the country, providing disease-free banana seedlings to farmers and enterprises in East and Central Africa. This has effectively promoted the development of the banana industry in Kenya.
Mimano is not the only one. Every year, the CATAS welcomes groups of Africans to learn tropical agricultural techniques through visits and on-site learning and later apply their skills back in their home countries. In recent years, the CATAS has trained nearly 3,000 agricultural technicians from Africa.
Besides, the CATAS has actively established platforms for international exchanges and cooperation, and conducted technical training for foreign assistance. Over 100 expert visits have been made abroad to carry out foreign-aid projects in tropical agriculture.
In recent years, China and Africa have deepened their cooperation in agricultural technology under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. By the end of 2023, China had established 24 agricultural technology demonstration centers in Africa. These facilities have boosted crop yields by an average of 30 to 60 percent in relevant regions, helping African countries improve their agricultural development and contributing Chinese wisdom to Africa's agricultural modernization.
""In the future, we plan to implement various programs in Africa's main agricultural regions. These will focus on crops like cassava and plantains, and include techniques such as localized breeding, improved seed replacement, advanced cultivation techniques, post-harvest loss reduction and comprehensive utilization, and agricultural mechanization. Our goal is to help African countries increase their crop yields and enhance their capacity for self-sufficient food security,"" said Li Jihua, vice president of the CATAS.
Recently, the workshop on China-Africa Agricultural Science and Technology Cooperation was held in Sanya, south China's Hainan province. More than 130 representatives from agricultural research institutions, regional organizations, and enterprises in China and African countries came together to discuss topics such as innovation in China-Africa agricultural science and technology cooperation.
China's tremendous success in increasing crop yields and advancing agricultural modernization through continuous technological innovation is something that Africa aspires to, said Felix Dapare Dakora, former president of the African Academy of Sciences.
