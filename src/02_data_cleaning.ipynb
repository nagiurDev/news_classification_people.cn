transition and sustainable development  It was organized by GEIDCO  a non-profit international organization headquartered in Beijing and dedicated to promoting sustainable energy development worldwide  Guan Xiupeng  vice director of GEIDCO General Office  told Xinhua that China  vast territory  with diverse geographical features such as deserts  forests  plateaus and permafrost areas  has an impact on economic and social development   Based on such conditions  China has explored electricity technologies and development models that are suitable for its development and has accumulated a wealth of experience on project construction  which can also be shared with other countries  especially in the Global South   he added  The research report mentioned that China is at the technological forefront in new energy power generation  Ultra High Voltage  UHV  power transmission  flexible direct current transmission  and the digitization and intelligentization of electricity systems  Taking UHV for example  The development of UHV technology is driven by the long distance between China  clean energy resources  mostly in the western regions  and consumption centers in east China  It has not only solved the problem of long-distance  large-capacity power transmission but also realized the mass consumption of clean energy  On the other side of the globe  UHV technology has found its place in Brazil  a country with abundant hydropower resource in tropical rainforest in its northern part  and densely populated areas in the south  The State Grid  poration of China  SGCC   a leading state-owned utility company  has applied the technologies and experience earned at home to this South American country  including 800kV UHV direct current transmission technology  which sends electricity from the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant in Para state to big cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo  The mega-project traverses a vast area  stretching more than 2 000 km over tropical rainforests and rivers  to supply the power consumption of some 22 million people  about 10 percent of the Brazilian population  As of now  180 billion kWh hydropower has been delivered via the project  equivalent to saving 64 million tonnes of standard coal or cutting 170 million tonnes of CO2 emission  The project strictly complies to environmental regulations  When laying power transmission lines  the engineering teams bypassed the local indigenous settlements and ecological conservation areas in accordance with local laws and regulations  In 2019  it was recognized as the best social and environmental management practice in Brazil  Besides the project construction  Chinese companies also promote technology transfer by training local talent for long-term operation and maintenance  with the smart electricity meter project in Saudi Arabia as one such example  The agreement for the project was signed by SGCC and Saudi Electricity  pany in 2019  and included the installation of 5 million electricity meters and the development of supporting facilities  Technology services  equipment integration  trial tests  and maintenance and personnel training were also part of the project  which was the largest deployment of smart electricity meters in the world at the time  Deng Guoxue  one of the project experts from SGCC  was busy not only with installation work  but also with running local personnel training classes  He developed a set of English training materials  including textbooks  lecture notes and student manuals for his Saudi colleagues  Ihab Mohammad  one of the local trainees  said he had witnessed the diligence  responsibility and professionalism of the SGCC employees  who have completed a high-quality project with their wisdom and hardwork to benefit the local people  The Chinese contractors not only build power systems  but also bring domestic experience to the field of environmental protection  enhancing the overall environmental level of the projects  Located in the coastal  sandy area of Binh Dinh Province in Vietnam  the Phu My 330-megawatt photovoltaic power station is a major new energy project in Vietnam  National Power Development Plan 7  and is the largest photovoltaic power station in central Vietnam  The Power  struction  poration of China  the project contractor  also considered the various application potentials during the project  design  such as expansion of energy storage  hydrogen and ammonia production  and desalination of seawater by green electricity  As of the end of April 2023  the project had generated and sent a total of 695 million kWh of electricity to the grid  equivalent to cutting 670 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions  or saving 220 000 tonnes of standard coal  The project also transformed and utilized about 325 hectares of desertified and barren land  significantly reducing dust storms and improving local environment   \n",

ceremony  presents China  proposals for global AI governance  This year  WAIC featured the first High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance  Over three days  a total of 1 300 guests from more than 50 countries and regions participated in thematic discussions  Xue Lan  dean of Schwarzman  lege and head of the Institute for AI International Governance of Tsinghua University  said that to promote global AI governance  it is important to strengthen collaborative governance  expand multi-level and multi-channel bilateral and multilateral exchanges and dialogues  and advance international AI big science cooperation to jointly address the risks and challenges brought by AI technology   A keynote speech is given at a main forum on industrial development of the 2024 World AI  ference  WAIC  held in a meeting hall of the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and  vention Center  in east China  Shanghai  July 4  2024   People  Daily Online Chen Yuyu  This conference featured 107 forums  focusing on topics such as model algorithms and computing power  embodied intelligence  and industrial ecology  When discussing the future development of large models  Zhang Yaqin  dean of the Institute for AI Industry Research  Tsinghua University  outlined several key trends  He said that the development of these models will become multimodal  cross-modal  and multi-scale  predicting that AI will soon be integrated into edge devices like TVs  smartphones  and cars  Moreover  he said that large models will evolve into tools for developing intelligent agents capable of autonomous task planning  code writing  tool manipulation  and path optimization  Zhang further explained that large models have already been applied to enhance the automation and intelligence of physical infrastructure such as transportation systems  communications networks  and power grids  paving the way for embodied intelligence  He also foresaw a future where large models are interfaced directly with biological systems  potentially leading to a groundbreaking fusion of digital  physical  and biological intelligence  It is reported that the 2024 WAIC brought together 132 procurement groups and identified 126 project procurement needs  with an estimated total purchase amount of 15 billion yuan   2 06 billion   Additionally  24 major industrial projects were signed up  with a total investment of over 40 billion yuan   \n"
